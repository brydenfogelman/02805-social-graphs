For example, \u017di\u017eek's appropriation of Lacan's discussion of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] in his 1959/1960 seminar, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis''. In this seminar, Lacan uses Antigone to defend the claim that "the only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire" (Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'', Verso: London, 1994; p.&nbsp;69). However, as Parker notes, Antigone's act (burying her dead brother in the knowledge that she will be buried alive) was never intended to effect a revolutionary change in the political status quo; yet, despite this, \u017di\u017eek frequently cites Antigone as a paradigm of ethico-political action.</ref> Similarly, according to some critics, \u017di\u017eek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from the more problematic Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in [[parapraxis]], or "slips-of-the-tongue." We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog,' and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.<ref>Noah Horwitz, "Contra the Slovenians: Returning to Lacan and away from Hegel" (''Philosophy Today'', Spring 2005, pp.&nbsp;24\u201332.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn a very negative review of \u017di\u017eek\u2019s magnum opus "Less than Nothing", the British political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] attacked \u017di\u017eek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his \u2018formless radicalism\u2019 which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized.

His main thesis on Christianity reminds how the fall is not associated to any ethical fault, but to the perverse core of Christianity which does not eliminate the sin from the creation. In the Christology, Christ should be betrayed in order to becoming in God and live forever. Rather, Korstanje adds that \u017di\u017eek did not the correct diagnosis because it is not the Christ` myth the founder of Capitalist system, but Noah`s Ark where God asks to his salved man to organize a real genocide. The universal flood, which is a myth enrooted in the core of Christianity and Judaism, appeals to mass-death as a platform of redemption dividing the world in two, victims and witnesses. Following this, if the medieval man lived to die, the modern citizens have developed a profound fear to death. Nowadays, the society or risk sets the pace to a new society, Thana Capitalism where death played a vital role as the many commodity and mediation between peoples and their institutions. The consumption of Others` death by means of TV, Programs, Journalism, Newspapers, Realities shows, or the visit to dark tourism sites, are valid indicators of the modern obsession for consuming mass-suffering or disasters. This means that people feel happier when others die because in that way they avoid to be touched by destiny. Beyond betrayal as \u017di\u017eek said, the asymmetries of (Thana) Capitalism are legitimized by the introduction of [[social Darwinism]] where few hands have much while many die with nothing. Not only through media but through cultural entertainment, enjoying from other`s disgraces has situated as the main ideology of Thana Capitalism. The intersection of media with terrorism operates under this logic.Though news of terrorist attacks horrorize social imaginary, nobody can escape to their atractiveness.<ref>Korstanje M El Títere y El Enano: el núcleo perverso del Cristianismo.
