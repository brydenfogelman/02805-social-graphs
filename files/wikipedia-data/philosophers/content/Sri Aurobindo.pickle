After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the [[maharaja]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and began increasingly involved in [[Indian National Congress|nationalist politics]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti|nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal]]. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but was only convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against [[British India|British rule]] in India. He was released when no evidence was provided. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] work.\u000a\u000aDuring his stay in Pondicherry, Aurobindo developed a method of spiritual practice he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life [[divine]]. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but transformed his nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (referred to as "The Mother"), he founded the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]]. He died on 5 December 1950 in Pondicherry.\u000a\u000aHis main literary works are ''The Life Divine'', which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; ''Synthesis of Yoga'', which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and ''[[Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol]]'', an [[epic poem]]. His works also include philosophy, poetry, translations and commentaries on the ''[[Vedas]]'', ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.

His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then Assistant Surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangapur]] in Bengal, and a former member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of [[evolution]] while pursuing medical studies in Britain.{{efn|Aurobindo described his father as a "tremendous atheist" but Thakur calls him an agnostic and Heehs believes that he followed his own coda.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3\u20137, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}}} His mother was Swarnalotta Devi, whose father was [[Rajnarayan Bose|Shri Rajnarayan Bose]], a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth. Aurobindo had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and [[Manmohan Ghose|Manmohan]], a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, [[Barindra Kumar Ghosh|Barindrakumar]] (also referred to as Barin, born Emmanuel Matthew).{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3\u20137, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}\u000a\u000aYoung Aurobindo was brought up speaking English but used [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] to communicate with servants. Although his family were [[Bengali people|Bengali]], his father believed British culture to be superior to that of his countrymen. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto House]] boarding school in [[Darjeeling]], in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=8\u20139|ps=}}\u000a\u000a=== England (1879\u20131893) ===\u000a\u000a[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|125px|thumb|upright||left|Aurobindo (seated center next to his mother) and his family.

To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9\u201310|ps=}}{{efn|Krishna Dhun Ghose returned to India soon after, leaving his wife in the care of a physician in London. Barindra was born in England in January 1880.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}}} The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in [[Manchester]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9\u201310|ps=}} Drewett was a minister of the  [[Congregational Church]] whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=10, 13|ps=}}{{efn|While in Manchester, the Ghose brothers lived first at 84 Shakespeare Street and then, by the time of the 1881 census, at 29 York Place, [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]].

This was a prerequisite  for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, [[French language|French]], geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British Raj as a "heartless government".{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}\u000a[[File:Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue with Sri Aurobindo Blue Plaque.JPG|thumb|250px|upright| Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue, London W12 with Sri Aurobindo [[Blue Plaque]]]]\u000aDrewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] there.{{efn|Benoybhusan's education ended in Manchester.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}}}} He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=14\u201318|ps=}} A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, from 1884 to 1887.{{sfn|English Heritage|ps=}} The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in [[South Kensington]] during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Henry Cotton]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=18|ps=}}\u000a\u000aBy 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}} To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of [[Oscar Browning]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|pp=29\u201330|ps=}} He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College.{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}} Sri Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=31|ps=}}\u000a\u000aAt this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]], was travelling in England.

He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=42|ps=}} At Baroda, Sri Aurobindo self-studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=43|ps=}}\u000a[[File:Bande mataram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Copy of ''Bande Mataram'', September 1907]]\u000aDuring his stay at Baroda he contributed to many articles to ''Indu Prakash'' and spoke as a chairman of the Baroda college board.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=68|ps=}} He started taking an active interest in the politics of India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and [[Madhya Pradesh]], while traveling to these states. He established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]]. He arranged the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee ([[Niralamba Swami]]) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=77|ps=}}\u000a\u000aAurobindo often traveled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and other Bengali relatives, including his cousin Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increasingly to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. Age 28, he had married 14-year-old Mrinalini, daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service, when he visited Calcutta in 1901. Mrinalini died in December 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=53|ps=}}\u000a\u000aAurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured [[Non-cooperation movement|non-co-operation]] and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=71|ps=}}\u000a[[File:Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, with Tilak speaking, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Right|Sri Aurobindo seated at the table, with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] speaking: Surat session of congress, 1907]]\u000aIn Bengal, with Barin's help, he established contacts with revolutionaries, inspiring radicals such as [[Bagha Jatin]], Jatin Banerjee and Surendranath Tagore. He helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the [[Anushilan Samiti]] of Calcutta in 1902.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=67|ps=}}\u000a\u000aAurobindo attended the 1906 [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] meeting headed by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of "Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott and national education". In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led with extremists along with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]. The Congress split after this session.{{sfnp|Thorpe|2010|p=29|ps=C}} In 1907\u20131908 Aurobindo traveled extensively to [[Pune]], Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the [[Alipore Bomb Case]]. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial and released after a year of isolated incarceration.\u000a\u000aOnce out of the prison he started two new publications, ''Karmayogin'' in English and ''Dharma'' in Bengali. He also delivered the [[s:Uttarpara Speech|Uttarpara Speech]] hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where Britain's [[secret police]] monitored his activities.{{sfnp|Lorenzo|1999|p=70|ps=}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=217|ps=}}\u000a\u000a=== Conversion from politics to spirituality ===\u000a[[File:Aurobindo jail picture.JPG|thumb|upright|225px|left| Photographs of Aurobindo\u000aas a prisoner in [[Alipore Jail]], 1908.]]\u000aIn July 1905 then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Curzon]], partitioned Bengal. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=86|ps=}}\u000a\u000aDuring this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=61|ps=}}\u000a\u000aAurobindo said he was "visited" by [[Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail: "It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence."{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=98|ps=}}\u000a\u000aIn his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of [[Brahmananda]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=110|ps=}} <!--When Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan.{{clarify|reason=what plan?}}--> In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to [[Vishnu Bhaskar Lele]], a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=142\u2013143|ps=}}\u000a\u000aIn 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at [[Chandannagar]] while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in ''Karmayogin''. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a [[French colony]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=101|ps=}} The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.\u000a\u000a=== Pondicherry (1910\u20131950) ===\u000aIn Pondicherry, Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication were ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''Essays on The Gita'', ''The Secret of The Veda'', ''Hymns to the Mystic Fire'', ''The Upanishads'', ''The Renaissance in India'', ''War and Self-determination'', ''The Human Cycle'', ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' and ''The Future Poetry'' were published in this magazine.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=31\u201333|ps=}}\u000a\u000aAt the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in 1926.<ref name="Sketch">{{citation |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Life Sketch |series=Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library |volume=30 |url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}</ref> From 1926 he started to sign himself as ''Sri Aurobindo'', ''[[Sri]]'' (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an [[honorific]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=347|ps=: Sri Aurobindo without the surname seems to have first appeared in print in articles published in Chandernagore in 1920.

Some time later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the [[Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]] with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, she continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.{{sfnp|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=292\u2013293|ps=}}\u000a\u000a== Philosophy and spiritual vision ==\u000a{{Main article|Integral yoga}}\u000a{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style="float:right;"\u000a|-\u000a! colspan=6 | Aurobindo's model of Being and Evolution{{sfn|Wilber|1992|p=263}}{{sfn|Sharma|1992}}\u000a\u000a|- header row 2\u000a| colspan=5 align=center | '''Levels of Being'''\u000a| rowspan=2 | '''Development'''\u000a\u000a|- header row 3\u000a| align=center           | '''Overall'''\u000a| align=center colspan=2 | '''Outer Being'''\u000a| align=center           | '''Inner Being'''\u000a| align=center           | '''Psychic Being'''\u000a\u000a|- Universalizing\u000a| Aurobindo-Overall rowspan=2 align=center       | Supermind\u000a| Aurobindo-OIP rowspan=2 colspan=4 align=center | [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|Supermind]]\u000a| Aurobindo-Development                          | Gnostic Man\u000a\u000a|- 1\u000a| Aurobindo-Development | Supra-mentalisation\u000a\u000a|- 2\u000a| Aurobindo-Overall rowspan=5 align=center | Mind\u000a| Aurobindo-Outer colspan=1 rowspan=4      |\u000a| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center      | Overmind\u000a| Aurobindo-Development rowspan=4          | Psychisation<br>and<br>Spiritualisation\u000a\u000a|- 3\u000a| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center | Intuition\u000a\u000a|- 4\u000a| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center | Illuminated Mind\u000a\u000a|- 5\u000a| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center | Higher Mind\u000a\u000a|- 6\u000a| Aurobindo-Sub rowspan=1 align=center              | Subconscient<br>mind\u000a| Aurobindo-Outer colspan=1 rowspan =1 align=center | Mind proper\u000a| Aurobindo-I rowspan=1 align=center                | Subliminal<br>(inner)<br>mind\u000a| Aurobindo-P rowspan=3                             |\u000a| Aurobindo-D rowspan=3 align=center                | Evolution\u000a\u000a|- 10\u000a| Aurobindo-Overall         | Vital\u000a| Aurobindo-Sub             | Subconsc.<br>Vital\u000a| Aurobindo-Outer           | Vital\u000a| Aurobindo-Inner colspan=1 | Subl.<br>(inner)<br>Vital\u000a\u000a|- 11\u000a| Aurobindo-Overall         | Physical\u000a| Aurobindo-sub             | Subconsc.<br>Physical\u000a| Aurobindo-Outer           | Physical\u000a| Aurobindo-Inner colspan=1 | Subl.
