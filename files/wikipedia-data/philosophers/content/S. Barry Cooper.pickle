Barry Cooper''' (9 October 1943 \u2013 26 October 2015) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[computability theory|computability theorist]]. He was a [[Professor]] of [[Pure Mathematics]] at the [[University of Leeds]]. \u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aCooper grew up in [[Bognor Regis]] and attended Chichester High School for Boys, during which time he played scrum-half for the under-15s England rugby team.<ref>[http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-d0cc-World-leading-mathematician-and-activist-Barry-Cooper-dies Obituary by Peter Lazenby in the Morning Star]</ref>\u000a\u000aCooper graduated from [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1966, and in 1970 received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[University of Leicester]] under the supervision of [[Reuben Goodstein]] and C.E.M. Yates, with a thesis entitled ''Degrees of Unsolvability''. In the 1970s, he was also a leading figure in the Chile Solidarity Campaign, welcoming Chilean refugees to Leeds.\u000a\u000aCooper was appointed [[Lecturer]] in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds in 1969, where he remained for the rest of his career.  He was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Mathematical Logic in 1991 and to Professor of Pure Mathematics in 1996. In 2011, he was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] \u000aat the [[University of Sofia|University of Sofia "St. Kliment Ohridski"]].\u000a\u000aHis book ''Computability Theory'' made the technical research area accessible to a new generation of students.  He was a leading mover of the return to basic questions of the kind considered by [[Alan Turing]], and of interdisciplinary developments related to computability. He was President of the Association [[Computability in Europe]], and Chair of the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) which \u000aco-ordinated the [[Alan Turing Year]]. The book ''Alan Turing: His Work and Impact'', edited by Cooper and [[Jan van Leeuwen]], won the [[Association of American Publishers]]\u2019 R. R. Hawkins Award.\u000a\u000aHe was a keen long-distance runner, and was also interested in jazz and improvised music, founding Leeds Jazz and being involved in the Termite Club. Cooper died on 26 October 2015 after a short illness.<ref>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/news/article/4935/Professor_Barry_Cooper University of Leeds, obituary announcement, published 30 October 2015]</ref>\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a*[http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/~pmt6sbc/ Home page of S.
