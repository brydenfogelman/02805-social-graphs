He has made notable contributions in [[set theory]] and in [[ergodic theory]].\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000a\u000aBorn in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], Foreman earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the\u000aUniversity of California, Berkeley in 1980 under [[Robert M. Solovay]]. His\u000adissertation title was ''Large Cardinals and Strong Model Theoretic Transfer\u000aProperties''.\u000a\u000aIn addition to his mathematical work, Foreman is an avid sailor. He and his family\u000asailed their sailboat  ''Veritas'' (a C&C 44 [[C&C Yachts]]) from North America to\u000aEurope in 2000. From 2000&ndash;2008 they sailed Veritas to the Arctic, the Shetland\u000aIslands, Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Spain, North Africa and Italy. Notable\u000ahigh points were Fastnet Rock, Irish and Celtic seas and many passages including the\u000aMaelstrom, Stad, Pentland Firth, Loch Ness, the Corryveckan and the Irish Sea.\u000aFurther south they sailed through the Chenal du Four and Raz de Sein, across the Bay\u000aof Biscay and around Cape Finisterre.  After entering Gibraltar, Foreman and his\u000afamily circumnavigated the Western Mediterranean with notable stops in Barcelona,\u000aMorocco, Tunisia, Sicily, Naples, Sardinia and Corsica. In 2009, Foreman and his son\u000aand guest crew circumnavigated Newfoundland.<ref>Foreman, Zachary (2007) "Under\u000aWay", Cruising World Magazine, October 2007</ref> Foreman has been recognized for\u000ahis sailing by twice winning the Ullman Trophy.<ref>Tailwind, [[Balboa Yacht Club]]\u000a"Annual Awards", 2003, 2011</ref>\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000aForeman began his career in set theory. His early work with [[W. Hugh Woodin|Hugh Woodin]] included\u000ashowing that it is consistent that the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) (see\u000a[[Continuum Hypothesis]]) fails at every infinite cardinal.<ref>Foreman, M.;\u000aWoodin, W. Hugh: The generalized continuum hypothesis can fail everywhere, \u000a''Ann. of Math.'', (2) '''133'''(1991), no. 1, 1&ndash;35</ref>\u000aIn joint work with [[Menachem Magidor|Magidor]] and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] he formulated [[Martin's maximum]], a provably\u000amaximal form of [[Martin's axiom]] and showed its consistency. <ref>Foreman, M.;\u000aMagidor, M.; Shelah, S.: Martin's maximum, saturated ideals, and nonregular\u000aultrafilters. I, ''[[Annals of Mathematics|Ann. of Math.]]'' (2), '''127'''(1988), no. 1, 1&ndash;47</ref>\u000a<ref>Foreman, M.; Magidor, M.; Shelah, S: Martin's maximum, saturated ideals and\u000anonregular ultrafilters. II, ''Ann. of Math.'', (2), '''127'''(1988), no. 3, 521&ndash;545.</ref>\u000aForeman's later work in set theory was primarily concerned with developing the\u000aconsequences of generic large cardinal axioms.<ref>Foreman, M.; Ideals and generic\u000aelementary embeddings. Handbook of Set Theory, Vol 2, pp. 885-1147, Springer, 2010.\u000a</ref> He also worked on classical "Hungarian" [[Infinitary combinatorics|partition relations]], mostly with\u000a[[András Hajnal]].<ref>Foreman, M; Hajnal, A.: A partition relation for successors of large\u000acardinals, ''[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]]'', '''325'''(2003), no. 3, 583\u2013623.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the late 1980s Foreman became interested in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] theory and [[ergodic theory]]. With [[Randall Dougherty]] he settled the Marczewski problem (1930) by showing\u000athat there is a Banach-Tarski decomposition of the unit ball in which all pieces\u000ahave the property of Baire (see [[Banach-Tarski paradox]]).<ref>Dougherty, R;\u000aForeman, M. Banach-Tarski decompositions using sets with the property of Baire. J.\u000aAmer. Math. Soc. 7 (1994), no. 1, 75\u2013124</ref> A consequence is the existence of a\u000adecomposition of an open dense subset of the unit ball into disjoint open\u000asets that can be rearranged by isometries to form two open dense subsets of the unit ball. With F. Wehrung, Foreman showed that the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] implied the\u000aexistence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set, even in the absence of any other form of\u000athe [[axiom of choice]].<ref>Foreman, M.; Wehrung, F. The Hahn-Banach theorem\u000aimplies the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set. Fund. Math. 138 (1991), no.\u000a1, 13\u201319.</ref>\u000a\u000aThis naturally led to attempts to apply the tools of [[descriptive set theory]] to\u000aclassification problems in [[ergodic theory]]. His first work in this direction,\u000awith F. Beleznay,<ref>Beleznay, F.; Foreman, M. The collection of distal flows is\u000anot Borel. Amer. J. Math. 117 (1995), no. 1, 203\u2013239.</ref> showed that classical\u000acollections were beyond the [[Borel hierarchy]] in complexity. This was followed\u000ashortly by a proof of the analogous results for measure preserving transformations\u000awith generalized discrete spectrum. In a collaboration with [[Benjamin Weiss]]\u000a<ref>Foreman, M.; [[Benjamin Weiss|Weiss, B.]]: An anti-classification theorem for ergodic measure\u000apreserving transformations, ''[[Journal of the European Mathematical Society|J. Eur. Math. Soc.]]'' (JEMS), '''6'''(2004), no. 3,\u000a277&ndash;292.</ref> and Daniel Rudolph <ref>Foreman, M.; Rudolph, D. J.; [[Benjamin Weiss|Weiss, B.]] The\u000aconjugacy problem in ergodic theory. Ann. of Math. (2) 173 (2011), no. 3,\u000a1529\u20131586.</ref> Foreman showed that no residual class of measure preserving\u000atransformations can have algebraic invariants and that the isomorphism relation on\u000aergodic measure preserving transformations in not Borel. This negative result\u000afinished a program proposed by von Neumann in the 1932.<ref>von Neumann, J. Zur\u000aOperatorenmethode in der klassischen Mechanik. Ann. of Math. (2), 33(3):587\u2013642,\u000a1932</ref> This result was extended by Foreman and Weiss to show that smooth area\u000apreserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus are unclassifiable.\u000a\u000aForeman's work in set theory continued during this period. He co-edited (with [[Akihiro Kanamori|Kanamori]]) the \u000a''Handbook of Set Theory''  and showed that various combinatorial properties of \u03c9<sub>2</sub> and\u000a\u03c9<sub>3</sub> are equiconsistent with [[huge cardinal]]s.<ref>Foreman, Matthew: [[Smoke and mirrors]]: combinatorial properties of small cardinals equiconsistent with huge cardinals, ''[[Advances in Mathematics|Adv.
