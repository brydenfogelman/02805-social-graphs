V{{About|the founder of the Eretrian school of philosophy}}\u000a'''Menedemus of [[Eretria]]''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u039c\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u1f18\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}}; 345/4 \u2013 261/0 BC{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|p=52}}) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] and founder of the [[Eretrian school]]. He learned philosophy first in [[Athens]], and then, with his friend [[Asclepiades of Phlius|Asclepiades]], he subsequently studied under [[Stilpo]] and [[Phaedo of Elis]]. Nothing survives of his philosophical views apart from a few scattered remarks recorded by later writers.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aMenedemus was born at [[Eretria]]. Though of noble birth, he worked as builder and tentmaker until he was sent with a military expedition to [[Megara]], from where he travelled to the [[Platonic Academy]] in [[Athens]] and resolved to devote himself to philosophy.<ref>Laërtius says he was charmed by [[Plato]] himself, but Plato was dead by the time Menedemus was born {{harv|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 126}}.</ref> At Megara he formed a lifelong friendship with [[Asclepiades of Phlius]], with whom he toiled in the night that he might study philosophy by day.<ref>[[Athenaeus]], iv. 168</ref> He was subsequently a pupil first of [[Stilpo]] and then of [[Phaedo of Elis]], whose school he transferred to Eretria, by which name it was afterwards known.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 126}}\u000a\u000aIn addition to his philosophical work, he took a leading part in the political affairs of his city from the time of the ''[[Diadochi]]'' until his death, and obtained a remission of the tribute to Demetrius. His friendship with [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] seems to have roused suspicion as to his loyalty, and he sought safety first in the temple of Amphiaraus at [[Oropus]], and later with Antigonus, at whose court he is said to have died of grief. Other accounts say that he starved himself to death on failing to induce Antigonus to free his native city.\u000a\u000a==Philosophy==\u000aHis philosophical views are known only in part. [[Athenaeus]] quotes [[Epicrates of Ambracia|Epicrates]] as stating that he was a [[Platonist]], but other accounts credit him with having preferred Stilpo to Plato. Diogenes Laërtius{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 134-135}} says that he declined to identify the Good with the Useful, and that he denied the value of the negative proposition on the ground that affirmation alone can express truth. In ethics we learn from [[Plutarch]]<ref>Plutarch, ''De Virtute Morali'' 2</ref> and from [[Cicero]]<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'' ii. 42</ref> that he regarded Virtue as one, by whatever name it be called, and maintained that it is intellectual. Cicero's evidence is the less valuable in that he always assumed that Menedemus was a follower of the [[Megarian school]]. Diogenes says that he left no writings, and the Eretrian school disappeared after a short and unobtrusive existence.\u000a\u000a==Notes==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a*{{cite book |last=Dorandi  |first=Tiziano |chapter=Chapter 2: Chronology |editor-last=Algra |editor-first=Keimpe |display-editors=etal |year=1999 |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |page=50 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521250283 |ref=harv}}\u000a*{{cite LotEP |chapter=Menedemus (book ii)}}\u000a\u000a'''Attribution:'''\u000a*{{EB1911}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Menedemus}}\u000a[[Category:4th-century BC Greek people]]\u000a[[Category:3rd-century BC Greek people]]\u000a[[Category:3rd-century BC philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Ancient Eretrians]]\u000a[[Category:Ancient Greek philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:340s BC births]]\u000a[[Category:260s BC deaths]]
