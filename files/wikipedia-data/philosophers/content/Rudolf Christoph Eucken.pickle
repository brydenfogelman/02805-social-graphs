He received the 1908 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] "in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life", after he had been nominated by a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=3471 nobelprize.org]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aEucken was born on 5 January 1846 in [[Aurich]], then in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (now [[Lower Saxony]]). His father, Ammo Becker Eucken (1792\u20131851) died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, Ida Maria (1814\u20131872, née Gittermann).<ref name="Bio2"/> He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the classical philologist and philosopher Ludwig Wilhelm Maximilian Reuter (1803\u20131881).<ref name=eb1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Eucken, Rudolf Christoph}}</ref> He studied at [[Göttingen University]] (1863\u201366), where [[Hermann Lotze]] was one of his teachers, and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]].<ref name=Bio2>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz19591.html|title=Biografie Rudolf Christoph Eucken (German)|publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> In the latter place, [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg]] was a professor whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him.\u000a\u000a==Career==\u000aEucken received his [[Ph.D.]] in classical [[philology]] and ancient [[history]] at [[Göttingen University]] in 1866 with a dissertation under the title ''De Aristotelis dicendi ratione''.<ref>The dissertation is available [https://archive.org/details/dearistotelisdi00euckgoog online at Internet Archive].</ref> However, the bent of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of [[theology]].<ref name="eb1911"/> In 1871, after five years working as a school teacher at [[Husum]], Berlin und [[Frankfurt]], he was appointed Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]], succeeding another of his former teachers at Göttingen, [[Gustav Teichmüller]]. He stayed there until 1874 when he took up a similar position at the [[University of Jena]].<ref name="eb1911"/> He stayed there until he retired in 1920. From 1913\u20131914 he served as guest lecturer at [[New York University]]. During [[World War I]], Eucken, like many of his academic colleagues, took a strong line in favour of the causes with which his country had associated itself.<ref>{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Eucken, Rudolf Christoph}}</ref><ref name="Bio2"/>\u000a\u000a[[File:Aurich, Ostfriesland, Osterstraße 27, Geburtshaus von Rudolf Eucken (2).JPG|thumb|Birthplace of Rudolf Eucken in Aurich, Osterstraße 27 (September 2015)]]\u000a\u000a==Ethical activism<!--'Ethical activism' and 'Activism (Eucken)' redirect here--->==\u000aEucken's philosophical work is partly historical and partly constructive, the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connexion between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is philosophy of life, the development of a new culture, not mere intellectualism, but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. This practical idealism Eucken described by the term "'''ethical activism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->."<ref name="Gibson"/> In accordance with this principle, Eucken gave considerable attention to social and educational problems.<ref name=eb1911/>\u000a\u000aHe maintained that humans have [[soul]]s, and that they are therefore at the junction between nature and spirit. He believed that people should overcome their non-spiritual nature by continuous efforts to achieve a spiritual life, another aspect of his ethical activism and [[meaning of life]].\u000a\u000a==Later life and death==\u000aHe married Irene Passow (1863\u20131941) in 1882 and had a daughter and two sons. His son [[Walter Eucken]] became a famous founder of [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] thought in [[Neoliberal economics|economics]]. His son [[Arnold Eucken]] was a chemist/physicist.<ref name="Bio2"/>\u000a\u000aRudolf Eucken died on 15 September 1926 in [[Jena]] at the age of 80.<ref name="Bio2"/>\u000a\u000a==Major works==\u000aHe was a prolific writer; his best-known works are:\u000a* ''Die Lebensanschauungen der großen Denker'' (1890; 7th ed., 1907; Eng. trans., W.
