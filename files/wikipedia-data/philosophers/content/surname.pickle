Bach]] as example. J. S. Bach shared his given name with six immediate family members and many extended family members. He shared his family name with most family members.]]\u000aA '''surname''' or '''family name''' is a name added to a [[given name]]. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many [[dictionaries]] define "surname" as a [[synonym]] of "family name". In the [[Western Hemisphere]], it is commonly synonymous with '''last name''' because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name.\u000a\u000aIn most [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] and [[Lusophone|Portuguese-speaking]] countries, two or more last names (or surnames) may be used. In [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Hungary]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]], and parts of [[India]], the family name is placed ''before'' a person's given name.\u000a\u000aThe concept of a "surname" is a relatively recent historical development, evolving from a medieval naming practice called a "[[byname]]". Based on an individual's occupation or area of residence, a byname would be used in situations where more than one person had the same name.\u000a\u000aA family name is typically a part of a person's [[personal name]] which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is [[#History|far from universal]]. In many countries, it is common for ordinary people to have only one name or [[mononym]], with some cultures not using family names. Also, in most [[Slavic countries]] and in [[Greece]], for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name.\u000a\u000a[[Surname law]]s vary around the world. Traditionally in many European countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would on marriage use the surname of her husband and that children of a man would have the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the [[putative father]] denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom and law in many countries.<ref>See, for example, the Italian Civil Code, art. 143-bis.</ref> The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father.<ref>Kelly, 99 W Va L Rev at 10; see id. at 10 n 25 (The custom of taking the father's surname assumes that the child is born to parents in a "state-sanctioned marriage." The custom is different for children born to unmarried parents.). Cited in [http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/A127262.htm#N_15_ Doherty v. Wizner, Oregon Court of Appeals] (2005)</ref> In recent years there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names with women not being automatically required or expected, some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, ''family name'' and ''surname'' both mean the [[patrilineal]] (literally, father-line) surname, handed down from or inherited from the father's line or [[patriline]], unless explicitly stated otherwise.  Thus, the term "maternal surname" means the ''patrilineal'' surname which one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of ''[[matrilineal]]'' ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see [[matrilineal surname]].\u000a\u000aIn English-speaking cultures, family names are often used by children when referring to adults, but it's also used to refer to someone in authority, the elderly, or in a formal setting, and are often used with a [[title]] or [[honorific]] such as [[Mr.]], [[Mrs.]], [[Ms.]], [[Miss]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], and so on. Generally the [[given name]], first name, forename, or personal name is the one used by friends, family, and other intimates to address an individual. It may also be used by someone who is in some way senior to the person being addressed. This practice also differs between cultures; see [[T\u2013V distinction]].\u000a\u000a==Research on individual names==\u000aThe study of proper names in family names is called [[onomastics]]. A [[one-name study]] is a collection of vital and other biographical data about all persons worldwide sharing a particular surname.\u000a\u000a==Order of names==\u000a{{further|Personal name#Name order}}\u000aIn many cultures (particularly in [[Culture of Europe|European]] and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as the Middle East, South Asia, and most African cultures), the surname or family name ("last name") is placed after the personal or given name ("first name"). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the [[Name order|Eastern order]] because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the [[East Asian cultural sphere]], specifically [[Japanese name|Japan]], [[Chinese name|China and Taiwan]], [[Korean name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]]. This is also the case in [[Hungarian names|Hungary]], parts of [[Romania]], [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Albanian name|Albania and Kosovo]], [[South India]], [[Sri Lanka]],<ref>[http://asiarecipe.com/srinames.html "Names in Sri Lanka"]</ref> and [[Madagascar]].\u000a\u000aSince family names are normally written last in European societies (except in Hungary), the term '''last name''' is commonly used for ''family name'', while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as '''upper name''' ({{Nihongo||\u4e0a\u306e\u540d\u524d|ue-no-namae}}).\u000a\u000aWhen those from Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong write their personal name in the [[Latin alphabet]], it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also [[Norm (social)|customary]] for the [[Baltic Finns|Baltic Fennic peoples]] and the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], but other [[Uralic languages|Uralic peoples]] traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the [[clan]] structure of their societies. Surnames have been imposed by the dominant authorities:{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} evangelists, then administrations. Thus, the [[Samis]] saw no change or a transformation of their name. For example: some '''Sire''' became '''Siri''',<ref>[http://snl.no/Aslak_Jacobsen_H%C3%A6tta Guttorm]</ref> '''Hætta Jáhko\u0161 Ásslat''' became '''[[Aslak Hætta|Aslak Jacobsen Hætta]]''' \u2014 as was the [[Convention (norm)|norm]]. Recently, integration into the [[European Union|EU]] and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname.\u000a\u000aIndian surnames may often denote [[caste]], profession, and village and are invariably mentioned along with the personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for [[collation]]. In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where it exists. In south India, surname is placed before personal name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\u000a\u000aIn English and other languages like Spanish\u2014although the usual order of names is "first middle last"\u2014for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to "last, first middle," with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name.<ref>[http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet27 "Filing Rules"] on the [[American Library Association]] website</ref><ref>[http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/05/ "MLA Works Cited Page: Basic Format"] on the [[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] website, [[Purdue University]]</ref> In [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]], administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\u000a\u000a==Compound surnames==\u000a{{main|Double-barrelled name}}\u000aWhile surnames are usually one word, in some cases a surname comprises more than one word.\u000a\u000a===Spanish compound surnames===\u000a{{main|Spanish naming customs}}\u000a{{further|Double-barrelled name#Spanish tradition}}\u000aIn most Spanish-speaking countries, the custom is for people to have two surnames. For instance, Spanish ex-premier [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] has [[José]] [[Luis]] as his given name, [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodríguez]], as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and [[Zapatero (surname)|Zapatero]] as his second (i.e. maternal) surname.\u000a\u000aThis custom is not seen in the Hispanic world as being a true compound surname system per se, since it is widely understood that the first surname denotes one's father's family, and the second surname denotes one's mother's family. So "Rodríguez Zapatero" is not considered one surname; it is two distinct surnames. Given that it is not a true compound surname, his children do not inherit the "compound" surname "Rodríguez Zapatero." Only the paternal surname of both father and mother are passed on. The father's paternal surname becomes the child's own paternal surname, while the mother's paternal surname becomes the child's second surname (as the child's own maternal surname). Thus, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero would pass on only Rodríguez to his children as their first (i.e. paternal) surname.\u000a\u000a====True compound surnames====\u000aBeyond this seemingly "compound" surname system in the Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the [[Military junta|Supreme Military Junta]] of [[Ecuador]], General [[Luis Telmo Paz y Miño|Luis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella]], has [[Luis]] as his first given name, [[Telmo]] as his middle name, the true compound surname [[Pazmiño|Paz y Miño]] as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and [[Estrella (disambiguation)|Estrella]] as his second (i.e. maternal) surname.\u000a\u000aLuis Telmo Paz y Miño Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Miño, Telmo Paz y Miño, or Luis Telmo Paz y Miño. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because "Paz" alone is not his surname (although other people use the "Paz" surname on its own).\u000a\u000aIn this case, [[Pazmiño|Paz y Miño]] is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname "Paz y Miño" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). "Paz" alone would not be passed on, nor would "Miño" alone.\u000a\u000aTo avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Miño. This is true especially in the [[Anglosphere]], but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since to many Hispanics unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, "Paz y Miño" might be inadvertently mistaken as "Paz" for the paternal surname and "Miño" for the maternal surname. Although Miño did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound.\u000a\u000aOther surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname [[Pazmiño]], whose members are related to the Paz y Miño, as both descend from the "Paz Miño" family of five centuries ago.\u000a\u000a====Álava compound surnames====\u000a[[Álava]], Spain is notorious for its incidence of true compound surnames, known as "apellido compuesto alavés" (Álava compound surname).\u000a\u000aUnlike other true compound surnames, which resulted from the merging of a previously paternal and maternal surname, the Álava compound surname is characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the [[Castilian language]]) or more unusually a [[Basque language]] patronymic, followed by the [[preposition]] "de", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from Álava. While this form of compound surname can be found in other regions of Spain, albeit scarcely, it is only in Álava that it has persisted. These type of customary compound surnames used to be found throughout [[Guipúzcoa]], [[Navarra]], [[Soria]], [[Logroño]], and most of [[Green Spain]] generally (i.e. the Spanish northern maritime façade exposed to the Atlantic Ocean which runs along the coastal strip lying north of the Cantabrian and Basque mountains, along the Bay of Biscay.)\u000a\u000a===English compound surnames===\u000a{{further|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}\u000aCompound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a [[hyphen]] or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example [[Iain Duncan Smith]], a former leader of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], whose surname is "Duncan Smith". A surname with the prefix "Fitz" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in "Fitz William", as well as "FitzWilliam" or "Fitzwilliam".\u000a\u000a===Irish compound surnames===\u000aIrish surnames are the oldest surnames in Europe. The common prefixes "Ó" and "Mac" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding "Ó Briain" or "Mac Millan" as well as the anglicized "O'Brien" and "MacMillan" or "Macmillan."\u000a\u000a==History==\u000aWhile given names have been used from the most distant times to identify individuals, the advent of surnames is a relatively recent phenomenon.<ref name=Doll1992>{{Cite news|last=Doll|first=Cynthia Blevins|publication-date=|date=|year=1992|title=Harmonizing Filial and Parental Rights in Names: Progress, Pitfalls, and Constitutional Problems|periodical=Howard Law Journal|publisher=Howard University School of Law|volume=35|issue=|page=227|url=|issn=0018-6813}} ''Note: content available by subscription only.

For example, [[Alexander the Great]] was known as [[Heracleidae|''Heracleides'']] (as a supposed descendant of [[Heracles]]) and by the dynastic name [[Caranus of Macedon|''Karanos''/''Caranus'']], which referred to the founder of the [[Argead dynasty|dynasty to which he belonged]]. In none of these cases, though, were these names considered essential parts of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today.\u000a\u000aIn the Roman Empire, the bestowal and use of clan and family names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (''See [[Roman naming conventions]].'') The nomen, which was the gens name, was inherited much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different.  In later Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals.  The nomen were to identify group kinship.  The praenomen was literally the "forename" and was originally used like a first name today.  In later times, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing invidiuals as it was often passed down for boys along with the nomen (like an entire culture where "John Smith, Jr." was the norm), and girls, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor ("Older" and "Younger") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino ("Biggest," "Middle," "Littlest") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time, the nomen became followed by one or more additional names called cognomen.  It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became ever more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, to the point that the first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely.  With the gradual influence of Greek/Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names.<ref name=Chavez2006>{{cite web\u000a |url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/names/byzantine/introduction.html\u000a |title= Personal Names of the Aristocracy in the Roman Empire During the Later Byzantine Era\u000a |accessdate=2008-09-21 |last=Chavez |first=Berret |date=2006-11-09 |work=Official Web Page of the Laurel Sovereign of Arms for the Society for Creative Anachronism\u000a |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism\u000a}}</ref> By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames.

Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and only slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. But some early Norman nobles in England chose to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings.\u000a\u000aSurnames were uncommon prior to the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common, for example on the [[Isle of Lewis]] in [[Scotland]], many residents have the family name MacLeod (son of Lewis) and so may still be known by a surname symbolising their occupation such as 'Kevin the post' and 'Kevin Handbag'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\u000a\u000aIn the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the [[testator]] continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among [[matrilineal]] [[First Nations|Canadian aboriginal]] groups, such as the [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Gitxsan]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}; it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a [[double-barrelled name]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

A spouse may also opt to use his or her birth name as a middle name.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} An additional option, although rarely practiced{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as "Simones", which also requires a legal name change.

The Age.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn medieval [[Spain]], a patronymic system was used.  For example, ''Álvaro'', the son of ''Rodrigo'' would be named ''Álvaro Rodríguez''.  His son, ''Juan'', would not be named ''Juan Rodríguez'', but ''Juan Álvarez''. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world.  Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. ''Delgado'' ("thin") and ''Moreno'' ([[polysemous]] word, it can mean "brown skinned", "dark skinned", "tanned skinned", "brunette hair" or "black hair"); occupations, e.g. ''Molinero'' ("miller"), ''Zapatero'' ("Shoe-maker") and ''Guerrero'' ("warrior"); and geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. ''Alemán'' ("German").\u000a\u000a===Modern era===\u000aDuring the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Notable examples include the Netherlands (1811),{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Japan (1870s),{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Thailand (1920),{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and Turkey (1934).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Tibetans, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\u000a\u000aFamily names sometimes change or are replaced by non-family-name surnames under political pressure to avoid persecution.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Examples are the cases with [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesians]] and [[Chinese Thai surname|Chinese Thais]] after migration there during the 20th century, or the [[Jew]]s who fled to different European countries to avoid persecution from the Nazis during World War II.\u000a\u000aThe United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent times.

English speakers' surnames come from  all parts of Europe, as well as other continents, with varying [[anglicisation of names|anglicization]]. With a few exceptions, Europe's languages are [[cognate]], so most European surnames have a common [[etymological]] origin. Some surnames are ''monogenetic'' (derived from one family at a specific place and time); others are ''polygenetic'' (coined independently at different places and times).<ref name=hanks/>\u000a\u000aBasil Cottle classifies European surnames under just four broad categories, depending on their origin:  given name (patronymics), occupational name, local name (toponymics), and nickname.<ref name=cottle>Cottle, Basil.

A person's last name indicates the first name of his or her father ([[patronymic]]) or in some cases mother ([[matronymic]]). Many common family names in other Scandinavian countries are a result of this naming practice, such as [[Hansen (surname)|Hansen]] (son of [[Hans (name)|Hans]]), [[Johansen]] (son of [[Johan (given name)|Johan]]) and [[Olsen (surname)|Olsen]] (son of [[Ole (name)|Ole]]/[[Ola (disambiguation)|Ola]]), the three most common surnames in [[Norway]].<ref>Statistics Norway [http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/navn_en/ name statistics, 2009]</ref> This also occurs in other cultures: Spanish and Portuguese (López or Lopes, son of Lopo; Álvarez or Álvares, son of Álvaro; Domínguez or Domingues, son of Domingo or Domingos; etc.); in English (Johnson, son of John; Richardson, son of Richard), etc.\u000a\u000aPatronymic name conventions are similar in some other nations, including Malaysia (see [[Malaysian name]]) and other Muslim countries, among most people of the Indian states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] (unlike another Indian state [[Andhra Pradesh]], where ancestral origin village names have become surnames for the people), in [[Mongolian name|Mongolia]] and in the [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]. In [[Russian name|Russia]] and [[Bulgarian name|Bulgaria]], both patronymic and family name are obligatory parts of one's full name: e.g. if a Russian is called Ivan Andreyevich Sergeyev, that means that his father's name is Andrey and his family name is Sergeyev. A similar system is used in [[Greek names|Greece]].\u000a\u000aIn [[Habesha name|Ethiopia and Eritrea]], a child adopts the given name of one of their parents, usually the father, as a pseudo-surname. For example, Abraham Mesfin's father's ''first'' name would have been Mesfin, while Abraham Mesfin's child might be called "Nestanet Abraham." Just as in Iceland, referring to Abraham Mesfin as "Mr Mesfin" would be erroneous: the correct term would be "Mr Abraham." Very rarely do children adopt their mother's given name, who in any case would retain their "pseudo-surname".\u000a\u000aAs part of [[Patronymic#Jewish usage|Hebrew patronymic names]], [[Ben (Hebrew)|Ben]] is followed by the father's name, e.g. [[Ben Adam|ben adam]] ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd}}) or [[Abraham ben Abraham]]. [[Bar (Aramaic)#Aramaic|Bar-]], "son of" in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], is used likewise, e.g. [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]. Ben ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df}}, ''son of'') also forms part of [[Hebrew name]]s, e.g. [[Benjamin]].\u000a* '''[[Patronymic]]s, [[matronymic]]s or ancestral''', often from a person's given name. e.g., from male name: ''[[Richardson (surname)|Richardson]]'', ''[[Stephenson]]'', ''[[Jones (surname)|Jones]]'' (Welsh for John), ''[[Williams (surname)|Williams]]'', ''[[Jackson (name)|Jackson]]'', ''[[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]'', ''[[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]'', ''[[Benson (surname)|Benson]]'', ''[[Johnson]]'', ''[[Harris (surname)|Harris]]'', ''[[Evans (surname)|Evans]]'', ''[[Simpson (surname)|Simpson]]'', ''[[Willis (surname)|Willis]]'', ''[[Fox (surname)|Fox]]'', ''[[Davies]]'', ''[[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]]'', ''[[Adams (surname)|Adams]]'', ''[[Dawson (surname)|Dawson]]'', ''[[Lewis (surname)|Lewis]]'', ''[[Rogers (surname)|Rogers]]'', ''[[Murphy]]'', ''[[Morrow (surname)|Morrow]]'', ''[[Nicholson (surname)|Nicholson]]'', ''[[Robinson (name)|Robinson]]'', ''[[Powell (surname)|Powell]]'', ''[[Ferguson (name)|Ferguson]]'', ''[[Davis (surname)|Davis]]'', ''[[Edwards (surname)|Edwards]]'', ''[[Hudson (surname)|Hudson]]'', ''[[Roberts (surname)|Roberts]]'', ''[[Harrison (name)|Harrison]]'', ''[[Watson (surname)|Watson]]'', or female names ''Molson'' (from Moll for Mary), ''[[Madison (name)|Madison]]'' (from Maud), ''Emmott'' (from Emma), ''Marriott'' (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g., ''[[MacDonald]]'', ''[[Clan Forbes|Forbes]]'', ''[[Henderson (surname)|Henderson]]'', ''[[Armstrong (surname)|Armstrong]]'', ''[[Grant (surname)|Grant]]'', ''[[Cameron (surname)|Cameron]]'', ''[[Stewart (name)|Stewart]]'', ''[[Douglas (surname)|Douglas]]'', ''[[Crawford (name)|Crawford]]'', ''[[Campbell (surname)|Campbell]]'', ''[[Hunter (name)|Hunter]]'') with "Mac" [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] for son.<ref>Katherine M.

(Kil may come from the Gaelic word 'Cill' which means Church. This would certainly support the claim that the surname is tied to the religion.)\u000a\u000aThere is a wide range of [[family name affixes]] with a patronymic function. Some are prefixes (e.g., Gaelic ''mac'') but more are suffixes.\u000a\u000a===Occupational surname=== <!-- [[Occupational name]] and [[Occupational surname]] redirects here -->\u000a[[Vocation|Occupational]] names include such simple examples as ''[[Smith (surname)|Smith]]'' (for a [[metalsmith|smith]]), ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'' (for a [[miller]]), ''[[Farmer (surname)|Farmer]]'' (for farm tax collectors or sometimes [[farmer]]s), ''[[Thatcher (profession)|Thatcher]]'' (for a [[thatching|thatcher]]), ''[[Shepherd (surname)|Shepherd]]'' (for a [[shepherd]]), ''[[Potter (surname)|Potter]]'' (for a [[pottery|potter]]), and so on, as well as non-English ones, such as the German ''Eisenhauer'' (iron [[hewer]], later Anglicized in America as ''[[Eisenhower (name)|Eisenhower]]'') or ''[[Schneider (surname)|Schneider]]'' (tailor) - or indeed, as in English, ''[[Schmidt (surname)|Schmidt]]'' (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter ''s'' to the word, although this formation could also be a [[patronymic]]. For instance, the surname ''[[Vickers (surname)|Vickers]]'' is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar,<ref name=reaney>Reaney, P.H., and Wilson, R.M.

ISBN 0-19-860092-5.</ref> while ''[[Roberts (surname)|Roberts]]'' could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval [[Mystery play#English mystery plays|mystery plays]]. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include ''[[King (surname)|King]]'', ''[[Lord (surname)|Lord]]'', ''Virgin'', and ''Death'';<ref name=bowman>Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''.

Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of [[Old English]] elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element ''t\u016bn'' may have originally meant "enclosure" in one name, but can have meant "farmstead", "village", "manor", or "estate" in other names.\u000a\u000aLocation names, or habitation names, may be as generic as "Monte" (Portuguese for "mountain"), "Górski" (Polish for "hill") or "Pitt" (variant of "pit"), but may also refer to specific locations. "Washington," for instance, is thought to mean "the homestead of the family of Wassa,"<ref name=cottle/> while "Lucci" likely means "resident of [[Lucca]]."<ref name=hanks/> Although some surnames, such as "London," "Lisboa" or "Bialystok" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in [[Ó Creachmhaoil]], derived from a village in [[County Galway]]. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.<ref name="bowman"/><ref name="cottle"/>\u000a\u000aIn [[Portuguese-speaking countries]], it is not uncommon to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, França, Brasil, Holanda.\u000a\u000aMany [[Japanese name|Japanese surnames]] derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (\u77f3\u5ddd) means "stone river", Yamamoto (\u5c71\u672c) means "the base of the mountain", and Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) means "above the well."\u000a\u000aArabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin.

These include names, also known as eke-names,<ref>[http://www.houseofnames.com/Claro+-family-crest "Claro Family Crest and History"] on the ''House of Names'' website</ref> based on appearance such as "Schwartzkopf," "Short," and possibly "Caesar,"<ref name=hanks/> and names based on temperament and personality such as "Daft," "Gutman," and "Maiden," which, according to a number of sources, was an English nickname meaning "effeminate."<ref name="cottle"/><ref name="hanks"/> When Jewish families in Central Europe were forced to adopt surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries, those who failed to choose a surname were often given pejorative or even cruel nicknames (such as "Schweinmann" ("pig man") or "Schmutz" (a variant of "filthy")) by the local registrar.<ref name=bowman/> Many families later changed these names.\u000a* '''Personal characteristics''' e.g., ''Short'', ''[[Brown (surname)|Brown]]'', ''Black'', ''Whitehead'', ''[[Young (surname)|Young]]'', ''Long'', ''[[White (surname)|White]]''\u000a\u000a====Ornamental surname====<!-- [[Ornamental name]] redirects here -->\u000aOrnamental names used as surnames are more common in communities which adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name=bowman/> They occur commonly among Jewish families and in Scandinavia.<ref name=hanks/> Examples include "[[Morgenstern (disambiguation)|Morgenstern]]" ("morning star"), "[[Safire (disambiguation)|Safire]]" ("sapphire"), and "Reis" ("branch"). In some cases, such as [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesians]] and [[Thai Chinese#Surnames|Chinese Thais]], certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (\u6797\u7ecd\u826f) "indonesianised" his name to [[Sudono Salim]]. In this case "Liem" (\u6797) was rendered by "Salim", a name of Arabic origin, while "Sudono", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix "su-" (of Sanskrit origin), was supposed{{by whom?|date=January 2016}} to be a rendering of "Swie Liong".  During the era of the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] (of Africans) many Africans lost their native names and were forced{{by whom?|date=January 2016}} to take the surnames of their slave masters and any given name the slave master desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (''i.e.'' [[slave name]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\u000a\u000a===Gender-specific versions of surname===\u000aIn some cultures, such as Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc. surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer. For example, in Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take the father's surname), since that name has a female version. In [[Poland]], if the husband is named Podwi\u0144ski, and his wife takes his surname, her last name, and those of their unmarried daughters, would be Podwi\u0144ska. The sons would be known as Podwi\u0144ski. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkien\u0117 and his daughter will be named Vilkait\u0117. In Slovakia and Czech Republic alike, if a man is called Novák, the wife adds a feminine suffix "-ová" to his surname after the marriage, hence Nováková. The same is true for daughters which almost always inherit the father's surname with the feminine suffix.\u000a\u000a===Other===\u000aThe meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the Irish name "[[Ryan (surname)|Ryan]]", which means ''little king'' in Irish Gaelic.<ref name=cottle/><ref name=reaney/> Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name "De Luca," for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius;<ref name=hanks/> in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration.<ref name=hanks/> The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname ''[[Lee (English name)|Lee]]'' is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname ''[[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]]''.<ref name=reaney/> Surname origins have been the subject of much [[folk etymology]].\u000a\u000aIn [[French Canada]] until the 19th century, several families adopted surnames that followed the family name in order to distinguish the various branches of a large family. Such a surname was preceded by the word "dit" ("said") and was known as a "nom-dit" ("said-name"). (Compare with some [[Roman naming conventions]].) While this tradition is no longer in use, in many cases the nom-dit has come to replace the original family name. Thus the Bourbeau family has split into Bourbeau dit Verville, Bourbeau dit Lacourse, and Bourbeau dit Beauchesne. In many cases Verville, Lacourse, or Beauchesne has become the new family name. Likewise, the Rivard family has split into the Rivard dit Lavigne, Rivard dit Loranger and Rivard dit Lanoie. The origin of the nom-dit can vary. Often it denoted a geographical trait of the area where that branch of the family lived: Verville lived towards the city, Beauchesne lived near an oak tree, Larivière near a river, etc. Some of the oldest noms-dits are derived from the war name of a settler who served in the army or militia: Tranchemontagne ("mountain slasher"), Jolic\u0153ur ("braveheart"). Others denote a personal trait: Lacourse might have been a fast runner, Legrand was probably tall, etc.\u000a\u000a== Culture and prevalence ==\u000a[[File:Power law surnames.jpg|thumb|450px|Rank and frequency of some US surnames]]\u000aIn the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith,<ref>[http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/dist.all.last Genealogy], U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division (1995).</ref> which is also the most frequent English name and an occupational name ("metal worker"), a contraction, for instance, of [[blacksmith]] or other [[metalsmith]]s. Several American surnames are a result of corruptions or phonetic misappropriations of European surnames, perhaps as a result of the registration process at the immigration entry points. Spellings and pronunciations of names remained fluid in the United States until the Social Security System enforced standardization.\u000a\u000aApproximately 70% of Canadians have surnames that are of English, Irish, French, or Scottish derivation.\u000a\u000aAccording to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames.

April 20, 2009.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Spanish-speaking world==\u000a{{main articles|Spanish naming customs|Naming customs of Hispanic America}}\u000aIn [[Spain]] and in most [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]], the custom is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from the father and the second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if "(José) GARCÍA Torres" and "(María) ACOSTA Gómez" had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.\u000a\u000aIn some instances, when an individual's given name and first family name are too common (such as in [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]), both family names are used (though not necessarily both given names). A person could even take the maternal name for informal situations instead of the paternal name, for personal preferences or if the maternal name is somehow "special" (José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero is known in Spanish as "José Luis Zapatero" or just as "Zapatero"). In Spain, a new law approved in 1999 allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree.<ref>{{cite web\u000a |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/rd193-2000.html\u000a |title=Real Decreto 193/2000, de 11 de febrero, de modificación de determinados artículos del Reglamento del Registro Civil en materia relativa al nombre y apellidos y orden de los mismos.\u000a |accessdate=2008-09-22 |author=Juan Carlos R. |date=2000-02-11 |work=Base de Datos de Legislación |publisher=Noticias Juridicas\u000a |language = Spanish |archiveurl =  |archivedate =  |quote =\u000a}} ''Note: Google auto translation of title into English\u2192Royal Decree 193/2000, of February 11, to amend certain articles of the Civil Registration Regulations in the field on the name and order.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn Spain, especially [[Catalonia]], the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction ''y'' ("and" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or ''i'' ("and" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), see for example the economist [[Xavier Sala-i-Martin]] or painter [[Salvador Dalí|Salvador Dalí i Domènech]].\u000a\u000aIn Spain, a woman does not change her legal surnames when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in [[Latin America]], a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition ''de'' ("of"), ''del'' ("of the", when the following word is masculine) or ''de la'' ("of the", when the following word is feminine). For example, if "Clara Reyes Alba" were to marry "Alberto Gómez Rodríguez", the wife could use "Clara Reyes ''de'' Gómez" as her name (or "Clara Reyes Gómez", or, rarely, "Clara Gómez Reyes". She can be addressed as ''[[Mrs.|Sra]]. de Gómez'' corresponding to "Mrs Gómez"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom of adding the husband's surname is slowly fading.\u000a\u000aSometimes a father transmits his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of ''Javier'' (given name) ''Reyes'' (paternal family name) ''de la Barrera'' (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname ''Reyes de la Barrera''. ''De'' is also the [[nobiliary particle]] used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example "Puente" and "Del Puente" are not the same surname.\u000a\u000aChildren take the surnames of both parents, so if the couple above had two children named "Andrés" and "Ana", then their names would be "Andrés Gómez Reyes" and "Ana Gómez Reyes". In [[Spain]], a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be either "Andrés Gómez Reyes" or "Andrés Reyes Gómez".<ref>[http://noticias.juridicas.com/index.php?doc=http%3A//noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/lrc.html ''Art. 55 Ley de Registro Civil'' \u2013 Civil Register Law] (article in Spanish)</ref> Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, "Ana Reyes Reyes". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated.\u000a\u000aIt should be noted that some Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Dropping the paternal surname is not unusual when it is a very common one. For instance, painter Pablo Ruiz [[Picasso]] and Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] are known by their maternal surnames as "Picasso" and "Zapatero". Similarly, Anglophones with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated.\u000a\u000aTraditionally in most countries, and currently in some Spanish-speaking countries, women, upon marrying, keep their own family names. It is considered impolite towards her family for a woman to change her name. The higher class women of [[Cuba]] and Spain traditionally never change their names.  In certain rare situations, a woman may be addressed with her paternal surname followed by her husband's paternal surname linked with ''de''. For example, a woman named ''Ana García Díaz'', upon marrying ''Juan Guerrero Macías'', could be called ''Ana García de Guerrero''. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} in [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Peru]], [[Panama]], and to a certain extent in [[Mexico]] (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere.  In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if ''Rosa María Pérez Martínez'' marries ''Juan Martín De la Cruz Gómez'', she will be called ''Rosa María Pérez Martínez de De la Cruz'', and if the husband dies, she will be called ''Rosa María Pérez Martínez Vda. de De la Cruz'' (Vda. being the abbreviation for ''viuda'', "widow" in Spanish).  The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration.\u000a\u000aIn some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as legal marriage, the wife is referred to as "''hermana''" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well.\u000a\u000aA new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.\u000a\u000aIn Spanish villages in Catalonia, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Asturias]] and in Cuba, people are often known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as "Remei de Ca l'Elvira"; and Adela Barreira López who is part of the "Provisores" family would be known as "Adela dos Provisores".\u000a\u000a{{see also|Surnames by country#The Philippines}}\u000a\u000a==Portuguese-speaking countries==\u000a{{main article|Portuguese name}}\u000a\u000aIn the case of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alphasorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last.\u000a\u000aEach person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames \u2014 he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bearing that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil there is no limit of surnames used.\u000a\u000aIn general, the traditions followed in countries like [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]] and [[Angola]] are somewhat different from the ones in Spain. In the Spanish tradition, usually the father's surname comes first, followed by the mother's surname, whereas in Portuguese-speaking countries the father's name is the last, mother's coming first.  A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless she usually keeps her birth names, or at least the last one. Since 1977, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage.\u000a\u000aThe custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\u000a\u000aFor the children, some bear only the last surnames of the parents. For example, ''Carlos da Silva Gonçalves'' and ''Ana Luísa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gonçalves)'' (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named ''Lucas Pereira Gonçalves''.  However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to [[euphony]], social significance or other reasons.\u000a\u000aIn ancient times a patronymic was commonly used \u2014 surnames like ''Gonçalves'' ("son of ''Gonçalo''"), ''Fernandes'' ("son of ''Fernando''"), ''Nunes'' ("son of ''Nuno''"), ''Soares'' ("son of ''Soeiro''"), ''Sanches'' ("son of ''Sancho''"), ''Henriques'' ("son of ''Henrique''"), ''Rodrigues'' ("son of ''Rodrigo''") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names.\u000a\u000aIn Medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. [[Soeiro Mendes da Maia]] bore a name "Soeiro", a patronymic "Mendes" ("son of Hermenegildo \u2013 shortened to Mendo") and the name of the town he ruled "[[Maia, Porto, Portugal|Maia]]". He was often referred to in 12th century documents as "Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surname. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will.\u000a\u000aOnly during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal.\u000a\u000aUntil the end of the 19th century it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.\u000aDuring the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France.\u000a\u000aFrom the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%).<ref>http://lifestyle.publico.pt/artigos/341672_identidade-submissao-ou-amor-o-que-significa-adoptar-o-apelido-do-marido</ref> Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife's surname(s), but this practice is rare.\u000a\u000a[[Brazilians]] usually call people only by their given names, omitting family names, even in many formal situations, as in the press referring to authorities, e.g. "Former President Fernando Henrique", never Former President Cardoso, or even "Former President Lula" ("Lula" was actually his [[nickname]]). When formality or a prefix requires a family name, the given name usually precedes the surname, e.g. ''João Santos'', or ''Sr. João Santos''.\u000a\u000a==By ethnic group==\u000a\u000a===Jewish===\u000a{{Main|Jewish name}}\u000a\u000a[[Jewish]] names have historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions. The most usual last name for those of the [[Kohanim|priest tribe]] is "Cohen"/"Kahen"/"Kogan"/"Kohen"/"Katz" (a Hebrew [[acronym]] of Kohen Tzedek, or righteous Kohen) and for those of the [[Levite]]s, "Levi"/"Levine". Those who came from Europe usually have "Rosen"("rose"), "Spiel", "Gold", and other German words as their names' prefixes, and "man", "wyn"/"wein"("wine"), "berg"("mountain"), and other German words as their names' suffixes. Most [[Sephardic Jew]]s adopted [[Arabic]] names, like "Azizi" ("you're [someones] love"), "[[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]]" or added words to their original names, like "Kohenzadeh" ("[she] bore a Kohen"). Names like "Johnson" and "Peterson" may be used in Jewish tradition as they too used the father's name as identification. So "Johnson" in Hebrew is "Ben Yochanon", meaning "Yochanon (John)'s son". Many Yemenite Jews' family names are consisting of the place in which their ancestors have come to Yemen (like [[Sana'a]]) and an "i" in the end (like the family name "San'ani"), indicating belonging to the place they have originated from.\u000a\u000a===Assyrian===\u000aThe Assyrians (a.k.a. [[Chaldo-Assyrian]]) are a distinct ethnic group, descendant largely from the population of ancient [[Assyria]], indigenous to [[Mesopotamia]] with deep and long roots in the Middle East, mainly present-day [[Iraq]], northwest [[Iran]], northeast [[Syria]] and southeast [[Turkey]].\u000a\u000aSurnames come from the [[Akkadian]] influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] dialects of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] ([[Chaldo-Assyrian]]) people. Some surnames are connected to [[East Syrian Rite]] [[Christianity]], the religion Assyrians currently follow and have followed since the 1st Century AD, with others being of distinctly ancient Assyrian/Mesopotamian origin.\u000a\u000aCommon surnames include: ''Aboona'', ''Abraham'', ''Abro'', ''Agajan'', ''Agassi'', ''Aghase'', ''Akkad'', ''Akbalit/Akbalut'',  ''Alamasha'', ''Alawerdy'', ''Aldawid'', ''Amo Baba'', ''Amu'', ''Antar'', ''Aprim'', ''Apshu'',  ''Afarcan'', ''Arad'', ''Ashai'', ''Ashouri'', ''Ashurian'', ''Ashur'', ''Awdishu'', ''Awikam'',  ''Awishalim'', ''Awitor'', ''Awia'', ''Awrohum'',  ''Aziz'', ''Azzo'', ''Baba'', ''Bacchus'', ''Badel'', ''Barkha/Barkho'', ''Brikha'',  ''Bronit'',  ''Balou'', ''Barkoo'', ''Benassi'', ''Benyamin'', ''Bidavid'', ''Bidawid'', ''Bishu'', ''Cabani'', ''Dadashu/Dadasho'',  ''Darmu'',  ''Dinkha'', ''Daoud'', ''Dayan/Daian'',  ''Disho'', ''Duman'', ''Elia'', ''Elias'', ''Enwia'', ''Eshai'', ''Farhad'', ''Gorges/Georgis'', ''Gewargis'', ''Hadad/Adad'', ''Hamsho'',  ''Hasso'', ''Harshu'', ''Hormis'', ''Hosanna'', ''Hurmis'', ''Ilshu'', ''Ilishu'', ''Ishmael'', ''Ishai'',  ''Isaac'', ''Ishaq'', ''Iskhaq'', ''Iwassi'', ''Jabri'', ''Jelu'', ''Jendo'', ''Juna'', ''Kambar'',  ''Karam'', ''Karoukian'', ''Kasri'',  ''Khamo'', ''Khanbaba'', ''Khanisho/Khnanisu'', ''Khnaninia'',  ''Khedroo'', ''Khoshanu'', ''Khoshaba'', ''Malech'', ''Malek'', ''Malka'', ''Malkai'', ''Malick'', ''Mamendo'', ''Matti'', ''Merza'', ''Mikhael/Mikhail'', ''Mnashi'', ''Nisan'', ''Nimrod'', ''Narsai'', ''Ninweh'', ''Nineveh'', ''Nessar'',  ''Odah'', ''Odisha'', ''Odisho'', ''Oraham'', ''Oshana'', ''Qateneh'', ''Raaba'',  ''Rabi'', ''Rafael'', ''Ramsin/Rumsin'', ''Rassam'', ''Rifkha'',  ''Ronay'', ''Samo'', ''Sargis'', ''Sargon'', ''Sarkis'', ''Sarmas'', ''Sayad'', ''Semma'', ''Shabad'', ''Shamash/Shamasha'', ''Shamshi'', ''Sinharib'', ''Sharrukin'', ''Shimun'', ''Shamoon'', ''Shimon'', ''Shimonaya'', ''Shinu'', ''Shinai'', ''Sleman'', ''Shulman'', ''Sliwoo/Sliwa'', ''Tematheus'', ''Thoma'', ''Thomaya'', ''Tamraz'', ''Tiras'', ''Tiyareh/Tyareh'', ''Urshan'', ''Warda'', ''Warad'', ''Yacoub'', ''Yawalaha'', ''Yalda'', ''Yatrin'', ''Yetron'',  ''Yelu'', ''Yoel'', ''Yohannan'', ''Yonan'', ''Yonadam'' ''Yoseph'', ''Yoshu'',  ''Youkhana'', ''Younan'', ''Yousif'', ''Yukhannan'', ''Zakharia'', ''Zilkha'',  ''Zimri''.\u000a\u000a===Kurdish===\u000aThe majority of Kurds do not hold Kurdish names because the names have been banned in the countries they primarily live in (namely Iran, Turkey and Syria). Kurds in these respective countries tend to hold Turkish, Persian or Arabic names, in the majority of cases, forcefully appointed by the ruling governments.<ref>{{cite speech\u000a | title = (Requests to Syrian government regarding restoration of rights to Kurds residing in Syria)\u000a | first = Jian | last = Badrakhan | date = August 2006 | accessdate = 2008-07-20\u000a | location = United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (Session 58), Working Group on Minorities (Session 12)\u000a | url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/minorities/docs/12/YASA_Kurdish_Centre_for_Legal_Studies_Consultancy.doc\u000a}}</ref>  Others hold Arabic names as a result of the influence of Islam and Arab culture.\u000a\u000aKurds holding authentic Kurdish names are generally found in Diaspora or in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] where Kurds are relatively free. Traditionally, Kurdish family names are inherited from the tribes of which the individual or families are members. However, some families inherit the names of the regions they are from.\u000a\u000aCommon affixes of authentic Kurdish names are "-î" and "-za" also "-a" and "-ê" by two surnames.<br>\u000ae.g.:<br>\u000a'''Name+1Surname+2Surname'''<br>\u000a''Male:''\u000a*Baran(ê) Memê Alan\u000aBaran of Mem of Alan\u000a\u000a''Female:'' \u000a*Berfîn(a) Soreya Evînê\u000aBerfin of Sarah of Evin\u000a<br>\u000athere are also names with the word "Mal(a)" [House (of)]\u000ae.g.: \u000a*Baran mala Alan\u000aBaran of House of Alan\u000a\u000a*Berfîn mala Evîn\u000aBerfin of House of Evin\u000a\u000aSome common Kurdish last names, which are also the names of their respective tribes, include Baradost, Barzani, Berwari, Berzinji, Chelki, Diri, Doski, Jaf, Mutki, Rami, Rekani, Rozaki, Sindi, and Tovi. Other names include Akreyi, Alan, Amedi, Botani, Hewrami, Mukri, and Serhati.\u000a\u000aTraditionally, Kurdish women did not inherit a man's last name. Although still not in practice by many Kurds, this can be more commonly found today.\u000a\u000a===Tibet===\u000aTibetan people are often named at birth by the local Buddhist Lama or they may request a name from the Dalai Lama. They do not often use a family name though many have one.  They may change their name throughout life if advised by a Buddhist Lama, for example if a different name removes obstacles. The Tibetans who enter monastic life take a name from their ordination Lama, which will be a combination of the Lama's name and a new name for them.\u000a\u000a===North Caucasian Adyghe===\u000aIn the case of [[Circassians]], especially [[Adyges]] and [[Kabardians]], hereditary surnames have been borne by people for thousands of years. All Circassian people belong to a Clan.\u000a\u000aMost surnames of Adyge origin fall into six types:\u000a* Occupations (e.g., 'smith', 'hunter', 'tailor')\u000a* Personal characteristics (e.g., 'short', 'deaf', 'beautiful')\u000a* Geographical features (e.g., 'hill', 'river', 'cave', 'wood', 'fields')\u000a* Animal names (e.g., 'bear', 'horse', 'snake', 'fox', 'wild boar')\u000a* Patronymics and ancestry, often from a male's given name ('son of...') or from an ethnic name (e.g., ''Shapsug'', ''Kabardey'')\u000a* Religious names (e.g., ''Shogen'' 'Priest', ''Yefendi'' 'Efendi', ''Mole'' 'Mullah')\u000a\u000a''Shogen'' comes from the Christian era, and ''Yefendi'' and ''Mole'' come from the Muslim era.\u000a\u000aCircassian women, even when they marry, do not change their surnames. By keeping their surnames and passing it on to the next generation, children come to distinguish relatives from the maternal side and respect her family as well as those from their father's side.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, children cannot marry someone who bears the same surname as they do, no matter how distantly related.\u000a\u000aIn the Circassian tradition, the formula for surnames is patterned to mean "daughter of ..."\u000a\u000aAbkhaz families follow similar naming patterns reflecting the common roots of the Abkhazian, Adygean and Wubikh peoples.\u000a\u000aCircassian family names cannot be derived from women's names or from the name of female ancestors.\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a{{div col|cols=3}}\u000a* [[Genealogy]]\u000a* [[Generation name]]\u000a* [[Given name]]\u000a* [[Legal name]]\u000a* [[List of family name affixes]]\u000a* [[Lists of most common surnames]]\u000a* [[Maiden and married names]]\u000a* [[Matriname]]\u000a* [[Name blending]]\u000a* [[Name change]]\u000a* [[Nobiliary particle]]\u000a* [[One-name study]]\u000a* [[Patronymic surname]]\u000a* [[Personal name]]\u000a* [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Surname extinction]]\u000a* [[Surname map]]\u000a* [[Surname law]]\u000a* [[Surnames by country]]\u000a* [[Naming law]]\u000a* [[T\u2013V distinction]]\u000a{{Div col end}}\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a'''Notes'''\u000a{{Reflist|2}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a* Bowman, William Dodgson.
