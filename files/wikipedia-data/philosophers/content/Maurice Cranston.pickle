He served for many years as Professor of Political Science at the [[London School of Economics]], and was also known for his popular publications. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was Professor of Political Theory at the [[European University Institute]] in Florence (Italy).\u000a\u000aHe was born at 53 Harringay Road, [[Harringay]]<ref name=rosen>F.

During the [[Second World War]], Cranston was a [[conscientious objector]], active in the [[Peace Pledge Union]],  \u000aand a "frequent contributor" to its newspaper ''[[Peace News]]''.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-maurice-cranston-1503237.html Obituary:Professor Maurice Cranston] Alan Eden-Green, ''The Independent'', 10 November 1993.

In 1946 two of his detective novels were published by John Westhouse: ''Tomorrow We'll Be Sober'' and ''Philosopher's Hemlock''.\u000a\u000aCranston's intellectual abilities were varied. His first academic book, ''Freedom: A New Analysis'' (1954), covered history (the history of liberalism), politics (a precursive discussion of what [[Sir Isaiah Berlin]] would later analyse as negative and positive liberty) and a philosophical attempt to resolve or at least elucidate freedom of the will. The philosophical section was the least successful; and Cranston never again attempted pure philosophy. His main academic strengths were as a biographer and as an intellectual historian.\u000a\u000aIn a controversial paper, Cranston argued that the scarcity of welfare goods and services meant that supposed welfare rights are not really rights at all.<ref>Cranston, Maurice. \u2018Human Rights: Real and Supposed,\u2019 in Political Theory and the Rights of Man, edited by D. D. Raphael (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1967), pp. 43-51</ref>\u000a\u000aIn his later years, Cranston moved to the political right, and expressed admiration for [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Seldon, Arthur. ''The virtues of capitalism''. Liberty Fund, 2004  ISBN 0-86597-550-7.  (p. 415)</ref> Cranston also contributed to ''The American Spectator'' magazine.\u000a\u000aCranston had a keen aesthetic sensibility. This was shown not only in his clothes but also in his elegant literary style. Elegance extended also to his conversation. At a party for politics students at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1965, sherry was much in demand. Professor Kingsley Smellie pointed to a bottle and said to Cranston : 'I hope you've ordered buckets of that stuff'. 'I have', Cranston replied without malice, 'not quite in those terms'.\u000a\u000aHe died 5 November 1993 of a heart attack while taping a television production in [[London]] for the BBC.
