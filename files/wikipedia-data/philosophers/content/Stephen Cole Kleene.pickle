One of the students of [[Alonzo Church]], Kleene, along with [[Alan Turing]], [[Emil Post]], and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of [[mathematical logic]] known as [[recursion theory]], which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical [[computer science]]. Kleene's work grounds the study of which functions are [[computable function|computable]]. A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: [[Kleene hierarchy]], [[Kleene algebra]], the [[Kleene star]] (Kleene closure), [[Kleene's recursion theorem]] and the [[Kleene fixpoint theorem]]. He also invented [[regular expressions]], and made significant contributions to the foundations of [[mathematical intuitionism]].\u000a\u000aAlthough his last name is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|l|i\u02d0|n|i\u02d0}} {{respell|KLEE|nee}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|l|i\u02d0|n}} {{respell|kleen}}, Kleene himself pronounced it {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|l|e\u026a|n|i\u02d0}} {{respell|KLAY|nee}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pace |first=Eric |date=January 27, 1994 |title=Stephen C.

He was awarded the Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Princeton University]] in 1934. His thesis, entitled ''A Theory of Positive Integers in Formal Logic'', was supervised by [[Alonzo Church]]. In the 1930s, he did important work on Church's [[lambda calculus]]. In 1935, he joined the mathematics department at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], where he spent nearly all of his career. After two years as an instructor, he was appointed assistant professor in 1937.\u000a\u000aWhile a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, 1939\u201340, he laid the foundation for [[recursion theory]], an area that would be his lifelong research interest. In 1941, he returned to Amherst College, where he spent one year as an associate professor of mathematics.\u000a\u000aDuring [[World War II]], Kleene was a lieutenant commander in the [[United States Navy]]. He was an instructor of navigation at the U.S. Naval Reserve's Midshipmen's School in [[New York (state)|New York]], and then a project director at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\u000a\u000aIn 1946, Kleene returned to [[Wisconsin]], becoming a full professor in 1948 and the Cyrus C. MacDuffee professor of mathematics in 1964. He was chair of  the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, 1962\u201363, and [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the College of Letters and Science from 1969 to 1974. The latter appointment he took on despite the considerable student unrest of the day, stemming from the [[Vietnam War]]. He retired from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wiscons]]in in 1979. In 1999 the mathematics library at the University of Wisconsin was renamed in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=About S.C.

Kleene (1952) wrote alternative proofs to the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] that enhanced their canonical status and made them easier to teach and understand. Kleene and Vesley (1965) is the classic American introduction to [[intuitionist logic]] and [[mathematical intuitionism|mathematics]].\u000a\u000aKleene served as president of the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], 1956\u201358, and of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science,<ref>\u000a[http://www.icsu.org/publicdb/frmDisplayMember?docid=97d44bb2b86ba6e145872f68db2d0d62 IUHPS website]; also known as "International Union of the History and the Philosophy of Science".

In 1990, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].\u000a\u000aKleene and his wife Nancy Elliott had four children. He had a lifelong devotion to the family farm in Maine. An avid mountain climber, he had a strong interest in [[nature]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], and was active in many [[conservation movement|conservation]] causes.\u000a\u000a==Important publications==\u000a*1936. « General recursive functions of natural numbers », ''Math.
