V{{One source|section|date=July 2014}}\u000a'''Elliot N. Dorff''' (born 24 June 1943) is a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]]. He is a professor of Jewish [[theology]] at the [[American Jewish University]] (formerly the [[University of Judaism]]) in [[California]] (where he is also [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]), author and a bio-ethicist.\u000a\u000aDorff is an expert in the philosophy of Conservative Judaism, [[Bioethics]], and acknowledged within the Conservative community as an expert [[posek|decisor]] of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Dorff was ordained as a rabbi from the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in 1970. He earned a Ph.D in [[philosophy]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1971.\u000a\u000aDorff is the chairman of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]'s [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], and has written many [[responsa]] (opinion papers and legal rulings) on various aspects of Jewish law and philosophy. (There is a separate article on [[Conservative responsa]].)\u000a\u000a==Philosophy of religion==\u000aAmong other topics, Dorff is interested in [[Jewish philosophy]]. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that addresses questions such as: "What is knowledge?", "How is knowledge acquired?", and "How do we know what we know?" In addressing this subject the first issue to note is that the terms "knowledge" and "belief" are often used interchangeably by religious believers, but technically these are very distinct terms.\u000a\u000aAs a philosopher, Dorff asks about the difference between belief and knowledge. Given the philosophical definition that knowledge differs from belief (knowledge is often defined as a ''justified, true belief''), Dorff's works explicitly analyze [[epistemology|epistemological questions]]. His philosophy of religion, as illustrated especially in his book ''Knowing God: Jewish Journeys to the Unknowable'', stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, with careful attention to the grounds of justified belief. He claims, however, that the Jewish tradition did not base its belief in God primarily on intellectual activity because Judaism is theistic, believing in a personal God: just as we do not come to know people through creating proofs of their existence, so too that has not been the primary way in which Jews have come to know God. Instead, to know people we talk with them and do things with them, and the same is true for how we come to know God: We talk to God through prayer; God talks to us through revelation; we do things with God through following God's commandments; and God does things with us by acting in history. In Knowing God there is a chapter on each of those aspects of the interaction that gives us knowledge of God.\u000a\u000aIn his book ''Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors to Our Descendants'', Dorff creates and then explains a chart of various views of revelation and Jewish law, including the mainstream Orthodox approach, four Conservative approaches, and the Reform approach. In it he describes himself as "Conservative III," according to which revelation holds no content in of itself; rather, God inspired people with His presence by coming into contact with them. In this view the Bible is a human response to our ancestors' encounters with God, and revelation continues each time we study and reinterpret Jewish classical texts.\u000a\u000a==Bioethics==\u000aIn the spring of 1993, Dorff served on the ethics committee of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s Health Care Task Force, and in March 1997 and May 1999, he, along with other rabbis, testified on behalf on the Jewish tradition on the subjects of human cloning and stem cell research before the president's National Bioethics Advisory Commission. In 1999-2000, he served on the U.S. Surgeon General's Task Force to create a Call to Action for responsible sexual behavior, and between 2000-2002 he served on the National Human Resources Protections Advisory Commission, charged with reviewing and revising the federal guidelines on research on human beings. He is now on the California Ethics Advisory Commission for embryonic stem cell research done within the state.\u000a\u000aDorff is a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]], a preeminent research institution dedicated to the examination of issues in bioethics.\u000a\u000a==Other areas of ethics==\u000aDorff has written several anthologies on Jewish ethics and theologies with his co-author, [[Carleton College]] religion professor [[Louis E. Newman]]. In addition, he has written books on social ethics (To Do the Right and the Good, and The Way into Tikkun Olam [Repairing the World]) and personal ethics (Love Your Neighbor and Yourself). His books on social ethics include chapters on interfaith relations, pluralism within the Jewish community, poverty, justice, war, and communal forgiveness. His book on personal ethics includes chapters on privacy, sexual ethics, family violence, how we talk to and about each other, parents and children, and hope.\u000a\u000aIn addition to these chapters on specific areas of ethics, Dorff has written extensively on issues in ethical theory\u2014in particular, the relationships between religion and ethics and between Jewish law and ethics.  These can be found in the first chapters and the appendicies of the books mentioned above as well as in his book on Jewish law, described below.\u000a\u000a==Jewish law==\u000aDorff is a rare example of someone who has written about the theory of Jewish law and has also written rabbinic rulings (teshuvot) on a number of issues in Jewish law. In his book ''The Unfolding Tradition'', he describes and analyzes fifteen theories of Jewish law within the Conservative Movement with comparisons to theories on the right in Orthodoxy and on the left in Reform Judaism and yet further left. He articulates his own theory of Jewish law as a living, organic system in his book ''For the Love of God and People: A Philosophy of Jewish Law''. In addition to describing how he understands Jewish law as being like a human being with a body (=the body of Jewish law, the corpus juris) and soul (=the Covenant between God and the Jewish People), he has specific chapters on the interaction between Jewish law and morality, theology, and custom, followed by some comparisons to the right and left of his approach and some specific examples of his own rabbinic rulings that illustrate his theory.\u000a\u000a==Communal activities==\u000aIn [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Dorff is a member of the ''Board of Jewish Family Service'' and has served as its president (2004\u20132006). Since 2008 he has been a member of the Board of the Los Angeles Jewish Federation Council, co-chairing its task force on Serving the Vulnerable. Since the 1980s he has been a member of the Ethics Committees of [[UCLA Medical Center]] and the Jewish Homes for the Aging. He is co-chairman of the "Priest-Rabbi Dialogue" sponsored by the Los Angeles Archdiocese and the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, and he is the former President and current Board member and Treasurer of the Academy of Judaic, Christian, and Islamic Studies. He is Secretary of the Board of the Faithtrust Institute, dedicated to stopping violence against women and children.  He is a past president of three academic societies: The Jewish Law Association, The Jewish Philosophical Association, and the Society for Jewish Ethics.\u000a\u000a==Scholarship==\u000aDorff has written over two hundred articles on Jewish ethics, Jewish thought, Jewish law and custom ([[halakhah]]), and bioethics and has written twelve books on these topics and edited or co-edited another twelve.\u000a\u000a==Responsa==\u000aOn December 6, 2006, the law committee accepted a paper by Rabbis Elliot Dorff, [[Daniel Nevins]] and [[Avram Reisner]] on [[same-sex marriage]] and ordination of homosexual rabbis, while it upheld the biblical prohibition on male intercourse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17355&intcategoryid=4 |title= Conflicting Conservative opinions expected to open the way for gays |accessdate=2006-12-07 |author=Ben Harris  |authorlink= |date=2006-12-06  |format= |work= |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency  |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211044018/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17355&intcategoryid=4 |archivedate=2006-12-11 |quote=At the University of Judaism in Los Angeles, leaders long have made clear their intention to ordain gay rabbis if the law committee allowed it.
