Among advocates of "ecospirituality" and the "New Story," he is famous for proposing the idea that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. He is considered a leader in the tradition of [[Teilhard de Chardin]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Thomas|title=The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth|date=Mar 1, 2011|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=9781570759178|pages=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixitIHiUZD4C}}</ref>\u000a\u000aBerry believed that humanity, after generations spent in self-glorification and despoiling the world, is poised to embrace a new role as a vital part of a larger, interdependent \u201ccommunion of subjects\u201d on earth and in the universe.\u000a\u000aBerry said the transformation of humanity\u2019s priorities will not come easily.

He was named for his father, William Nathan Berry, who founded Berico Fuels in 1924. At age 11 he had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] in a meadow, which became a primary reference point for the rest of his life. He later elaborated this experience into a set of ''Twelve Principles for Understanding the Universe and the Role of the Human in the Universe Process''. The first of these principles states:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>The universe, the solar system, and planet earth in themselves and in their evolutionary emergence constitute for the human community the primary revelation of that ultimate mystery whence all things emerge into being.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lonergan|first1=Anne|last2=Richards|first2=Caroline|title=Thomas Berry and the New Cosmology|date=1987|publisher=Twenty-Third Publications|isbn=9780896223370|pages=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7doAAAACAAJ}}</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aBerry entered a monastery of the [[Passionist]] order in 1933, where he adopted the name "Thomas," after Thomas Aquinas. He was ordained in 1942. He began studying [[cultural history]], especially the world's religions. \u000a\u000aHe received his doctorate in [[history]] from [[The Catholic University of America]], with a thesis on  [[Giambattista Vico]]'s [[philosophy]] of history.  He then studied [[Chinese language]] and [[Chinese culture]] in [[China]] and learned [[Sanskrit]] for the study of [[India]] and the traditions of [[religion in India]]. He published a book on the religions of India and one on Buddhism. Later he assisted in an educational program for the [[T'boli]] tribal  peoples of [[South Cotabato]], a province of the island of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]], and he taught the cultural history of [[India]] and [[China]] at universities in [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] (1956\u20131965). Later he was director of the graduate program in the [[History of Religions]] at [[Fordham University]] (1966\u20131979). He founded and directed the [[Riverdale Center of Religious Research]] in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[New York (state)|New York]] (1970\u20131995). Berry studied and was influenced by the work of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] and was president of the [[American Teilhard Association]] (1975\u20131987). He also studied [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures and [[shamanism]]. From his academic beginnings as a historian of world cultures and religions, Berry developed into a historian of the Earth and its evolutionary processes. He described himself as a "geologian".\u000a\u000aIn 1995, Berry returned to Greensboro, North Carolina. While nominally retired, he continued to write, lecture, and receive friends at his home. In a tribute to Berry, Mary Evelyn Tucker says that his books&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Dream of the Earth'' (1988 reprinted, 2006), ''The Universe Story'' (with Brian Swimme, 1992), and ''The Great Work: Our Way into the Future'' (1999)&nbsp;\u2013 are "major contributions to the discussion on the environment". A collection of his essays, ''Evening Thoughts: Reflecting on Earth as Sacred Community'', was jointly published by Sierra Club Books and the University of California Press.<ref name=NYTO /><ref name=POO>{{cite web|title=Passionist Order Obituary|url=http://www.thomasberry.org/tributes_and_photos/Berry_obituary.jpg|website=Thomas Berry Foundation|accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref name = Tribute>Tucker, Mary Ellen (Jun 10, 2009) [http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/columns/tribute-to-thomas-berry A Tribute to Thomas Berry (1914-2009), Scholar, Visionary, Planet Lover].
