He is [[Teresa Mattei]]'s son.\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aSanguinetti was deported from [[France]] in 1971 and settled in [[Italy]].\u000a\u000aBy 1972, Sanguinetti and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of the SI.

The pamphlet was to show how the ruling class of Italy supported the  [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other covert, [[false flag]] mass slaughter, for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from the communist claims. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine, and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalist praised its content and guessed on the identity of its high-profile author. After reprinting the tract into a small book, Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. Scandal raised after the revelation, as it successfully exposed the truth and hypocrisy on the mass slaughters,<ref>[http://www.notbored.org/report.html Gianfranco Sanguinetti<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and under pressure from Italian authorities, Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied entry to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\u000a\u000a== Published works ==\u000a* [[The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy]] (1975)\u000a* [[On Terrorism and the State]] (1979)\u000a* [[Remedy to Everything]] (1980)\u000a\u000a== Notes and references ==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a== Sources ==\u000a* [[Éditions Champ Libre]], ''Correspondance'', volume 2, éditions Champ Libre, 1981\u000a* [[Guy Debord]], ''Correspondance'', volumes 4 et 5, Fayard\u000a* [[Christophe Bourseiller]], ''Histoire générale de l'ultra-gauche'', Denoël, ISBN 2207251632\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a{{Wikisource author}}\u000a* [http://www.notbored.org/sanguinetti.html Gianfranco Sanguinetti: Texts in translation] by ''Not Bored!''\u000a* {{fr}} [http://parolesdesjours.free.fr/situationnismeitalie.pdf Brief story of the Italian section of the International situationist] by Miguel Amorós\u000a \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Sanguinetti, Gianfranco}}\u000a[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Continental philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Situationists]]\u000a[[Category:Social philosophy]]\u000a[[Category:1948 births]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]
