He is best known for popularizing the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], for his lectures at the University of Edinburgh were widely disseminated by his many influential students.\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aHe was the son of [[Matthew Stewart (mathematician)|Matthew Stewart]] (1715\u20131785), professor of mathematics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1747\u20131772), and was born in Edinburgh. He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] and the University of Edinburgh, where he read mathematics and [[moral philosophy]] under [[Adam Ferguson]]. In 1771, in the hope of gaining a [[Snell Exhibition]] and proceeding to [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] to study for the English Church, he went to the University of Glasgow to attend the classes of [[Thomas Reid]]. To Reid he later owed his theory of [[morality]]. In Glasgow, Stewart boarded in the same house as [[Archibald Alison (Scottish author)|Archibald Alison]], author of the ''Essay on Taste'', and a lasting friendship sprang up between them.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Stewart, Dugald|volume=25|pages=913-914}}</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter a single session in Glasgow, at the age of nineteen, Dugald was asked by his father, whose health was beginning to fail, to give his mathematical classes in the University of Edinburgh. After three years there Dugald was elected professor of mathematics in conjunction with his father in 1775. Three years later Ferguson was appointed secretary to the commissioners sent out to the [[13 colonies|American colonies]], and at his request Stewart lectured as his substitute during the session 1778\u20131779, delivering an original course of lectures on morals.<ref name="EB1911"/> In his early years he was influenced by [[Lord Monboddo]], with whom he corresponded.\u000a\u000a==Professor at Edinburgh==\u000aIn 1785 Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the chair of [[moral philosophy]], which he filled for twenty-five years, making it a centre of intellectual and moral influence. Young men were attracted by his reputation from England, Europe and America. Stewart's course on moral philosophy embraced, besides ethics proper, lectures on [[political philosophy]] or the theory of government.<ref name="EB1911"/>\u000a\u000aStewart spent the summers of 1788 and 1789 in France, where he met [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Suard|Suard]], [[Degérando]], and [[Guillaume Thomas François Raynal|Raynal]], and came to sympathise with the revolutionary movement.<ref name="EB1911"/> His political teaching, after the [[French Revolution]], drew suspicion on him.\u000a\u000aFrom 1800 to 1801, Stewart gave lectures to undergraduate students on the subject of [[political economy]], the first person to do so.<ref>[http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/economics/about-us/history/early-years The early years] at [[University of Edinburgh School of Economics]]'s official website. Accessed 24 February 2013.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Later life==\u000aIn 1806 Stewart received in lieu of a pension the nominal office of the writership of the ''Edinburgh Gazette'', with a salary of £300. When he ceased lecturing during the session of 1809\u20131810, his place was taken, at his own request, by [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], who in 1810 was appointed conjoint professor. On the death of Brown in 1820 Stewart retired altogether from the professorship. His successor was [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]], known as "Christopher North".<ref name="EB1911"/>\u000a\u000aFrom 1809 onwards Stewart lived mainly at [[Kinneil House]], Bo'ness, which was placed at his disposal by the [[Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]].<ref name="EB1911"/> In June 1814 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=3&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27stewart%27%29|title= Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1817.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000a[[File:DugaldStewartMonument.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Dugald Stewart Monument]], Edinburgh]]\u000aIn 1822 he was struck with [[paralysis]], but recovered a fair degree of health, sufficient to enable him to resume his studies. He died in Edinburgh, where he was buried in [[Canongate Churchyard]]. Additionally, and of greater public note, a [[Dugald Stewart Monument|monument]] to his memory was erected on [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]].<ref name="EB1911"/> His memory is also honoured by the newly constructed Dugald Stewart Building at the University of Edinburgh, on Charles Street.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000aStewart as a student in Glasgow wrote an essay on ''Dreaming''. In 1792 he published the first volume of the ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind''; the second volume appeared in 1814, the third not till 1827. In 1793 he printed a textbook, ''Outlines of Moral Philosophy'', which went through many editions; and in the same year he read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh his ''Account of the Life and Writings of [[Adam Smith]]''. Similar memoirs of Robertson the historian and of Reid were afterwards read before the same body and appear in his published works.<ref name="EB1911"/>\u000a\u000aIn 1805 Stewart published pamphlets defending [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] against the charges of unorthodoxy made by the presbytery of Edinburgh. In 1810 appeared the ''Philosophical Essays'', in 1814 the second volume of the ''Elements'', in 1811 the first part and in 1821 the second part of the "Dissertation" written for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica Supplement'', entitled "A General View of the Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of Letters." In 1827 he published the third volume of the ''Elements'', and in 1828, a few weeks before his death, ''The Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers''.<ref name="EB1911"/>\u000a\u000aStewart's works were edited in 11 vols.

Part of his originality lay in his incorporation of elements of moderate [[empiricism]] and the French ideologists [[Pierre Laromiguière|Laromiguière]], [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] and [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy|Destutt de Tracy]]. He opposed the argument of [[ontology]], and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]]'s sensationalism. [[Immanuel Kant]] he said he could not understand.<ref>Jonathan Friday (2005): Dugald Stewart on Reid, Kant and the Refutation of Idealism, British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 13:2, 263\u2013286</ref>\u000a\u000a==Family==\u000aIn 1783 Stewart married Helen Bannatyne, who died in 1787, leaving an only son, Colonel Matthew Stewart. In 1790 he married [[Helen D'Arcy Cranstoun]], sister of [[George Cranstoun, Lord Corehouse|George Cranstoun]].  His second wife was well-born and accomplished, and he was in the habit of submitting to her criticism whatever he wrote. They had a son and a daughter. The son's death in 1809 brought about his retirement from the active duties of his chair.<ref name="EB1911"/>\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a* Corsi, Pietro.
