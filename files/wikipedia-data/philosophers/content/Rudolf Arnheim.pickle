He learned [[Gestalt psychology]] from studying under [[Max Wertheimer]] and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] at the [[University of Berlin]] and applied it to art.<ref name="Uta Grundmann">[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/rudolfarnheim.php The Intelligence of Vision: An Interview with Rudolf Arnheim]</ref> His magnum opus was his book ''Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye'' (1954). Other major books by Arnheim have included ''Visual Thinking'' (1969), and ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts'' (1982). ''Art and Visual Perception'' was revised, enlarged and published as a new version in 1974, and it has been translated into fourteen languages.  He lived in Germany, Italy, England, and America.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  Most notably, Arnheim taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Harvard University, and the [[University of Michigan]].<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  He has greatly influenced art history and psychology in America.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />\u000a\u000aAlthough ''Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye'' took fifteen months to complete, Arnheim stated that he felt that he essentially wrote it in one long sitting.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /> In ''Art and Visual Perception'', Arnheim tries to use science to better understand art, still keeping in mind the important aspects of personal bias, intuition, and expression.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /> In his later book ''Visual Thinking'' (1969), Arnheim challenges the differences between thinking versus perceiving and intellect versus intuition.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /> In it Arnheim critiques the assumption that language goes before perception and that words are the stepping stones of thinking.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /> Sensory knowledge, for Arnheim, allows for the possibility of language, since the only access to reality we have is through our senses.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  Visual perception is what allows us to have a true understanding of experience.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" /> Arnheim also argues that perception is strongly identified with thinking, and that artistic expression is another way of reasoning.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /> In his book titled ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts'' (1982), Arnheim addresses the interaction of art and architecture on concentric and grid spatial patterns.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /> Arnheim argues that form and content are indivisible, and that the patterns created by artists reveal the nature of human experience.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />\u000a\u000a== Early Years ==\u000aRudolf Arnheim was born into a Jewish family in 1904 on [[Alexanderplatz]], in Berlin.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" /><ref name="Roy R. Behrens">[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1576578 Rudolf Arnheim: The Little Owl on the Shoulder of Athene]</ref>  Not long after he was born, his family moved to Kaiserdamm in Charlottenburg, where they stayed until the early 1930s.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  He was interested in art from a young age, as he began drawing as a child.<ref name="David A. Pariser">[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1320699 A Conversation with Rudolf Arnheim]</ref>  His father, Georg Arnheim, owned a small piano factory, and Georg Arnheim\u2019s plan for his son was for him to take over the factory.  However, Rudolf wanted to continue his education, so his father agreed that he could spend half his week at the university and the other half at the factory.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  Rudolf ended up spending more time at the university, and when he was at the factory he was distracting the employees with his inquisitions about the mechanics of the piano, so his father agreed to let him focus entirely on his education.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" /><ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  Rudolf was interested in psychology as long as he could remember, with his specific memory of buying some of the first editions of Sigmund Freud\u2019s books when he was fifteen or sixteen.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  These fueled his interest in [[psychoanalysis]].<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />\u000a\u000a== University of Berlin ==\u000aArnheim attended the University of Berlin, where he wished to focus his studies on psychology.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  At that time, psychology was a branch of philosophy, so Arnheim ended up majoring in experimental psychology and philosophy, and minoring in art history and music.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" /><ref name="David A. Pariser" />  There were many prominent faculty members at the university at this time, the most notable being [[Albert Einstein]], [[Max Planck]], Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  Because Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Köhler were in the psychology department, most of the psychology concerned Gestalt Psychology.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  The Psychological Institute of Berlin University was located on two floors of the Imperial Palace, so Arnheim worked in makeshift laboratories decorated with paintings of angels and other artwork.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  This institute was more of a workshop because everyone was doing experiments and using each other rather than sitting in lectures.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  For Arnheim\u2019s dissertation, Max Wertheimer asked him to study human facial expressions and handwriting and how they corresponded.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  He looked at the extent to which people perceive an expression when they look at a face and what they perceive from a person\u2019s handwriting, as well as how the two corresponded.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  This was the beginning of Arnheim\u2019s study of expression, which he moved to looking at with visual arts.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  In 1928, he received his doctorate.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />\u000a\u000a== Professional contributions ==\u000aIn the mid-20s, Arnheim started writing film criticism for the ''Stachelschwein''.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  Meanwhile, he sent his works to [[Siegfried Jacobsohn]], the chief editor at ''Die Weltbühne'', who accepted them.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  When Jacobsohn died in 1928, [[Ossietzky]] took over and then Arnheim came to work on the cultural section until 1933.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  In the fall of 1932, Arnheim had an essay published in the ''Berliner Tagesblatt''.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  This was about three months before the Nazis came into power, and the essay was published about the nature of [[Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin\u2019s]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler\u2019s]] moustaches and what it did to the nose in terms of human character.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  Considering the timing of this essay, and the fact that in 1933 the sale of his book ''Film as Art'' was no longer permitted due to the Nazis, some of Arnheim\u2019s friends advised him that he should leave the country and so in August 1933,<ref name="Uta Grundmann" /><ref name="David A. Pariser" /> he moved to Rome.\u000a\u000a== Immigration Around Europe and to the United States ==\u000aArnheim lived and wrote about film and radio in Rome for the next six years.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  When World War II broke out, he moved to London, and he worked as a wartime translator for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  He moved to the United States in 1940 and was shocked by all the lights of New York City.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  For him it was \u201cthe end of exile\u201d since he had been used to living with constant black outs in London.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />\u000a\u000a== Career in the United States ==\u000aIn 1943 he became a psychology professor at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and a visiting lecturer at the [[New School of Social Research]].<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  Around this time he received two major awards.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  First, he received a Fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  With this he worked at Colombia University with their Office of Radio Research to analyze soap-operas and how they affected American audiences.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  He also received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1942 in order to study perception in art.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  He ideally wanted to write about applying Gestalt theory to visual arts, but felt he did not have enough research.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  He postponed the book in order to do more studies on space, expression, and movement.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  In 1951, Arnheim got another Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship so that he could take a leave from teaching and he wrote ''Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye''.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />\u000a\u000aArnheim was invited to join [[Harvard University]] as Professor of the Psychology of Art in 1968, and he stayed there for six years.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  The [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] at Harvard was an important building to him, as it was the only building designed in America by Le Courbusier and it was based on the modular theory.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  He retired in 1974 to Ann Arbor with his wife Mary.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  He became a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Michigan]] and taught there for ten years.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  Arnheim was a part of the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] and was their president for two terms, and was also the president for the Division on Psychology and the Arts of the [[American Psychological Association]] for three terms.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  In 1976 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<ref name="Roy R. Behrens" />  He died in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Rudolf Arnheim, 102, Psychologist and Scholar of Art and Ideas, Dies|work=Obituaries|date=June 14, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/obituaries/14arnheim.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-05-09}}</ref>\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aAlthough ''Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye'' took fifteen months to complete, he felt that he essentially wrote it in one long sitting.<ref name="Roy R.

Behrens" />\u000a\u000a== Theories ==\u000aArnheim believed that most people have their most productive ideas in their early twenties.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  They get hooked on an idea and spend the rest of their lives expanding on it.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  Arnheim\u2019s productive or generative idea was that the meaning of life and the world could be perceived in the patterns, shapes, and colors of the world.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  Therefore, he believed that we have to study those patterns and discover what they mean.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  He also believed that artwork is visual thinking and a means of expression, not just putting shapes and colors together that look appealing.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  Art is a way to help people understand the world, and a way to see how the world changes through your mind.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  Its function is to show the essence of something, like our existence.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  Arnheim\u2019s writing and thinking were most important to him, and his goal was to understand things for himself.<ref name="David A. Pariser" />  Arnheim maintained that vision and perception are creative, active understanding, and that we organize perceptions into structures and form with which to understand them.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  Without order we wouldn\u2019t understand anything, so the world is ordered just by being perceived.<ref name="Uta Grundmann" />  Overall, he wrote fifteen books about perceptual psychology and art, architecture, and film.<ref name="Roy R.
