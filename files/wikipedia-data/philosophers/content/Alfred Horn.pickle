V'''Alfred Horn''' (February 17, 1918 &ndash; April 16, 2001) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] notable for his work in [[lattice theory]] and [[universal algebra]]. His 1951 paper "On sentences which are true of direct unions of algebras" described [[Horn clause]]s and [[Horn sentence]]s, which later would form the foundation of [[logic programming]].\u000a\u000aHorn was born on [[Lower East Side, Manhattan]]. His parents were both [[deaf]], and his father died when Horn was three years old. At this point, the children moved in with their grandparents on the mother's side. They would later move to [[Brooklyn]] where Horn spent most of his childhood, raised by his extended family.\u000a\u000aHorn attended the [[City College of New York]], and later, [[New York University]] where he earned a [[Master's degree]] in [[mathematics]]. He went on to earn his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1946. A year later, he started work at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1988. \u000a\u000aHe died in 2001 in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]] after eight years of battling [[prostate cancer]].\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130905163259/http://www.math.ucla.edu/info/horn.html Alfred Horn, Palisadian Since 1954 and Noted UCLA Math Professor] &ndash; [[obituary]] from UCLA\u000a* [http://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/fmi/logic/skordev/ln/lp/ahornpbl.htm Publications of Alfred Horn] &ndash; a list compiled by [[Dimiter Skordev]]\u000a* [http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=31660 Alfred Horn] &ndash; the information about him in the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn, Alfred}}\u000a[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\u000a[[Category:American logicians]]\u000a[[Category:Lattice theorists]]\u000a[[Category:1918 births]]\u000a[[Category:2001 deaths]]\u000a[[Category:City University of New York alumni]]\u000a[[Category:New York University alumni]]\u000a[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\u000a[[Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty]]
