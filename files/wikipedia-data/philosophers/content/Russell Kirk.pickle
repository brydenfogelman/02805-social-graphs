His 1953 book, ''The Conservative Mind'', gave shape to the amorphous post-[[World War II]] conservative movement. It traced the development of conservative thought in the Anglo-American tradition, giving special importance to the ideas of [[Edmund Burke]]. Kirk was also considered the chief proponent of [[traditionalist conservatism]].\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aRussell Kirk was born in [[Plymouth, Michigan]]. He was the son of Russell Andrew Kirk, a railroad engineer, and Marjorie Pierce Kirk. Kirk obtained his BA at [[Michigan State University]] and a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] at [[Duke University]]. During [[World War II]], he served in the American armed forces and corresponded with a libertarian writer, [[Isabel Paterson]], who helped to shape his early political thought. After the war, he attended the [[University of St. Andrews]] in Scotland. In 1953, he became the only American to be awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] by that university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/about-kirk/ |title=About Russell Kirk |website=kirkcenter.org |publisher=The Russell Kirk Center | date=2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000aKirk "laid out a post-World War II program for conservatives by warning them, 'A handful of individuals, some of them quite unused to moral responsibilities on such a scale, made it their business to [[extirpate]] the populations of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki and Hiroshima]]; we must make it our business to curtail the possibility of such snap decisions.'"<ref>Polner, Murray (March 1, 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref>\u000a\u000aUpon completing his studies, Kirk took up an academic position at his alma mater, Michigan State. He resigned in 1959, after having become disenchanted with that university's academic standards, rapid growth in student numbers, and emphasis on intercollegiate athletics and technical training at the expense of the traditional [[liberal arts]]. Thereafter he referred to Michigan State as "Cow College" or "Behemoth University." He later wrote that academic political scientists and sociologists were "as a breed\u2014dull dogs".<ref>Kirk, Russell, ed., 1982. ''The Portable Conservative Reader''. Viking: xxxviii.</ref> Late in life, he taught one semester a year at [[Hillsdale College]], where he was Distinguished Visiting Professor of Humanities.\u000a\u000aKirk frequently published in two American conservative journals he helped found, ''[[National Review]]'' in 1955 and ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]]'' in 1957. He was the founding editor of the latter, 1957\u201359. Later he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the [[Heritage Foundation]], where he gave a number of lectures.<ref>Many published in his ''The Politics of Prudence'' (1993) and ''Redeeming the Time'' (1998).</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter leaving Michigan State, Kirk returned to his ancestral home in [[Mecosta, Michigan]], where he wrote the many books, academic articles, lectures, and the syndicated newspaper column (which ran for 13 years) by which he exerted his influence on American politics and intellectual life. In 1963, Kirk converted to Catholicism and married Annette Courtemanche; they had four daughters. She and Kirk became known for their hospitality, welcoming many political, philosophical, and literary figures in their Mecosta house (known as "Piety Hill"), and giving shelter to political refugees, hoboes, and others.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/buchanans-revolution/|title=Buchanan\u2019s Revolution: How Pitchfork Pat raised a rebellion\u2014and why it failed. |author=Timothy Stanley |date=February 8, 2012|journal=The American Conservative |publisher=The American Ideas Institute}}</ref> Their home became the site of a sort of seminar on conservative thought for university students.

"Faced with the non-choice between [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Thomas Dewey]] in [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]], Kirk said no to empire and voted for [[Norman Thomas]], the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] candidate."<ref>McCarthy, Daniel (October 12, 2012) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/russell-kirks-conundrum-how-does-a-traditionalist-vote/ How Does a Traditionalist Vote?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> In the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]], he voted for [[Eugene McCarthy]].<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]] (May 19, 2008) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/may/19/00009/ When the Left Was Right], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> In 1992 he supported [[Pat Buchanan]]'s [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1992|primary challenge]] to incumbent [[George H.

For example, [[Harry Jaffa]] (a student of [[Leo Strauss]]) wrote: "Kirk was a poor Burke scholar. Burke's attack on metaphysical reasoning related only to modern philosophy's attempt to eliminate skeptical doubt from its premises and hence from its conclusions."<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Harry V.

Kirk further believed that territorial democracy could reconcile the tension between treating the states as mere provinces of the central government, and as autonomous political units independent of Washington. Finally, territorial democracy allowed Kirk to set out a theory of individual rights grounded in the particular historical circumstances of the United States, while rejecting a universal conception of such rights.\u000a\u000a===Principles===\u000aKirk developed six "canons" of conservatism, which Russello (2004) described as follows:\u000a# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]];\u000a# An affection for the "variety and mystery" of human existence;\u000a# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize "natural" distinctions;\u000a# A belief that [[property]] and [[liberty|freedom]] are closely linked;\u000a# A faith in custom, [[convention (norm)|convention]], and prescription, and\u000a# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.\u000a\u000aKirk said that Christianity and [[western culture|Western Civilization]] are "unimaginable apart from one another"<ref>[http://theoccidentalquarterly.com/vol5no2/52-griffin.html]  {{wayback|url=http://theoccidentalquarterly.com/vol5no2/52-griffin.html |date=20060105051211 }}</ref> and that "all culture arises out of religion.

''The Conservative Mind'' hardly mentions economics at all.\u000a\u000aIn a polemic, Kirk, quoting [[T. S. Eliot]]'s expression, called libertarians "chirping sectaries," adding that conservatives and libertarians share opposition to "collectivism," "the totalist state," and "bureaucracy," but otherwise have "nothing" in common. He called the libertarian movement "an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating." He said a line of division exists between believers in "some sort of transcendent moral order" and "utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct." He included libertarians in the latter category.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Russell|title=Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries|url=http://www.mmisi.org/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf.|work=Modern Age|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|location=Wilmington, DE|pages=345\u2013351|date=Fall 1981}}</ref> Kirk, therefore, questioned the [[fusionism (politics)|"fusionism"]] between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of post-World War II conservatism in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/posts/1165701072.shtml|title=The Volokh Conspiracy \u2013 Russell Kirk, Libertarianism, and Fusionism:|work=volokh.com}}</ref>\u000a\u000aKirk's view of "[[classical liberal]]s" is positive though; he agrees with them on "ordered liberty" as they make "common cause with regular conservatives against the menace of democratic despotism and economic collectivism."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Russell|title=A Dispassionate Assessment of LIbertarians|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/a-dispassionate-assessment-of-libertarians|work=Lecture #158 on Political Thought|publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]] | date= May 28, 1988 |quote=Russell Kirk is a Distinguished Scholar at the Heritage Foundation.

"Not seldom has it seemed," Kirk declared, "as if some eminent Neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States." But no one pointed out to him that he had committed a blunder geographical, that the capital of Israel is Jerusalem and not Tel Aviv. A few years later, in another Heritage Foundation speech, Kirk repeated that line verbatim. In the wake of the Gulf War, which he had opposed, he clearly understood that those words carried even greater meaning.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/July2004/0704Richert.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717103950/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/July2004/0704Richert.html |date=2004 |archivedate=2006-07-17 |author=Scott P.

Furthermore, he argued that such a denunciation "always plays into the hands of the left, which is then able to repeat the charges and claim conservative endorsement of them.<ref name=cofcc />\u000a\u000a===Kirk and the Gulf War===\u000aToward the end of his life, Russell Kirk was highly critical of Republican militarism.

S. Eliot's Moral Imagination in the Twentieth Century'' (1972), ''The Roots of American Order'' (1974), and the autobiographical ''Sword of the Imagination: Memoirs of a Half Century of Literary Conflict'' (1995). As was the case with his hero [[Edmund Burke]], Kirk became renowned for the prose style of his intellectual and polemical writings.<ref>Nash (1998).</ref>\u000a\u000a== Fiction ==\u000a{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\u000aBeyond his scholarly achievements, Kirk was talented both as an [[Storytelling|oral storyteller]] and as an author of [[genre fiction]], most notably in his telling of consummate [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] in the [[Classic book|classic]] tradition of [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[M. R. James]], [[Oliver Onions]], and [[H. Russell Wakefield]]. He also wrote other admired and much-anthologized [[Work of art|works]] that are variously classified as [[Horror fiction|horror]], fantasy, science fiction, and [[political satire]]. These earned him plaudits from fellow [[Creative writing|creative writers]] as varied and distinguished as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Robert Aickman]], [[Madeleine L\u2019Engle]], and [[Ray Bradbury]].\u000a\u000aThough modest in quantity\u2014it encompasses three novels and 22 [[Short story|short stories]]\u2014Kirk's body of fiction was written amid a busy career as prolific [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]] writer, [[Managing editor|editor]], and [[Public speaker|speaker]]. As with such other [[speculative fiction]] authors as [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[C. S. Lewis]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] (all of whom likewise wrote only nonfiction for their "[[day job]]s"), there are [[Traditionalist Conservatism|conservative]] undercurrents\u2014[[Social conservatism|social]], [[Cultural conservatism|cultural]], [[Orthodoxy|religious]], and [[Conservatism|political]]\u2014to Kirk's fiction.\u000a\u000aHis first novel, ''Old House of Fear'' (1961, 1965), as with so many of his short stories, was written in a self-consciously [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] vein. Here the plot is concerned with an American assigned by his [[Employment#Employer|employer]] to a bleak locale in rural Scotland\u2014the same country where Kirk had attended [[graduate school]]. This was Kirk's most [[Commerce|commercially]] successful and critically acclaimed fictional work, doing much to sustain him [[Finance|financially]] in subsequent years.\u000a\u000aLater novels were ''A Creature of the Twilight'' (1966), a [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] [[Satire|satirizing]] [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] African politics; and ''Lord of the Hollow Dark'' (1979, 1989), set in Scotland, which explores the great [[evil]] inhabiting a [[haunted house]]. During his lifetime, Kirk also oversaw the publication of three collections which together encompassed all his short stories. (Three more such collections have been published posthumously, but those only [[reprint]] stories found in the earlier volumes.)\u000a\u000aAmong his novels and stories, certain [[Character (arts)|characters]] tend to recur, enriching the already considerable unity and resonance of his [[Canon (fiction)|fictional canon]]. Though\u2014through their [[Theme (literature)|themes]] and [[prose]]-style\u2014Kirk's fiction and nonfiction works are complementary, many readers of the one have not known of his work in the other.\u000a\u000aHaving begun to write fiction fairly early in his career, Kirk appears to have stopped after the early 1980s, while continuing his nonfiction writing and research through his last year of life.
