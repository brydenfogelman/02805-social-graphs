He was born at [[Nabadwip]] in present-day [[Nadia district]] of [[West Bengal]] state. He was the grandson of {{IAST|\u015aulap\u0101\u1e47i}} (c. 14th century CE), a noted writer on {{IAST|[[Sm\u1e5bti]]}} from his mother's side. He was a pupil of {{IAST|V\u0101sudeva S\u0101rvabhauma}}. He brought the new school of [[Nyaya]], ''{{IAST|Navya Ny\u0101ya}}'', representing the final development of Indian [[formal logic]], to its zenith of analytic power.\u000a\u000aRaghunatha's analysis of relations revealed the true nature of number, inseparable from the abstraction of natural phenomena, and his studies of [[metaphysics]] dealt with the [[negation]] or [[nonexistence]] of a complex [[reality]]. His most famous work in logic was the [[Tattvachintamanididhiti|{{IAST |Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47id\u012bdhiti}}]], a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i}}'' of [[Gangesha|{{IAST |Gange\u015ba Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya}}]], founder of the ''{{IAST |Navya Ny\u0101ya}}'' school.\u000a\u000aA descriptive information of Raghunatha with some controversial issues (his connection with Mahaprabhu Shri [[Chaitanya]]) and bibliography are to be found at \u000a[http://www.scribd.com/doc/64930080/Raghunatha-A-Name-of-Negatives Raghunatha: A Name of Negatives].
