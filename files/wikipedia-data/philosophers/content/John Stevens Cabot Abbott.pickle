He is best known as the author of the widely popular ''History of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'' (1855), in which the various elements and episodes in Napoleon's career are described.  Abbott takes a very favourable view towards his subject throughout. Also among his principal works are: ''History of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in America'' (1863\u20131866), and ''The History of Frederick II, Called [[Frederick the Great]]'' (New York, 1871).
