Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the "doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues."<ref name=":9" /> Baber Johansen, a professor at the Harvard divinity school says that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyyah's incarcerations were, "as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political authorities of the necessity to limit Ibn Taymiyyah's range of action through political censorship and incarceration."<ref name=":7" />\u000a\u000aIbn Taymiyyah's own relationship, as a religious scholar, with the ruling apparatus, who did deviate in application of shari'a law, was not always amicable.<ref name=":9" /> It ranged from silence to open rebellion.<ref name=":9" /> On occasions when he shared the same views and aims as the ruling authorities, his contributions were welcomed but when Ibn Taymiyyah went against the status quo, he was seen as "uncooperative" and on occasions spent much time in prison.<ref name=":3" /> Ibn Taymiyyah's attitude towards his own rulers, was based on the actions of the companions (sahaba) when they made an oath of allegiance to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad as follows; "to obey within obedience to God, even if the one giving the order is unjust; to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it; and to speak out the truth, or take up its cause without fear in respect of God, of blame from anyone."<ref name=":9" />\u000a\u000a== Early years ==\u000a\u000a=== Background ===\u000aIbn Taymiyyah was born in 1263 in [[Harran]] into a well-known family of theologians.

He committed eighty mistakes in his book which are not intelligible to you."{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} Ibn Taymiyyah is thought to have severely criticized Sibawayh but the actual substance of those criticisms is not known because the book that Ibn Taymiyyah wrote, ''al-Bahr'', within which he wrote the criticisms has been lost.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} He stated that when there is an explanation of an [[Ayah]] of the Qur'an or a Hadith, from the Prophet himself, the use of philology or a grammatical explanation becomes obsolete.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} He also said one should refer only to the understanding of the Salaf (first three generations of Muslims) when interpreting a word within the scriptural sources.<ref name=":19" /> However he did not discount the contributions of the grammarians completely.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=20-21}} Ibn Taymiyyah stated that the Arabic nouns within the scriptural sources have been divided by the [[faqih|fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) into three categories; those that are defined by the shari'a, those defined by [[philology]] (lugha) and finally those that are defined by [[urf|social custom (`urf)]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} For him each of these categories of nouns had to be used in their own appropriate manner.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=21-24}}\u000a\u000a=== Madh'hab ===\u000aIbn Taymiyyah censured the scholars for blindly conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any resort to the Qur'an and Sunnah.

Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=":17" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=":17" />\u000a\u000aIbn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi\u2018un|Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi\u2018 al-Tabi\u2018in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=":2" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam.
