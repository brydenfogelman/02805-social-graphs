Kirzner's research on entrepreneurship economics is also widely recognized.<ref>http://swopec.hhs.se/iuiwop/abs/iuiwop0678.htm</ref> His book, ''Competition and Entrepreneurship'' criticizes neoclassical theory for its preoccupation with the model of '''perfect competition''', which neglects the important role of the entrepreneur in economic life. Kirzner's work integrating entrepreneurial action into neoclassical economics has been more widely accepted than nearly any other Austrian idea of the late twentieth century.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Kirzner's major work is in the economics of knowledge and [[entrepreneurship]] and the [[ethics]] of [[markets]]. Kirzner has said that he agrees with Roger Garrison's statement that Kirzner's work takes the middle ground, as opposed to the recent, more extreme position of some Austrian School economists who deny the relevance of market equilibrium.<ref name="vMI Interview"/>\u000aIn 2006, Kirzner received the [[Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research]]<ref>http://www.e-award.org/wfiles/The%20Global%20Award%20for%20Entrepreneurhsip.pdf</ref> " for developing the economic theory emphasizing the importance of the entrepreneur for economic growth and the functioning of the capitalist process.".<ref>http://www.e-award.org/web/2006_Israel_M_Kirzner.aspx</ref> [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] granted him an Honorary Doctorate Degree for his contributions to economic theory.Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín UFM also named its Kirzner Entrepreneurship Center in his honor.<ref>[http://fce.ufm.edu/cms/es/descripcion-KEC Kirzner Entrepreneurship Center ]</ref><ref>[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín ]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Author==\u000aSome of his works on economics include:\u000a* "Entrepreneurial Discovery and The Competitive Market Process: An Austrian Approach," Journal of Economic Literature.
