In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than sixty books and three hundred articles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Shields, Rob | title=Lefebvre Love and Struggle | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 |isbn=0-415-09370-8}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aLefebvre was born in [[Hagetmau]], [[Landes (department)|Landes]], France. He studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris]] (the Sorbonne), graduating in 1920. By 1924 he was working with [[Paul Nizan]], [[Norbert Guterman]], [[Georges Friedmann]], [[Georges Politzer]] and Pierre Morhange in the ''Philosophies'' group seeking a "philosophical revolution".<ref>[http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html Michel Trebitsch: ''Introduction to Critique of Everyday Life'', Vol. 1]</ref> This brought them into contact with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], [[Dada]]ists,  and other groups, before they moved towards the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF).\u000a\u000aLefebvre joined the PCF in 1928 and became one of the most prominent French Marxist Intellectuals during the second quarter of the 20th century, before joining the [[French resistance]].<ref>Mark Poster, 1975, Existential Marxism in Postwar France: From Sartre to Althusser, Princeton University Press</ref>   From 1944 to 1949, he was the director of ''Radiodiffusion Française'', a French radio broadcaster in [[Toulouse]]. Among his works was a highly influential, anti-Stalinist, text on dialectics called ''Dialectical Materialism'' (1940). Seven years later, Lefebvre published his first volume of ''The Critique of Everyday Life''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/lefebvre-interview.html|title=Lefebvre on the Situationists: AnInterview|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> His early work on method was applauded and borrowed centrally by [[Sartre]] in ''The Critique of Dialectical Reason'' (1960). During Lefebvre\u2019s thirty-year stint with the PCF, he was chosen to publish critical attacks on opposed theorists, especially existentialists like Sartre and Lefebvre's former colleague Nizan,<ref>[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&editorial_id=9838 Radical Philosophy obituary, Spring 1992]</ref> only to intentionally get himself expelled from the party for his own heterodox theoretical and political opinions in the late 1950s. Ironically, he then went from serving as a primary intellectual for the PCF to becoming one of France\u2019s most important critics of the PCF\u2019s politics (e.g. immediately, the lack of an opinion on Algeria, and more generally, the  partial apologism for and continuation of [[Stalinism]]) and intellectual thought (i.e. [[Structuralism]], especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]]).<ref>Henri Lefebvre and Leszek Ko\u0142akowski.

Following the publication of this book, Lefebvre wrote several  influential works on cities, urbanism, and space, including ''The Production of Space'' (1974), which became one of the most influential and heavily cited works of [[urban theory]]. By the 1970s, Lefebvre had also published some of the first critical statements on the work of [[post-structuralists]], especially [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]].<ref>[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&editorial_id=9838 Radical Philosophy obituary, 1991]</ref> During the following years he was involved in the editorial group of ''Arguments'', a [[New Left]] magazine which largely served to enable the French public to familiarize themselves with Central European revisionism.<ref>{{cite book | author=Gombin, Richard | title=The Origins of Modern Leftism |publisher=Penguin | year=1971 | isbn=0-14-021846-7}}, p40</ref>\u000a\u000aLefebvre died in 1991. In his obituary, ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'' magazine honored his long and complex career and influence:\u000a:"the most prolific of French Marxist intellectuals, died during the night of 28\u201329 June 1991, less than a fortnight after his ninetieth birthday. During his long career, his work has gone in and out of fashion several times, and has influenced the development not only of philosophy but also of sociology, geography, political science and literary criticism."<ref>''Radical Philosophy'' obituary, 1991.</ref>\u000a\u000a==The critique of everyday life==\u000aOne of Lefebvre's most important contributions to social thought is the idea of the "critique of everyday life," which he pioneered in the 1930s. Lefebvre defined everyday life dialectically as the intersection of "illusion and truth, power and helplessness; the intersection of the sector man controls and the sector he does not control",<ref>{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Critique of Everyday Life |publisher=Verso |year=1947 | isbn=1844671941}}, p40</ref> and is where the perpetually transformative conflict occurs between diverse, specific rhythms: the body\u2019s polyrhythmic bundles of natural rhythms, physiological (natural) rhythms, and social rhythms (Lefebvre and Régulier, 1985: 73).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lefebvre, Henri  |author2=Regular, Catherine | title=Rhythmanalysis|publisher=Continuum |year=2004 | isbn=0826472990}}</ref> The everyday was in short, the space in which all life occurred, and between which all fragmented activities took place.

Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> While the theme presented itself in many works, it was most notably outlined in his eponymous 3 volume study, which came out in individual installments, decades apart, in 1947, 1961, and 1981.\u000a\u000aLefebvre argued that everyday life was an underdeveloped sector compared to technology and production, and moreover that in the mid 20th century, capitalism changed such that everyday life was to be colonized\u2014turned into a zone of sheer consumption. In this zone of everydayness (boredom) shared by everyone in society regardless of class or specialty, autocritique of everyday realities of boredom vs. societal promises of free time and leisure, could lead to  people understanding and then revolutionizing their everyday lives. This was essential to Lefebvre because everyday life was where he saw capitalism surviving and reproducing itself. Without revolutionizing everyday life, capitalism would continue to diminish the quality of everyday life, and inhibit real self-expression. The critique of everyday life was crucial because it was for him only through the development of the conditions of human life\u2014rather than abstract control of productive forces\u2014that humans could reach a concrete utopian existence.<ref>Elden, 2004, pp. 110\u2013126.</ref>\u000a\u000aLefebvre's work on everyday life was heavily influential in French theory, particularly for the Situationists, as well as in politics (e.g. for the May 1968 student revolts).<ref>{{cite book | author=Ross, Kristin | title=May 68 and its afterlives|publisher=University of Chicago |year=2005 | isbn=0226727998}}{{pageneeded|date=September 2016}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==The social production of space==\u000aLefebvre dedicated a great deal of his philosophical writings to understanding the importance of (the production of) space in what he called the reproduction of social relations of production. This idea is the central argument in the book ''The Survival of Capitalism'', written as a sort of prelude to ''La Production de l\u2019espace'' (1974) (''The Production of Space''). These works have deeply influenced current urban theory, mainly within human geography, as seen in the current work of authors such as [[David Harvey]], [[Dolores Hayden]], and [[Edward Soja]], and in the contemporary discussions around the notion of [[Spatial justice]]. Lefebvre is widely recognized as a Marxist thinker who was responsible for widening considerably the scope of Marxist theory, embracing everyday life and the contemporary meanings and implications of the ever expanding reach of the urban in the western world throughout the 20th century. The generalization of industry, and its relation to cities (which is treated in ''La Pensée marxiste et la ville''), ''The Right to the City'' and ''The Urban Revolution'' were all themes of Lefebvre's writings in the late 1960s, which was concerned, among other aspects, with the deep transformation of "the city" into "the urban" which culminated in its omni-presence (the "complete urbanization of society").\u000a\u000aLefebvre contends that there are different modes of production of space (i.e. [[spatialization]]) from natural space ('absolute space') to more complex spatialities whose significance is socially produced (i.e. social space).<ref>''Place, A Short Introduction'' by Tim Cresswell</ref>  Lefebvre analyses each historical mode as a three-part dialectic between everyday practices and perceptions (''le perçu''), representations or theories of space (''le conçu'') and the spatial [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)#The Imaginary and French culture|imaginary]] of the time (''le vécu'').<ref>Shields, Rob, ''Places on the Margin'', Routledge, 1991, ISBN 0-415-08022-3, pp. 50\u201358.</ref>\u000a\u000aLefebvre's argument in ''The Production of Space'' is that space is a social product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. This argument implies the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practices; and the focus on the contradictory, conflictual, and, ultimately, political character of the processes of production of space.<ref>Stanek, Lukasz, ''Henri Lefebvre on Space: Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2011, p. ix.</ref> As a Marxist theorist (but highly critical of the economic structuralism that dominated the academic discourse in his period), Lefebvre argues that this social production of urban space is fundamental to the reproduction of society, hence of capitalism itself. The social production of space is commanded by a [[hegemonic]] class as a tool to reproduce its dominance (see [[Antonio Gramsci]]).\u000a\u000a:"(Social) space is a (social) product [...] the space thus produced also serves as a tool of thought and of action [...] in addition to being a means of production it is also a means of control, and hence of domination, of power."<ref>Lefebvre, Henri, ''The Production of Space'', Blackwell, 1991, ISBN 0-631-18177-6. p. 26.</ref>\u000a\u000aLefebvre argued that every society - and therefore every mode of production - produces a certain space, its own space. The city of the ancient world cannot be understood as a simple agglomeration of people and things in space - it had its own spatial practice, making its own space (which was suitable for itself - Lefebvre argues that the intellectual climate of the city in the ancient world was very much related to the social production of its spatiality). Then if every society produces its own space, any "social existence" aspiring to be or declaring itself to be real, but not producing its own space, would be a strange entity, a very peculiar abstraction incapable of escaping the ideological or even cultural spheres. Based on this argument, Lefebvre criticized Soviet urban planners on the basis that they failed to produce a socialist space, having just reproduced the modernist model of urban design (interventions on physical space, which were insufficient to grasp social space) and applied it onto that context:\u000a:"Change life! Change Society! These ideas lose completely their meaning without producing an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from soviet constructivists from the 1920s and 30s, and of their failure, is that new social relations demand a new space, and vice-versa."<ref>Lefebvre, Henri ''The Production of Space'', Blackwell, 1991, ISBN 0-631-18177-6. p. 59</ref>\u000a\u000a===Criticism to 'The social production of space' and response ===\u000aIn his book ''The Urban Question'', [[Manuel Castells]] criticizes Lefebvre's [[Marxist Humanism]] and approach to the city influenced by [[Hegel]] and [[Nietzsche]]. Castells' political criticisms of Lefebvre's approach to Marxism echoed the Structuralist ''Scientific Marxism'' school of Louis Althusser of which Lefebvre was an immediate critic. Many responses to Castells are provided in ''The Survival of Capitalism'', and some may argue {{who|date=May 2010}} that the acceptance of those critiques in the academic world would be a motive for Lefebvre's effort in writing the long and theoretically dense ''The Production of Space''.\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a*1925 "''Positions d'attaque et de défense du nouveau mysticisme''", ''Philosophies'' 5\u20136 (March). pp.&nbsp;471\u2013506.
