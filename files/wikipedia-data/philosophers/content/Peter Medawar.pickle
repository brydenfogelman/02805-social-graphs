(1952). 'An unsolved problem of biology'  HK Lewis and Co.</ref>) addressed ageing and senescence, and he begins by defining both terms as follows:\u000a{{quote|We obviously need a word for mere ageing, and I propose to use 'ageing' itself for just that purpose. 'Ageing' hereafter stands for mere ageing, and has no other innuendo. I shall use the word 'senescence' to mean ageing accompanied by that decline of bodily faculties and sensibilities and energies which ageing colloquially entails.}}\u000a\u000aHe then tackles the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism's existence, and, therefore, in what he terms "reproductive value." He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of [[natural selection]] weakens progressively with age late in life (because the [[fecundity]] of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by [[life tables]], was an indirect measure of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes. Life tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the [[evolution of ageing|evolution of senescence]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ljubuncic|first=Predrag|last2=Reznick|first2= Abraham Z.|title=The Evolutionary Theories of Aging Revisited &ndash; A Mini-Review|journal=Gerontology|year=2009|volume=55|issue=2|pages=205\u2013216|doi=10.1159/000200772|pmid=19202326}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Charlesworth|title=Fisher, Medawar, Hamilton and the evolution of aging.|journal=Genetics|year=2000|volume=156|issue=3|pages=927\u201331|pmid=11063673| pmc=1461325 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Promislow|first=Daniel E.L.|last2=Pletcher|first2= Scott D.|title=Advice to an aging scientist|journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development|year=2002|volume=123|issue=8|pages=841\u2013850|doi=10.1016/S0047-6374(02)00021-0|pmid=12044932}}</ref>\u000a\u000a=== Books  by Medawar===\u000aMedawar was recognised as a brilliant author: [[Richard Dawkins]] called him "the wittiest of all scientific writers"<ref name=richard/> and ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine's obituary called him "perhaps the best science writer of his generation".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Editorial |title=Peter Medawar (obituary) |journal=New Scientist |volume=116 |issue=1581 |pages=16 |date=October 1987}}</ref> He was also awarded the 1987 [[Michael Faraday Prize]] "''for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture''".\u000a\u000aOne of his best-known essays is his 1961 criticism of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]'s ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'', of which he said: "Its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself".<ref name=Medawar1996>{{cite book |year=1996 |last=Medawar|first= Peter |chapter=The Phenomenon of Man |page=1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8-PkAfzShoC&pg=PA1&dq=phenomenon+of+man+medawar&hl=en&ei=yo6dTJ-WM4ffceGbhdsJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=phenomenon%20of%20man%20medawar&f=false |editor=.|title=The Strange Case of the Spotted Mice: And other classic essays on science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8-PkAfzShoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+strange+case+of+the+spotted+mice#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Oxford, UK & New York: Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-286193-X |accessdate=25 September 2010 |postscript=&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally published 1961 in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', '''70''', 99\u2013106 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Medawar | first1=P.B | year=1961 | title=Critical Notice | journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]| volume=LXX | issue=277 | pages=99\u2013106 | url=http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/LXX/277/99 | doi=10.1093/mind/LXX.277.99 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHis books include,\u000a\u000a{{colbegin||35em}}\u000a*''The Uniqueness of Man'', which includes essays on immunology, graft rejection and acquired immune tolerance\u000a*''Induction and Intuition in Scientific Thought'' \u000a*''[[Best science book ever#Other nominees|Pluto's Republic]]'', incorporating an earlier book of essays, ''The Art of the Soluble''\u000a*''Advice to a Young Scientist'' \u000a*''Aristotle to Zoos'' (with his wife [[Jean Shinglewood Taylor]]);\u000a*''The Life Science''\u000a*''The Limits of Science'' \u000a*''The Future of Man: the BBC [[Reith Lectures]] 1959'', Methuen, London 1960\u000a*''Induction and Intuition in Scientific Thought'', Methuen & Co.

Medawar's work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of [[immunology]] from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself, as in the attempt to suppress the body's [[organ rejection|rejection of organ transplants]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Hyung Wook|title=\u2018The shape of the human being as a function of time\u2019: time, transplantation, and tolerance in Peter Brian Medawar's research, 1937\u20131956|journal=Endeavour|year=2010|volume=34|issue=3|pages=112\u2013121|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2010.07.002|pmid=20692038}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|title=Reminiscences of Sir Peter Medawar: I hope of antigen-specific transplantation tolerance|journal=American Journal of Transplantation|year=2004|volume=4|issue=12|pages=1937\u20131940|doi=10.1111/j.1600-6143.2004.00687.x|pmid=15575894}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Awards and honours===\u000a[[File:Sir PETER MEDAWAR 1915 - 1987 Pioneer of Transplantation Immunology lived here.jpg|thumb|right|Blue plaque erected on 14th July 2014 by English Heritage at 25 Downshire Hill, Hampstead]]\u000aMedawar was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1949|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1949]].<ref name=frs/> With [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] shared the 1960 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1960|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1960/|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> The British government conferred him a CBE in 1958, [[knight bachelor|knighted]] him in 1965, and appointed him to the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] in 1972, and [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] in 1981.

Young, who was Reith Lecturer in 1950. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled ''The Future of Man'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Medawar: The Future of Man: 1959|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lc9|work=BBC Radio4|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve.\u000a\u000aWhilst attending the annual [[British Association]] meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a [[stroke]] when reading the lesson at [[Exeter Cathedral]], a duty which falls on every new President of the [[British Association]]. It was, as he said, "monstrous bad luck because [[James W. Black|Jim Whyte Black]] had not yet devised [[beta-blockers]], which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career".<ref>Medawar P.B. 1986. ''Memoirs of a thinking radish: an autobiography''. Oxford. p153</ref> Medawar\u2019s failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government. Before the stroke, Medawar was one of Britain's most influential scientists, especially in the biomedical field.\u000a\u000aAfter the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, more haemorrhages followed and in 1987 he died in the [[Royal Free Hospital]], London. He is buried \u2014 as is his wife Jean (1913\u20132005) \u2014 at [[Alfriston]] in East Sussex.<ref>Leslie Baruch Brent.

They met while in graduate class at Magdalen. Taylor approached him for the meaning of "[[heuristic]]", which she had to ask twice, and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy. They had two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise. He never knew the exact meaning of his surname, an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word, he was told, for "to make round"; but which a friend explained to him as "little round fat man".\u000a\u000aMedawar was a scientist of great inventiveness who was interested in many other subjects including [[opera]], [[philosophy]] and [[cricket]]. He was exceptionally tall, 6&nbsp;ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. He was renowned for wit and humour, which he claimed inherited from his "raucous" mother. He did not receive a PhD as he could not afford the requisite \u20a425, to which he commented, "Morally I'm a PhD, ... Anyway it was unfashionable in my day. John Young [probably referring to [[John Zachary Young]]] was not a PhD either." He was regarded as the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]'s best-known disciple in science.<ref name=new/>\u000a\u000aMedawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director [[Alex Garland]].{{fact|date=August 2016}}\u000a\u000a=== Views on religion ===\u000aMedawar declared:\u000a{{quote|... I believe that a reasonable case can be made for saying, not that we believe in God because He exists but rather that He exists because we believe in Him... Considered as an element of the world, God has the same degree and kind of objective reality as do other products of mind... I regret my disbelief in God and religious answers generally, for I believe it would give satisfaction and comfort to many in need of it if it were possible to discover and propound good scientific and philosophic reasons to believe in God... To abdicate from the rule of reason and substitute for it an authentication of belief by the intentness and degree of conviction with which we hold it can be perilous and destructive... I am a rationalist\u2014something of a period piece nowadays, I admit...<ref>Peter Medawar 1984. 'The question of the existence of God' in ''The limits of science'' Harper and Row.</ref>}}\u000a\u000aMedawar was also a realist in pointing out in his book "''Advice to a Young Scientist''" that there is no quicker way for a scientist to bring discredit on himself and his profession particularly when no declaration is called for, than to declare that science knows or will know the answers to all questions worth asking. He added that questions that do not admit a scientific answer should not be assumed to be non-questions, "We must turn to imaginative literature and religion for suitable answers!"\u000a\u000aHe also remarked:\u000a{{quote|Religion has not sustained me on any of the occasions when the comfort it professes would have been  most welcome.<ref name=paida/>}}\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a{{reflist|35em}}\u000a\u000a==Sources==\u000a{{Refbegin|colwidth=35em}}\u000a*{{cite journal|last=Billington|first=W David|authorlink=|date=October 2003|title=The immunological problem of pregnancy: 50 years with the hope of progress.
