He taught at the University of Berlin, at [[Lake Forest Academy]] near Chicago, at the [[College of Wooster]], [[Ohio State University]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], before assuming duties in Mexico. In 1955-1956 he was Visiting Professor at [[Yale University]]. Robert S. Hartman spent his later days as simultaneously a Research Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]] as well as at the [[National University of Mexico]]. In the late  1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].\u000a\u000aFrom 1950-1957 he was Chairman of the Commission on Peace, International Council of Community Churches.  He served as  Executive Director of the Council of Profit-Sharing Industries, and wrote its first manual.  He was a founder of the Deutsche Institute fur Social-Wirtschaftliche Betriebsgestaltung (industrial organization). He was a founding sponsor of the [[American Association for Humanistic Psychology]]. He has been credited with being the founding spirit behind the prevailing business-retirement plan in the United States today, the 401K Plan.[http://www.wooster.edu/magazine/fall2003/hartman.php] He was the first President of the [[American Society for Value Inquiry]], founded in 1971 by [[James Wilbur]].\u000a\u000aHe served as consultant for the practical application of Value Theory with [[AT&T]], [[General Foods]], [[General Electric]], and [[IBM]].\u000a\u000aHartman was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1973.\u000a\u000aHartman died in Mexico City on September 20, 1973. He had one child, a son, Jan. Jan Hartman was an Emmy-winning screenwriter, author, and playwright. He died of heart failure in October 2006. For the previous 10 years, Jan lived in Hertfordshire, England, with his wife, Stacey McNutt, a book editor.\u000a\u000aAn Institute has been set up in  honor  of Robert S. Hartman to explore the implications of his work in formal axiology and [[Science of Value|value science]].\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aHe was the subject of doctoral dissertations, including that of a former Chairman of the Philosophy Department at the University of Tennessee, Professor John Davis, as well as of Marvin Charles Katz, whose thesis was later published as a book entitled ''Trends Towards Synthesis''.\u000a\u000aHe has published papers on the phenomenology of group measurement, on universal constants in Physics (in his role as a philosopher of science), on the logic of description and valuation, on the contribution of [[St. Anselm]], and on the Concept of Self in [[Søren Kierkegaard]].\u000a\u000a=== Value theory ===\u000aThe reference book ''Who Knows What'' listed Hartman as one of the two living authorities on value theory (the other was [[Charles W. Morris]] (1903-1979)). Among Hartman's publications are the report on Value Theory for the Institut International de Philosophis 1949-1955, published by UNESCO; his magnum opus ''The Structure of Value'' (1967 Southern Illinois University Press); and at the time of his death in 1973 he was working on a manuscript entitled ''The Measurement of Value''.\u000a\u000aAnother critical work is his Knowledge of Good (Robert S. HARTMAN, Arthur ELLIS and Rem B. EDWARDS, 2002 Rodopi Press) a thorough study of all the philosophical discussions of goodness and what gaps exist in a complete philosophy of value.  Hartman shows how his Formal Value Theory fills these gaps.\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[American philosophy]]\u000a* [[List of American philosophers]]\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a* Robert S.
