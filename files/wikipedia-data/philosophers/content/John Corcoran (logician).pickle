After briefly working in engineering, he studied philosophy at the [[Johns Hopkins University]]:  MA\u000aPhilosophy 1962, PhD. Philosophy 1963. Post-doctoral study: [[Yeshiva University]], Mathematics\u000a1964 and [[University of California Berkeley]], Mathematics 1965. Dissertation: Generative\u000aStructure of Two-valued Logics; Supervisor Robert McNaughton (PhD student of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]).\u000a\u000aCorcoran\u2019s student years, the late 1950s and early 1960s, were wonderful times to be learning logic, its history, and its philosophy.  His first logic teacher was Albert Hammond, who passed on from his own dissertation supervisor [[Arthur Lovejoy]] the tradition of the history of ideas\u2014a tradition that his university, The Johns Hopkins University, had become famous for.  Corcoran studied Plato and Aristotle with [[Ludwig Edelstein]], the historian of Greek science and medicine who held appointments both at The Johns Hopkins University and at its School of Medicine.  His next two logic teachers were both accomplished and knowledgeable symbolic logicians: Joseph Ullian, a Quine PhD, and Richard Wiebe, a Mates PhD who had studied with Carnap and Tarski. \u000aCorcoran\u2019s dissertation supervisor, his doctor father, was Robert McNaughton, a Quine PhD who had already made a name for himself in three fields: the metamathematics of number theory, the theory of formal languages, and the theory of automata.  McNaughton encouraged Corcoran to do post-doctoral studies at Yeshiva University in New York City with [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Martin Davis]], both doctoral students of [[Alonzo Church]].  McNaughton later encouraged Corcoran to go to [[UC Berkeley]], the world center for logic and methodology, and he recommended Corcoran to his Berkeley colleagues.  He was also instrumental in Corcoran\u2019s move to his first tenure-track position, at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where McNaughton was a Professor of Computer and Information Science.  In those early years Corcoran also attended semester-long courses and seminars by several other logicians, including John Addison, a [[Stephen Kleene]] PhD, [[Leon Henkin]], another Church PhD, and [[John Myhill]], another Quine PhD.  Corcoran often mentions his teachers with great respect and warmth.\u000a\u000a==Regular academic or research appointments==\u000aHe has been Professor of Philosophy, [[University at Buffalo]] (SUNY), 1973\u2013; Associate Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo, 1970\u20131973;\u000aAssistant Professor of Linguistics, [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1965\u20131969; Member of\u000aLinguistics Group, IBM Research Center, 1963\u20131964.\u000a\u000a==Visiting academic or research appointments==\u000aHe is or was Visiting Professor of Logic, University of\u000aSantiago de Compostela 1994; Visiting Scholar, Linguistic Institute, SUNY Oswego 1976; NSF\u000aSeminar Project Director, Linguistic Institute, University at Buffalo 1971; Visiting Associate\u000aProfessor of Philosophy and Research Associate, [[University of Michigan]] 1969\u20131970; Visiting\u000aLecturer in Philosophy, [[University of California, Berkeley]] 1964\u20131965; Mathematician, [[General Electric Research Laboratory]] 1962; Mathematician, Aeronca Astromechanics Institute, 1961; Junior\u000aInstructor in Philosophy, [[Johns Hopkins University]] 1960\u20131961.\u000a\u000a==Research profile==\u000a\u000aCorcoran\u2019s work in [[history of logic]] involves most of the discipline\u2019s\u000aproductive periods. He has discussed [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]], [[George Boole]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], the American Postulate Theorists, [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and [[Warren Goldfarb]].\u000a\u000aHis 1972 interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s [[Prior Analytics]],<ref>Degnan, M. 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. Philosophical Books 35.2 (April, 1994): 81-89.</ref> proposed independently by [[Timothy Smiley]] at about the same time, has been found to be more faithful than previous interpretations both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It has formed the basis for subsequent investigations by Edgar Andrade, George Boger, Manuel Correia, Paolo Crivelli, [[Newton da Costa]], Catarina Dutilh, Paolo Fait, Nicolas Fillion, James Gasser, Klaus Glashoff, John Martin, Mary Mulhern, Michael Scanlan, Robin Smith, Neil Tennant, and others. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by [[Gisela Striker]].\u000a\u000aHis 1980 critical reconstruction of Boole\u2019s original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole\u2019s work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole\u2019s philosophy of logic. A 2003 article<ref>Corcoran, John (2003). \u201cAristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought\u201d. ''History and Philosophy of Logic'', '''24''': 261\u2013288. Reviewed by Risto Vilkko.

Also by Marcel Guillaume, ''Mathematical Reviews'' 2033867 (2004m:03006).</ref> provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Boolean logic]]; it also reveals the centrality of [[wholistic reference]] in Boole's [[philosophy of logic]]. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle\u2019s logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did  \u201cgo under, over, and beyond\u201d Aristotle\u2019s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat\u2014to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle\u2014e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\u000a\u000aMore specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole\u2019s \u2018disagreements\u2019, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. \u000aFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle\u2019s four propositional forms of to one form, that of equations\u2014-by itself a revolutionary idea. \u000aSecond, in the realm of logic\u2019s problems, Boole\u2019s addition of equation solving to logic\u2014-another revolutionary idea\u2014-involved Boole\u2019s doctrine that Aristotle\u2019s rules of inference (the \u201cperfect syllogisms\u201d) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. \u000aThird, in the realm of applications, Boole\u2019s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle\u2019s system could not deduce \u201cNo quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\u201d from \u201cNo square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\u201d or from \u201cNo rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle\u201d.\u000a \u000aHis collaboration with Alfred Tarski in the late 1970s and early 1980s<ref>See pp. 361\u2013368 in  {{cite book\u000a|last1=Feferman\u000a|first1=Anita Burdman\u000a|first2=Solomon\u000a|last2=Feferman\u000a|authorlink2=Solomon Feferman\u000a|title=Alfred Tarski:  Life and Logic\u000a|year=2004\u000a|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\u000a|isbn=978-0-521-80240-6\u000a|oclc=54691904\u000a|ref=F-F\u000a}}.</ref> led to publications on Tarski\u2019s work<ref>Corcoran, John, and Sagüillo, José Miguel, 2011. \u201cThe Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper\u201d, ''History and Philosophy of Logic''  '''32''': 359\u201380. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01445340.2011.577145</ref> and to the 2007 article ''Notes on the Founding of Logics and Metalogic: Aristotle, Boole, and Tarski,'' which traces Aristotelian and Boolean ideas in Tarski\u2019s work and which confirms Tarski\u2019s status as a founding figure in logic on a par with Aristotle and Boole.\u000a\u000a==Scientific work==\u000a\u000aHis work in [[philosophy of logic]] focuses on the nature of logic, the role of logic in\u000ainquiry, the conceptual structure of logic, the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[epistemological]] presuppositions\u000aof logic, the nature of [[mathematical logic]] and the gaps between logical theory and mathematical\u000apractice. His [[mathematical logic]] treats [[propositional logic]]s, [[modal logic]]s, identity logics,\u000a[[syllogistic]] logics, the logic of first-order variable-binding term operators, [[second-order logic]]s,\u000a[[model theory]], and [[Concatenation theory|the theory of strings]] \u2013 a discipline which is foundational in all areas of logic\u000aand which provides essential background for all of his other mathematical work. In [[philosophy of mathematics]] Corcoran has been guided by a nuanced and inclusionary [[Platonism]] which\u000astrives to do justice to all aspects of mathematical and logical experience including those aspects\u000aemphasized by competing philosophical perspectives such as [[logicism]], [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]],\u000a[[deductivism]], and [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]. Although several of his philosophical papers presuppose little\u000ahistory or mathematics, his historical papers often involve either original philosophy (e.g. his\u000arecent BSL article \u201cSchemata\u201d) or original mathematics (e.g. his 1980 HPL article\u000a\u201cCategoricity\u201d). He has referred to the mathematical dimension of his approach to history as\u000amathematical archaeology. His philosophical papers often involve original historical research. He has been\u000aguided by the Aristotelian principle that the nature of modern thought is sometimes best\u000aunderstood in light of its historical development, a view that he attributes to [[Arthur Lovejoy]]\u2019s\u000aHistory of Ideas Program at Johns Hopkins University and in which he has been encouraged by\u000athe American philosopher and historian Peter Hare.<ref>Corcoran, John, (2009).

Corcoran emphasizes the\u000aintensely and essentially personal nature of all genuine knowledge including logical knowledge.\u000aNevertheless, he also stresses the importance of communities of knowers and how much each person can\u000abenefit in the personal search for truth from critical cooperation with other objective researchers. For over 40 years he was the leader of the \u201cBuffalo Syllogistic Group\u201d\u2014a community of philosophers, historians, linguists, logicians, and mathematicians dedicated to the study of the origin of logic. The achievements of this community are sketched in his 2009 paper [http://www.revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/idval/article/viewFile/12581/13183 \u201cAristotle\u2019s Logic at the University at Buffalo\u2019s Department of Philosophy\u201d, Ideas y Valores]: Revista Colombiana de Filosofía 140 (August 2009) 99\u2013117.\u000aA list of his publications, complete through 2000, appears in the 1999 volume of [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tf/01445340.html History and Philosophy of Logic], which also includes the expository article by M.
