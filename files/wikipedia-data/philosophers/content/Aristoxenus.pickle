Most of his writings, which dealt with [[philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[music]], have been lost, but one musical treatise, ''Elements of Harmony'' (Greek: \u1f09\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd;<!--genitive in original--> [[Latin]]: ''Elementa harmonica''), survives incomplete, as well as some fragments concerning rhythm and meter. The ''Elements'' is the chief source of our knowledge of ancient Greek music.<ref name=Chambers>"Aristoxenus of Tarentum" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 593.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aAristoxenus was born at [[Taranto|Tarentum]], and was the son of a learned musician named Spintharus (otherwise Mnesias).<ref>Suda, ''Aristoxenos''; Aelian, ''H. A.'' ii. 11.</ref> He learned music from his father, and having then been instructed by [[Lamprus of Erythrae]] and [[Xenophilus]] the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], he finally became a pupil of [[Aristotle]],<ref>Aulus Gellius, iv. 11; Cicero, ''Tusc. Disp.'' i. 18</ref> whom he appears to have rivaled in the variety of his studies. According to the [[Suda]],<ref name="suda">Suda, ''Aristoxenos''</ref> he heaped insults on Aristotle after his death, because Aristotle had designated [[Theophrastus]] as the next [[scholarch|head]] of the [[Peripatetic school]], a position which Aristoxenus himself had coveted having achieved great distinction as a pupil of Aristotle. This story is, however, contradicted by [[Aristocles of Messene|Aristocles]], who asserts that he never mentioned Aristotle but with the greatest respect. Nothing is known of his life after the time of Aristotle's departure, apart from a comment in ''Elementa Harmonica'' concerning his works.<ref>Aristocles ap.

"No more of his life-history is known....")</ref>\u000a\u000a==Overview of his works==\u000aHis writings, said to have consisted of four hundred and fifty-three books,<ref name="suda"/> were in the style of Aristotle, and dealt with [[philosophy]], [[ethics]] and music.  The only work of his that has come down to us is the three books of the ''Elements of Harmony'', an incomplete musical treatise.  Aristoxenus' theory had an empirical tendency; in music he held that the notes of the scale are to be judged, not as the Pythagoreans held, by mathematical ratio, but by the ear.  [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De architectura]]''<ref>Vitruvius, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_139 Book V Chapter IV]</ref> paraphrases the writings of Aristoxenus on music.  His ideas were responded to and developed by some later theorists such as [[Archestratus (music theorist)|Archestratus]], and his place in the methodological debate between rationalists and empiricists was commented upon by such writers as [[Ptolemais of Cyrene]].\u000a\u000aThe theory that the soul is a "harmony" of the [[classical elements|four elements]] composing the body, and therefore mortal ("nothing at all," in the words of [[Cicero]]<ref>Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]] '' 1.22.51, cf. 1.11.24</ref>), was ascribed to Aristoxenus (fr. 118-121 Wehrli) and [[Dicaearchus]]. This theory is comparable to the one offered by [[Simmias of Thebes#Character in Plato.27s Phaedo|Simmias in Plato's ''Phaedo'']].\u000a\u000a==''Elementa harmonica''==\u000aIn his ''[[Elementa harmonica|Elements of Harmony]]'' (also ''Harmonics''), Aristoxenus attempted a complete and systematic exposition of [[Music of ancient Greece|music]]. The first book contains an explanation of the [[Tetrachord|genera]] of Greek music, and also of their [[Octave species|species]]; this is followed by some general definitions of terms, particularly those of [[sound]], [[Interval (music)|interval]], and [[Musical system of ancient greece|system]].<ref name="hawkins66">Sir John Hawkins, (1868), ''A general history of the science and practice of music'', Volume 1, pp. 66-7</ref> In the second book Aristoxenus divides music into seven parts, which he takes to be: the genera, intervals, sounds, systems, tones or modes, mutations, and ''melopoeia''.<ref name="hawkins66"/> The remainder of the work is taken up with a discussion of the many parts of music according to the order which he had himself prescribed.<ref name="hawkins66"/>\u000a\u000aWhile it is often held among modern scholars that Aristoxenus rejected the opinion of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] that arithmetic rules were the ultimate judge of intervals and that in every system there must be found a mathematical coincidence before such a system can be said to be harmonic,<ref name="hawkins66"/> it must be noted that Aristoxenus made extensive use of arithmetic terminology, notably to define varieties of semitones, and dieses in his descriptions of the various genera.<ref name="barker142">Prof Andrew barker, (1989), ''Greek Musical Writings'', Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge University Press, pp. 142-144</ref>\u000a\u000aIn his second book he asserted that "by the hearing we judge of the magnitude of an interval, and by the understanding we consider its many powers."<ref name="hawkins66"/> And further he wrote, "that the nature of melody is best discovered by the perception of sense, and is retained by memory; and that there is no other way of arriving at the knowledge of music;" and though, he wrote, "others affirm that it is by the study of instruments that we attain this knowledge;" this, he wrote, is talking wildly, "for just as it is not necessary for him who writes an Iambic to attend to the arithmetical proportions of the feet of which it is composed, so it is not necessary for him who writes a Phrygian song to attend to the ratios of the sounds proper thereto."<ref name="hawkins66"/> However, this should not be construed as meaning that he postulated a simplistic system of harmony resembling that of modern twelve tone theory, and especially not an equally tempered system. As he urges us to consider, "(a)fter all, with which of the people who argue about the shades of the genera should one agree? Not everyone looks to the same division when tuning the chromatic or the enharmonic, so why should the note a ditone from mesé be called lichanos rather than a small amount higher?" <ref name="barker163">Prof Andrew barker, (1989), ''Greek Musical Writings'', Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge University Press, pp. 163</ref>\u000a\u000aIt is sometimes claimed that the nature of Aristoxenus' scales and genera deviated sharply from his predecessors. That Aristoxenus used a model for creating scales based upon the notion of a topos, or range of pitch location,<ref name="barker140">Prof Andrew barker, (1989), ''Greek Musical Writings'', Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge University Press, pp. 140</ref> is fact, however there is no reason to believe that he alone set this precedent, as he himself does not make this claim. Indeed, the idea of unfixed pitch locations that cover certain ranges, the limits of which may be defined by fixed points, is a notion that was popular until the modern fixation upon fixed pitch systems, as is indicated by baroque theoretical systems of pitch and intonation.  Another way of stating this, however perhaps less accurate, is that instead of using discrete ratios to place intervals, he used continuously variable quantities.\u000a\u000aThe postulation that this resulted in the structuring of his tetrachords and the resulting scales having 'other' qualities of consonance <ref>John Chalmers, (1993) ''Divisions of the Tetrachord'', Chapter 3, pp. 17\u201322. Frog Peak Music. ISBN 0-945996-04-7.</ref> is one that can only be accounted for by the recourse to often repeated inconsistencies amongst his interpreters and modern confirmation bias in favour of simplified twelve tone theories. Aristoxenus himself held that "(...) two things must not be overlooked: first, that many people have mistakenly supposed us to be saying that a tone can be divided into three equal parts in a melody. They made this mistake because they did not realise that it is one thing to employ the third part of a tone, and another to divide a tone into three parts and sing all three. Secondly we accept that from a purely abstract point of view there is no least interval." <ref name="barker160">Prof Andrew barker, (1989), ''Greek Musical Writings'', Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge University Press, pp. 160</ref>\u000a\u000aIn book three Aristoxenus goes on to describe twenty eight laws of melodic succession, which are of great interest to those concerned with classical Greek melodic structure.<ref name="barker170">Prof Andrew barker, (1989), ''Greek Musical Writings'', Volume 2, Harmonic and Acoustic Theory, Cambridge University Press, pp. 170-183</ref>\u000a\u000a==On rhythmics and metrics==\u000aPart of the second book of a work on rhythmics and metrics, ''Elementa rhythmica'', is preserved in medieval manuscript tradition.\u000a\u000aAristoxenus was also the author of a work ''On the Primary Duration'' (''chronos'').\u000a\u000aA five-column fragment of a treatise on meter ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 9|P. Oxy. 9]]/[http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?e=q-000-00---0POxy--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about-2687--00031-001-0-0utfZz-8-00&a=d&c=POxy&cl=search&d=HASH0145fcb68270ba24d867ccd9 2687]) was published in [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell|Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Surridge Hunt|Hunt]]'s ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', vol. 1 (1898) and is probably by Aristoxenus.\u000a\u000a==Other
