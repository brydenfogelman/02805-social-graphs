His [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]] or [[Marxism-Leninism-Maoism]].\u000a\u000aBorn the son of a wealthy farmer in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]], Mao adopted a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at [[Peking University]] and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Guomindang]] (GMD) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the GMD under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u201345), after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's defeat]] China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government|Nationalists]] who withdrew to [[Taiwan]].\u000a\u000aOn October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), a [[one-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years Mao solidified his control through [[land reform]] campaigns against landlords, and perceived enemies of the state he termed as "[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]". In 1957, he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] economy to an [[Industrial society|industrial]] one. The campaign contributed to a [[Great Chinese Famine|widespread famine]], whose death toll is estimated at between 15 and 45 million. In 1966, he initiated the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove "counter-revolutionary" elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's [[personality cult]].<ref>"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the .

The only glitch in this plan came when Mao refused to follow the easy route into Sichuan where he was to meet up with a red army much larger than his own and led by a more senior CPC member, Chang Kuo Tao.

The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power. With the [[Soviet Union]]'s assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] in 1958.

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives which had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned; livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.\u000a\u000aUnder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.<ref name="Spence1999 p553">{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --></ref>\u000a\u000aIn an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them.

The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the largest [[famine]] known as the [[Great Chinese Famine]].

Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of "production at the expense of livelihood." While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.<ref name="wilfulness" /></blockquote>\u000a\u000aIn ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that [[rightists]] and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,<ref name="Becker81">{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}</ref> and instead launched a series of "anti-grain concealment" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}</ref> Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}</ref>\u000a\u000aWhatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres, was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and lost political power to moderate leaders, perhaps most notably [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.\u000a\u000aThe Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a"We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal."\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000aThe worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}</ref> As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:\u000a<blockquote>\u000a"The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers."''<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}</ref>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000aAt a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the "Conference of the Seven Thousand", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.<ref name="Chang">{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.<ref name="Chang"/> A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.<ref name="Chang"/> Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\u000a\u000a[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]\u000a\u000a===Consequences===\u000aAt the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as "right opportunists."<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92\u201393}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine.

Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name="Yang Jisheng"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name="Becker81"/>\u000a\u000aCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958\u201361, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million.

The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as "revisionists" and listed alongside "American imperialism" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\u000a\u000aPartly surrounded by hostile American military bases (in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]]), China was now confronted with a new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat from the north and west.

He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the "ruling class" and keep China in a state of "perpetual revolution" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged [[elite]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution.

Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966.

During the Cultural Revolution, nearly all of the schools and universities in China were closed and the young intellectuals living in cities were ordered to the countryside to be "re-educated" by the peasants, where they performed hard manual labour and other work.\u000a\u000aThe Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as the creation of general economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese life, depicted by such Chinese films as ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name="maostats">{{cite web|url= http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao |title= Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm |publisher= Historical Atlas of the Twentieth Century |accessdate= August 23, 2008 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aWhen Mao was informed of such losses, particularly that people had been driven to suicide, he is alleged to have commented: "People who try to commit suicide&nbsp;\u2014 don't attempt to save them!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however, a divide between the two men became apparent. Official history in China states that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin Biao died in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao, and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures. The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] described his conversation with [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] who told him about a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organised by the [[KGB]].<ref name="Pacepa0">{{cite web|url= http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ= |title= The Kremlin's Killing Ways |author= Ion Mihai Pacepa |work= National Review |date= November 28, 2006 |accessdate= August 23, 2008 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aDespite being considered a [[feminist]] figure by some and a supporter of women's rights, documents released by the [[US Department of State]] in 2008 show that Mao declared women to be a "nonsense" in 1973, in conversation with Kissinger, joking that "China is a very poor country.

More replica mangoes were created and the replicas were sent on tour around Beijing and elsewhere in China.

Supporters generally credit and praise him for having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also credited for having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education.  His policies caused the deaths of tens of millions of people in China during his 27-year reign, more than any other Twentieth Century leader; the number of people who died under his regime range from 40 million to as many as 70 million. However, supporters point out that in spite of this, life expectancy improved during his reign. His supporters claim that he rapidly industrialised China; however, others have claimed that his policies such as the "Great Leap Forward" and the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution", were impediments to industrialisation and modernisation. His supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China's later rise to become an economic superpower, while others claim that his policies delayed economic development and that China's economy only underwent its rapid growth only after Mao's policies had been widely abandoned.  Mao's revolutionary tactics continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many Communist organizations around the world.\u000a\u000aIn mainland China, Mao is still revered by many members and supporters of the Communist Party and respected by the majority of the general population as the "[[List of national founders|Founding Father]] of modern China", credited for giving "the Chinese people dignity and self-respect."<ref name="Biography 2005">[[Biography (TV series)]] [http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi3081083673/ Mao Tse Tung: China's Peasant Emperor] [[A&E Network]] 2005, ASIN B000AABKXG {{time needed|date=January 2013}}</ref> Mobo Gao in his 2008 book ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'', credits Mao for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing "unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions", and laying the foundation for China to "become the equal of the great global powers".<ref name = "MoboGao" /> Gao also lauds Mao for carrying out massive [[land reform]], promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively "transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition."<ref name = "MoboGao">{{Harvnb|Gao|2008|p=81}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHowever, Mao has many Chinese critics, both those who live inside and outside China. Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction and censorship in mainland China, but is especially strong elsewhere, where he is often reviled as a brutish ideologue. In the West, his name is generally associated with tyranny and his economic theories are widely discredited\u2014though to some political activists he remains a symbol against [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and western influence. Even in China, key pillars of his economic theory have been largely dismantled by market reformers like [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]], who succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party.\u000a[[File:Mao Zedong youth art sculpture 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of young Mao in [[Changsha]], the capital of [[Hunan]]]]\u000a\u000aThough the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which Mao led to power, has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao's ideology, it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao's reign: it controls the Chinese army, police, courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or local level, except in Hong Kong.

Mao then pointed to the example of Guangxi provincial Party secretary, Chén Mànyu\u01cen (\u9673\u6f2b\u9060) who had been dismissed in 1957 for failing to prevent famine in the previous year, adding: "If with a death toll of 50 million you didn't lose your jobs, I at least should lose mine; whether I should lose my head would also be in question.
