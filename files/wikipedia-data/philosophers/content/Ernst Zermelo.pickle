He is known for his role in developing [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axiomatic set theory]] and his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000a[[File:Ernst Zermelo.jpeg|thumb|Ernst Zermelo in Freiburg (1953)]]\u000aErnst Zermelo graduated from Berlin's Luisenstädtisches Gymnasium (now {{ill|de|Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule|Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule (Gymnasium)|Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule}}) in 1889. He then studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] at the universities of [[Berlin]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Freiburg]]. He finished his doctorate in 1894 at the [[University of Berlin]], awarded for a dissertation on the [[calculus of variations]] (''Untersuchungen zur Variationsrechnung''). Zermelo remained at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed assistant to [[Max Planck|Planck]], under whose guidance he began to study [[hydrodynamics]]. In 1897, Zermelo went to [[Göttingen]], at that time the leading centre for mathematical research in the world, where he completed his [[habilitation thesis]] in 1899.\u000a\u000aIn 1910, Zermelo left Göttingen upon being appointed to the chair of mathematics at [[University of Zurich|Zurich University]], which he resigned in 1916.\u000aHe was appointed to an honorary chair at [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] in 1926, which he resigned in 1935 because he disapproved of Adolf Hitler's regime. At the end of [[World War II]] and at his request, Zermelo was reinstated to his honorary position in Freiburg.\u000a\u000a==Research in set theory==\u000a\u000aIn 1900, in the Paris conference of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] challenged the mathematical community with his famous [[Hilbert's problems]], a list of 23 unsolved fundamental questions which mathematicians should attack during the coming century. The first of these, a problem of [[set theory]], was the [[continuum hypothesis]] introduced by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in 1878, and in the course of its statement Hilbert mentioned also the need to prove the [[well-ordering theorem]].\u000a\u000aZermelo began to work on the problems of set theory under Hilbert's influence and in 1902 published his first work concerning the addition of [[Cardinal numbers|transfinite cardinals]]. By that time he had also discovered the so-called [[Russell paradox]]. In 1904, he succeeded in taking the first step suggested by Hilbert towards the continuum hypothesis when he proved the [[well-ordering theorem]] (''every set can be well ordered''). This result brought fame to Zermelo, who was appointed Professor in Göttingen, in 1905. His proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]], based on the powerset axiom and the [[axiom of choice]], was not accepted by all mathematicians, mostly because the axiom of choice was a paradigm of non-constructive mathematics. In 1908, Zermelo succeeded in producing an improved proof making use of Dedekind's notion of the "chain" of a set, which became more widely accepted; this was mainly because that same year he also offered an [[axiomatization]] of set theory.\u000a\u000aZermelo began to axiomatize set theory in 1905; in 1908, he published his results despite his failure to prove the consistency of his axiomatic system. See the article on [[Zermelo set theory]] for an outline of this paper, together with the original axioms, with the original numbering.\u000a\u000aIn 1922, [[Adolf Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently improved Zermelo's axiom system. The resulting 8 axiom system, now called [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]] (ZF), is now the most commonly used system for [[axiomatic set theory]].\u000a==An Amusing Anecdote==\u000aWhen Zermelo was dying in his hospital bed, in Freiburg, a group of logicians visited him. They decided that he should be told the bad news about his well-ordering theorem. Even Dedekind's chain condition needed the axiom of choice to prove well-ordering, and Zermelo's results on the well-ordering principle did not reduce the dependence on that axiom. They appointed Bertrand Russell to tell him the bad news, and he agreed. But then he changed his mind and said "Let him die happy."\u000a\u000a==Zermelo's navigation problem==\u000aProposed in 1931, the [[Zermelo's navigation problem]] is a classic [[optimal control]] problem. The problem deals with a boat navigating on a body of water, originating from a point O to a destination point D. The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and we want to derive the best possible control to reach D in the least possible time.\u000a\u000aWithout considering external forces such as current and wind, the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards D. Its path then is a line segment from O to D, which is trivially optimal. With consideration of current and wind, if the combined force applied to the boat is non-zero the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path.\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000aPrimary literature in English translation:\u000a*[[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967.
