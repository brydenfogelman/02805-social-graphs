During [[World War II]] he worked on radio intercept equipment at [[Hanslope Park]], where Alan Turing was working on a speech [[encipherment]] project, and he became one of Turing's lifelong friends and associates. In 1946, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, then began studying for a PhD under Turing's supervision. He completed his thesis, ''On axiomatic systems in mathematics and theories in Physics'', in 1952. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]].\u000a\u000aGandy held positions at the Universities of [[University of Leicester|Leicester]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], and [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Manchester]]. Gandy was a visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] from 1966 to 1967, and held a similar position at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1968. In 1969, he moved to [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], where he became [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Mathematical Logic. One of the residential buildings of the college is now named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://secure.flickr.com/photos/stommy/2502650192/ | title=Robin Gandy Buildings, Wolfson | publisher=[[Flickr]] | accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHe is best known for his work in [[recursion theory]].
