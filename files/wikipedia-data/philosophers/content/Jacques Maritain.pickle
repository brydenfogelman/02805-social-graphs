Raised as a [[Protestant]], he became an agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books, he helped to revive St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] for modern times, and was influential in the development and drafting of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] presented his "Message to Men of Thought and of Science" at the close of [[Vatican II]] to Maritain, his long-time friend and mentor. Maritain's interest and works spanned many aspects of [[philosophy]], including [[aesthetics]], [[political theory]], [[philosophy of science]], [[metaphysics]], the nature of [[education]], [[liturgy]] and [[ecclesiology]].\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aMaritain was born in Paris, the son of Paul Maritain, who was a lawyer, and his wife Geneviève Favre, the daughter of [[Jules Favre]], and was reared in a liberal Protestant milieu. He was sent to the [[Lycée Henri-IV]]. Later, he attended the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], studying the natural sciences: chemistry, biology and physics.\u000a\u000aAt the Sorbonne, he met [[Raïssa Maritain|Raïssa Oumançoff]], a [[Russia]]n Jewish émigré. They married in 1904. A noted poet and mystic, she participated as his intellectual partner in his search for [[truth]]. Raissa's sister, Vera Oumançoff, lived with Jacques and Raissa for almost all their married life.\u000a\u000aAt the Sorbonne, Jacques and Raïssa soon became disenchanted with [[scientism]], which could not, in their view, address the larger existential issues of life. In 1901, in light of this disillusionment, they made a pact to commit suicide together if they could not discover some deeper meaning to life within a year. They were spared from following through on this because, at the urging of [[Charles Péguy]], they attended the lectures of [[Henri Bergson]] at the [[Collège de France]]. Bergson's critique of scientism dissolved their intellectual despair and instilled in them "the sense of the absolute." Then, through the influence of [[Léon Bloy]], they converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1906.\u000a\u000aIn the fall of 1907 the Maritains moved to [[Heidelberg]], where Jacques studied biology under [[Hans Driesch]]. Hans Driesch\u2019s theory of neo-vitalism attracted Jacques because of its affinity with Henri Bergson. During this time, Raïssa fell ill, and during her convalescence, their [[spirtuality|spiritual]] advisor, a [[Dominican friar]] named Fr. Humbert Clérissac, introduced her to the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. She read them with enthusiasm and, in turn, exhorted her husband to examine the saint\u2019s writings. In Thomas, Maritain found a number of insights and ideas that he had believed all along. He wrote:\u000a<blockquote>"Thenceforth, in affirming to myself, without chicanery or diminution, the authentic value of the reality of our human instruments of knowledge, I was already a Thomist without knowing it...When several months later I came to the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', I would construct no impediment to its luminous flood."</blockquote>\u000a\u000aFrom the Angelic Doctor (the honorary title of St. Aquinas), he was led to "The Philosopher", as St. Thomas called [[Aristotle]]. Still later, to further his intellectual development, he read the neo-scholastics.\u000a\u000aBeginning in 1912, Maritain taught at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]]. He later moved to the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]]. For the 1916\u20131917 academic year, he taught at the [[Petit Séminaire de Versailles]]. As an internationally renowned, Maritain was first, along with [[Étienne Gilson]], to receive an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in 1930.<ref>Piero Viotto, ''Grandi amicizie: i Maritain e i loro contemporanei'', 38, https://books.google.com/books?id=aonOg8KLOdIC&pg=PA38 Accessed 28 February 2016. Jean Leclercq, ''Di grazia in grazia: memorie'', 60. https://books.google.com/books?id=jxKnMfTj81AC&pg=PA60 Accessed 28 February 2016</ref> In 1933, he gave his first lectures in North America in [[Toronto]] at the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]]. He also taught at [[Columbia University]]; at the Committee on Social Thought, [[University of Chicago]]; at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and at [[Princeton University]].\u000a\u000aFrom 1945 to 1948, he was the French ambassador to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].\u000a\u000aAfterwards, he returned to Princeton University where he achieved the "Elysian status" (as he put it) of a professor emeritus in 1956. Raissa Maritain died in 1960. After her death, Jacques published her journal under the title "Raissa's Journal." For several years Maritain was an honorary chairman of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], appearing as a keynote speaker at its 1960 conference in Berlin.<ref>[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/What-was-the-Congress-for-Cultural-Freedom--5597 Hilton Kramer, "What was the Congress for Cultural Freedom?"  ''The New Criterion'', Volume 8, January 1990, page 7, January 1990.]</ref>\u000aFrom 1961, Maritain lived with the [[Little Brothers of Jesus]] in Toulouse, France. He had had an influence on the order since its foundation in 1933. He became a Little Brother in 1970.\u000a\u000aJacques and Raïssa Maritain are buried in the cemetery of [[Kolbsheim]], a little French village in [[Alsace]] where he had spent many summers at the estate of his friends, Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius.<ref>The most comprehensive biography of the Maritians is: Jean-Luc Barre, "Jacques And Raissa Maritain: Beggars For Heaven", University of Notre Dame Press.</ref>\u000a\u000aA cause for [[beatification]] of him and his wife Raissa is being planned.<ref>{{YouTube|KRbxS5FfAf0|Beatification process for Jacques and Raissa Maritain could begin}} (8 February 2011)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000aThe foundation of Maritain\u2019s thought is Aristotle, St. Thomas and the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] commentators, especially [[John of St. Thomas]]. He is eclectic in his use of these sources. Maritain\u2019s philosophy is based on evidence accrued by the senses and acquired by an understanding of first principles. Maritain defended [[philosophy]] as a science against those who would degrade it and promoted philosophy as the "queen of sciences".\u000a\u000aIn 1910, Jacques Maritain completed his first contribution to modern philosophy, a 28-page article titled, "Reason and Modern Science" published in ''Revue de Philosophie'' (June issue). In it, he warned that science was becoming a divinity, its methodology usurping the role of reason and philosophy. Science was supplanting the humanities in importance.\u000a\u000aIn 1917, a committee of French bishops commissioned Jacques to write a series of textbooks to be used in Catholic colleges and seminaries. He wrote and completed only one of these projects, titled ''Elements de Philosophie'' (Introduction of Philosophy) in 1920. It has been a standard text ever since in many Catholic seminaries. He wrote in his introduction:\u000a<blockquote>"If the philosophy of Aristotle, as revived and enriched by [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas]] and his school, may rightly be called the [[Christian philosophy]], both because the church is never weary of putting it forward as the only true philosophy and because it harmonizes perfectly with the truths of faith, nevertheless it is proposed here for the reader's acceptance not because it is Christian, but because it is demonstrably true. This agreement between a philosophic system founded by a pagan and the dogmas of revelation is no doubt an external sign, an extra-philosophic guarantee of its truth; but from its own rational evidence, that it derives its authority as a philosophy".</blockquote>\u000a\u000aDuring World War II, Jacques Maritain protested the policies of the [[Vichy]] government while teaching at the Pontifical Institute for Medieval Studies in Canada. "Moving to New York, Maritain became deeply involved in rescue activities, seeking to bring persecuted and threatened academics, many of them Jews, to America. He was instrumental in founding the [[École Libre des Hautes Études]], a kind of university in exile that was, at the same time, the center of Gaullist resistance in the United States". (1) After the war, he tried unsuccessfully to have the [[Pope]]{{clarify|reason=which pope? Probably Pius XII, but I'd rather not guess|date=April 2014}} speak on the issue of [[anti-semitism]] and the evils of [[the Holocaust]].<ref>Richard Francis Crane, "Heart-Rending Ambivalence: Jacques Maritain and the Complexity of Postwar Catholic Philosemitism," ''Studies in Christian-Jewish Relations'' 6 (2011) http://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/scjr/article/view/1820/1698</ref>\u000a\u000aMany of his American papers are held by the [[University of Notre Dame]], which established [[The Jacques Maritain Center]] in 1957. The Cercle d'Etudes Jacques & Raïssa Maritain is an association founded by the philosopher himself in 1962 in Kolbsheim (near [[Strasbourg]], France), where the couple is also buried. The purpose of these centers is to encourage study and research of Maritain\u2019s thought and expand upon them. It is also absorbed in translating and editing his writings.\u000a\u000a==Metaphysics and epistemology==\u000aMaritain's philosophy is based on the view that [[metaphysics]] is prior to [[epistemology]]. Being is first apprehended implicitly in [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and is known in two ways. First, being is known reflexively by abstraction from sense experience. One experiences a particular being, e.g. a cup, a dog, etc. and through reflexion ("bending back") on the judgement, e.g. "this is a dog", one recognizes that the object in question is an existent. Second, in light of attaining being reflexively through apprehension of sense experience one may arrive at what Maritain calls "an Intuition of Being". For Maritain this is the point of departure for metaphysics; without the intuition of being one cannot be a metaphysician at all. The intuition of being involves rising to the apprehension of ''ens secundum quod est ens'' (being insofar as it is a being). In ''Existence and the Existent'' he explains:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>"It is being, attained or perceived at the summit of an abstractive intellection, of an eidetic or intensive visualization which owes its purity and power of illumination only to the fact that the intellect, one day, was stirred to its depths and trans-illuminated by the impact of the act of existing apprehended in things, and because it was quickened to the point of receiving this act, or hearkening to it, within itself, in the intelligible and super-intelligible integrity of the tone particular to it." (p. 20)</blockquote>\u000a\u000aIn view of this priority given to metaphysics, Maritain advocates an epistemology he calls "Critical Realism". Maritain's epistemology is not "critical" in Kant's sense, which held that one could only know anything after undertaking a thorough critique of one's cognitive abilities. Rather, it is critical in the sense that it is not a naive or non-philosophical realism, but one that is defended by way of reason. Against Kant's critical project Maritain argues that epistemology is reflexive; you can only defend a theory of knowledge in light of knowledge you have already attained. Consequently, the critical question is not the question of modern philosophy{{spaced ndash}}how do we pass from what is perceived to what is. Rather, "Since the mind, from the very start, reveals itself as warranted in its certitude by things and measured by an esse{{clarify|reason=while this word exists in my dictionary, I still have no idea of what work it does for this sentence|date=April 2014}} independent of itself, how are we to judge if, how, on what conditions, and to what extent it is so both in principle and in the various moments of knowledge?"\u000a\u000aIn contrast idealism inevitably ends up in contradiction, since it does not recognize the universal scope of the first principles of identity, contradiction, and finality. These become merely laws of thought or language, but not of being, which opens the way to contradictions being instantiated in reality.\u000a\u000aMaritain's metaphysics ascends from this account of being to a critique of the philosophical aspects of modern science, through analogy to an account of the existence and nature of God as it is known philosophically and through mystical experience.\u000a\u000a==Ethics==\u000aMaritain was a strong defender of a natural law ethics. He viewed ethical norms as being rooted in human nature. For Maritain the natural law is known primarily, not through philosophical argument and demonstration, but rather through "Connaturality". Connatural knowledge is a kind of knowledge by acquaintance. We know the natural law through our direct acquaintance with it in our human experience. Of central importance, is Maritain's argument that natural rights are rooted in the natural law. This was key to his involvement in the drafting of the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].\u000a\u000aAnother important aspect of his ethics was his insistence upon the need for moral philosophy to be conducted in a theological context. While a Christian could engage in speculative thought about nature or metaphysics in a purely rational manner and develop an adequate philosophy of nature of metaphysics, this is not possible with ethics. Moral philosophy must address the actual state of the human person, and this is a person in a state of grace. Thus, "moral philosophy adequately considered" must take into account properly theological truths. It would be impossible, for instance, to develop an adequate moral philosophy without giving consideration to properly theological facts such as original sin and the supernatural end of the human person in beatitude. Any moral philosophy that does not take into account these realities that are only known through faith would be fundamentally incomplete.<ref>Maritain, An Essay on Christian Philosophy, (NY: Philosophical Library, 1955), pp. 38 ff.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Political theory==\u000aMaritain advocated what he called "Integral Humanism."  He argued that secular forms of humanism were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person. Once the spiritual dimension of human nature is rejected, we no longer have an integral, but merely partial, humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in ''Integral Humanism'' he explores the prospects for a new [[Christendom]], rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways Christianity could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. Maritain's political theory was extremely influential, and was a primary source behind the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic movement]].\u000a\u000aMaritain also corresponded with, and was a friend of<ref>[http://www.cssronline.org/CSSR/Current/Articles%20-%20Wolfe.pdf  Wolfe, C.J. \u201cLessons from the Friendship of Jacques Maritain with Saul Alinsky\u201d he Catholic Social Science Review 16 (2011): 229-240]</ref> the American radical [[Community organizing|community organizer]] [[Saul Alinsky]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Thomistic Papers|volume=3|chapter=Jacques Maritain and His Two Authentic Revolutionaries|pages=91\u2013116|location=Houston, Tex.|publisher=[[Center for Catholic Studies (University of St. Thomas)|Center for Thomistic Studies]]|editor-last=Kennedy|editor-first=Leonard A|last=Doering|first=Bernard E.|oclc=17307550|year=1987|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/modernism/Maritain%20and%20His%20Two%20Authentic%20Revolutionaries%20(Thomistic%20Papers%20III.).pdf|isbn=0-268-01865-0}}</ref> and French Prime Minister [[Robert Schuman]].<ref name="Fimister">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZ7ncyFsEGMC&lpg=PA131&dq=%22jacques%20maritain%20is%20considered%20a%20heretic%22&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q=%22Jacques%20Maritain%20is%20considered%20a%20heretic.%22&f=false|title=Robert Schuman: Neo-Scholastic Humanism and the Reunification of Europe|last=Fimister|first=Alan Paul|year=2008|oclc=244339575|isbn=978-90-5201-439-5|pages=131}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Criticism===\u000aMajor criticisms of Maritain have included: \u000a#An overdependence upon late scholastic commentators at the expense of fidelity to Aquinas' own text.
