He is a leading figure in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] where he defends a version of [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structuralism]]. He studied [[Mathematics]] and [[Philosophy]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1973. Then, he got his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Mathematics at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] in 1975. He transferred to the UB Philosophy Department, where three years later he received a Ph.D. His doctoral supervisor was [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]].\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000a* ''Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology''.
