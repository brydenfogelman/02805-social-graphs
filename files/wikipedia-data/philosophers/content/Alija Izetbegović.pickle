Izetbegovi\u0107 was further accused of organizing a visit to a Muslim congress in [[Iran]]. All of those tried were convicted and Izetbegovi\u0107 was sentenced to fourteen years in prison. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\u000a\u000aThe [[verdict]] was strongly criticised by Western human rights organisations, including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch|Helsinki Watch]], which claimed that the case was based on "communist propaganda", and the accused were not charged with either using or advocating violence. The following May, the Bosnian Supreme Court conceded the point with an announcement that "''some of the actions of the accused did not have the characteristics of criminal acts''" and reduced Izetbegovi\u0107's sentence to twelve years. In 1988, as communist rule faltered, he was pardoned and released after almost five years in prison. His health had suffered serious damage.<ref name="Ned\u017ead Lati\u0107, Boja povijesti"/>\u000a\u000a==Presidency==\u000aThe introduction of a multi-party system in [[Yugoslavia]] at the end of the 1980s prompted Izetbegovi\u0107 and other Bosniak activists to establish a political party, the [[Party of Democratic Action]] (''Stranka Demokratske Akcije'', SDA) in 1989. It had a largely Muslim character; similarly, the other principal ethnic groups in Bosnia, the Serbs and Croats, also established ethnically based parties. (The Communist Party renamed itself the Party of Democratic Changes.) The SDA won the largest share of the vote, 33% of the seats, with the next runners-up being nationalist ethnic parties representing Serbs and Croats. [[Fikret Abdi\u0107]] won the popular vote for Presidency member among the Bosniak candidates, with 44% of the vote, Izetbegovi\u0107 with 37%. According to the Bosnian constitution, the first two candidates of each of the ''three constitutient nations'' would be elected to a seven-member multi-ethnic rotating presidency (with two Croats, two Serbs, two [[Bosniaks]] and one Yugoslav); a Croat took the post of prime minister and a Serb the presidency of the Assembly. Abdi\u0107 agreed to stand down as the Bosniak candidate for the Presidency and Izetbegovi\u0107 became Chairman of the Presidency. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\u000a\u000aBosnia's power-sharing arrangements broke down very quickly as ethnic tensions grew after the outbreak of fighting between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] in neighboring [[Croatia]]. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 was due to hold the presidency for only one year according to the constitution, this arrangement was initially suspended due to "extraordinary circumstances" and was eventually abandoned altogether during the war as the Serb and Croat nationalistic parties SDS and HDZ abandoned the government. When fighting broke out in [[Slovenia]] and Croatia in the summer of 1991, it was immediately apparent that Bosnia would soon become embroiled in the conflict. Izetbegovi\u0107 initially proposed a loose confederation to preserve a unitary Bosnian state and strongly urged a peaceful solution. He did not subscribe to the ''peace at all costs'' view and commented in February 1991 that ''I would sacrifice peace for a sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina&nbsp;... but for that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina I would not sacrifice sovereignty.'' He abandoned the [[Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107\u2013Karad\u017ei\u0107 agreement]] which would see BiH as a sovereign state in a confederation with Serbia and Montenegro, with 60% of [[Sand\u017eak]] ceded to BiH.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jasminka Udovicki|author2=James Ridgeway|title=Burn This House: The Making and Unmaking of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuGe9fy4raoC&pg=PA204|date=31 October 2000|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2590-X|pages=204\u2013}}</ref> By the start of 1992 it had become apparent that the rival nationalist demands were fundamentally incompatible: the Bosniaks and Croats sought an independent Bosnia while the Serbs wanted it to remain in a rump Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. Izetbegovi\u0107 publicly complained that he was being forced to ally with one side or the other, vividly characterising the dilemma by comparing it to having to choose between [[leukaemia]] and a brain tumour.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LZMp9ZfGfMUC&pg=PA174&dq=Izetbegovic+leukaemia+and+a+brain+tumour ''After the Peace'' by Robert L.

Initially, all three sides signed up to the agreement; Izetbegovi\u0107 for the Bosniaks, [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]] for the Serbs and [[Mate Boban]] for the Croats. Some two weeks later, however, Izetbegovi\u0107 withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any type of [[partition of Bosnia]], supposedly encouraged by [[Warren Zimmermann]], the [[United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia]] at the time.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=es267LuAcAA YouTube]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Bosnian War==\u000a{{Main article|Bosnian War}}\u000aIn February 1992, Izetbegovi\u0107 called an [[independence referendum]] on the European condition{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|p=99}} for recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state, despite warnings from the Serb members of the presidency that it was unconstitutional{{sfn|Lauterpacht|Greenwood|1999|pp=140\u2013141}} and that any move towards independence would result in the [[Serb Autonomous Regions|Serb-inhabited areas]] seceding to remain with the [[Serbia and Montenegro|rump Yugoslavia]]. [[Bosnian independence referendum, 1992|The referendum]] achieved a 99.4% vote in favour on a 67% turnout,{{sfn|CSCE|12 March 1992}} largely boycotted by the Serbs.{{sfn|Nettelfield|2010|p=67}}\u000a\u000aThe Bosnian parliament, already vacated by the Bosnian Serbs, formally declared independence from Yugoslavia on 29 February and Izetbegovi\u0107 announced the country's independence on 3 March. It did not take effect until 7 April 1992, when the [[European Union]] and United States recognised the new country. Sporadic fighting between Serbs and government forces occurred across Bosnia in the run-up to international recognition. Izetbegovi\u0107 appears to have gambled that the international community would send a peacekeeping force upon recognising Bosnia in order to prevent a war, but this did not happen. Instead, war immediately broke out across the country as Serb and Yugoslav Army forces took control of large areas against the poorly-equipped government security forces. Initially, Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces systematically ransacked or burnt down Bosniak houses and apartments, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, including also being raped repeatedly by Serb soldiers or policemen.<ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kova\u010d and Vukovi\u0107 judgement - Fo\u010da">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219012918/http://un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm |archivedate=19 February 2009 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aIzetbegovi\u0107 consistently promoted the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia under central control, which seemed a hopeless strategy under the circumstances. The Bosnian Croats, disillusioned with the Sarajevo government and supported militarily and financially by the Croatian government, increasingly turned to establishing their own ethnically-based state of ''[[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]]'' in [[Herzegovina]] and Central Bosnia. The Croats pulled out of the Sarajevo government and [[Croat\u2013Bosniak War|fighting broke out in 1993]]. In some areas local armistices were signed between the Serbs and Croats.

He denounced the failure of Western countries to reverse Serbian ''aggression'' and turned instead to the Muslim world, with which he had already established relations during his days as a dissident. The Bosnian government received money and arms. Following massacres on Bosnian Muslims by Serb and, to a lesser extent, Croat forces, foreign Muslim volunteers joined the Bosnian Army in the so-called [[Bosnian mujahideen]], numbering between 300 and 1,500.<ref name="SENSE tribunal">SENSE Tribunal:ICTY \u2013 WE FOUGHT WITH THE BH ARMY, BUT NOT UNDER ITS COMMAND [http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&pid=10225&kat=3]</ref> They quickly attracted heavy criticism amplified by Serbian and Croatian propaganda, who considered their presence to be evidence of ''violent Islamic fundamentalism'' at the heart of Europe. However, the foreign volunteers became unpopular even with many of the Bosniak population, because the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian army]] had thousands of troops and no need for more soldiers, but for arms. Many Bosnian Army officers and intellectuals were suspicious regarding foreign volunteers arrival in central part of the country, because they came from [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]] in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed Herzeg-Bosnia unlike Bosnian Army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. According to general [[Stjepan \u0160iber]], the highest ranking ethnic Croat in Bosnian Army, the key role in foreign volunteers arrival was played by [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] and Croatian [[counter-intelligence]] underground with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and mass crimes committed by Croat forces. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world's support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islam.co.ba/razmisljanja/index.php?subaction=ostalo&id=1070747643|title=Predrag Matvejevi\u0107 analysis}} {{dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1993, Izetbegovi\u0107 agreed to a peace plan that would divide Bosnia along ethnic lines but continued to insist on a unitary Bosnia government from Sarajevo and on the allocation to the Bosniaks of a large percentage of Bosnia's territory. The war between the Bosniaks and Croats was eventually ended by a truce brokered with the aid of the Americans in March 1994, following which the two sides collaborated more closely against the Serbs. [[NATO]] then became increasingly involved in the conflict with occasional "pinprick" bombings conducted against the Bosnian Serbs, generally following violations of ceasefires and the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The Bosnian Croat forces benefited indirectly from the American military training given to the Croatian Army. In addition, the Croatians provided considerable quantities of weaponry to the Bosnian Croats and much smaller amounts to the Bosnian Army, despite a UN weapons [[embargo]]. Most of the Bosnian Army's supply of weapons was air-lifted from the Muslim world, specifically Iran \u2013 an issue which became the subject of some controversy and a US congressional investigation in 1996. In September 1993, the Second Bosniak Congress officially re-introduced the historical ethnic name Bosniaks.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The Yugoslav "[[Muslim by nationality]]" policy was considered by Bosniaks to be neglecting and opposing their Bosnian identity because the term tried to describe Bosniaks as a religious group not an ethnic one.<ref name="Imamovic">Historija Bo\u0161njaka by Mustafa Imamovi\u0107 (1996), Sarajevo: BZK Preporod; ISBN 9958-815-00-1</ref>\u000a\u000a==Ending the war==\u000a[[File:President Clinton meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Tuzla, Bosnia - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|US President [[Bill Clinton]] meeting with Izetbegovic in Tuzla, Bosnia, 1997]]\u000a\u000aIn August 1995, following the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and the [[Markale massacres#Second massacre|2nd Markale massacre]], [[NATO]] launched [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|intensive bombing campaign]] which destroyed Bosnian Serb command and control system.

The offensive came to a halt not far from the ''de facto'' Serb capital of [[Banja Luka]]. When the Croat and Bosniak forces stopped their advance they had captured the power plants supplying Banja Luka's electricity and used that control to pressure the Serb leadership into accepting a ceasefire. The parties agreed to meet at [[Dayton, Ohio]] to negotiate a peace treaty under the supervision of the United States.

His party's power declined after the international community installed a [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] to oversee affairs of state, with more power than the Presidency or parliaments of either the Bosniak-Croat or Serb entities. He stepped down in October 2000 at the age of 74, citing his bad health. However, Izetbegovi\u0107 remained popular with the Bosniak public, who nicknamed him ''Dedo'' (which in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] means ''[[grandparent|grandfather]]''). His endorsement helped his party to bounce back in the 2002 elections. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\u000a\u000a==Death==\u000aHe died in October 2003 of [[heart disease]] complicated by injuries suffered from a fall at home.
