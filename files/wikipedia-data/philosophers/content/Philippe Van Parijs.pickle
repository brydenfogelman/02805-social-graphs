Van Parijs asserts that it promotes the achievement of a [[real freedom]] to make choices. For example, he purports that one cannot really choose to stay at home to raise children or start a business if one cannot afford to. As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of [[income redistribution]].\u000a\u000aAnother part of Van Parijs' work is about linguistic justice. In order to address the injustice arising from the privilege enjoyed by English as a global lingua franca, he discusses a wide range of measures such as a [[language tax]]<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_122_%28PVP%29.pdf Europe's three language problems], Multilingualism in Law and Politics</ref> which would be paid by English-speaking countries, a ban on the dubbing of films, and the enforcement of a linguistic territoriality principle that would protect weaker languages.<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/linguistic-justice-for-europe-and-for-the-world-9780199208876 Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011.</ref>\u000a\u000aVan Parijs's work is sometimes associated with the [[September Group]] of [[analytic Marxism]], though he is not himself a committed Marxist.\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a<references />\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a* [http://www.uclouvain.be/en-11688.html Personal homepage]\u000a* [http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plcdib/imprints/vanparijsinterview.html "The Need for Basic Income"], interview with [[Chris Bertram]], ''Imprints'', vol. 1, no. 3 (March 1997)\u000a*[http://www.europeandme.eu/17brain/952-unconditional-basic-income No conditions attached], interview by the magazine ''Europe & Me'', July 2012\u000a\u000a{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\u000a{{September group}}\u000a{{Basic income}}\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Van Parijs, Philippe}}\u000a[[Category:1951 births]]\u000a[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:21st-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Basic income proponents]]\u000a[[Category:Belgian economists]]\u000a[[Category:Belgian philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Belgian political theorists]]\u000a[[Category:European University Institute faculty]]\u000a[[Category:Harvard University staff]]\u000a[[Category:Left-libertarians]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a[[Category:Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]
