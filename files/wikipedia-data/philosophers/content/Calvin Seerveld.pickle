V'''Calvin Seerveld''' (born 1930 in [[New York City|New York]]) received a BA from Calvin College in 1952, an MA in English literature and classics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1953.  He then went on to study under [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]] (VU) in [[Amsterdam]], where his doctoral dissertation dealt with Croce's [[aesthetics]].  It was supervised by Vollenhoven and Carlo Antoni.  He then taught philosophy and German at [[Trinity Christian College]], and went on to teach philosophical aesthetics at the [[Institute for Christian Studies]] in [[Toronto]].\u000a\u000aSeerveld has been influential in the [[reformational philosophy|reformational movement]]. In fact he was the first to coin the term 'reformational' to describe the philosophical aspects of neo-Calvinism.  He has taken [[Herman Dooyeweerd|Dooyeweerd's]] aesthetic modal aspect and developed Dooyeweerd's ideas {{Clarify|date=December 2011}}.  His book ''Rainbows for a Fallen World'' has influenced many Christian artists {{according to whom|date=December 2011}}.  In it he argues that "aesthetic obedience is required of everyone by the Lord-artist or not."<sup>2</sup>\u000a\u000aLambert Zuidervaart identifies four claims that constitute Seerveld's contribution to aesthetics<sup>1</sup>:\u000a* The aesthetic is part of the fabric of created reality, and aesthetic norms can be violated or ignored only at great cost.\u000a* The arts, despite their variety and their continuing development, are a unified sphere distinct from other spheres of cultural endeavour, offering opportunities for vocational service to Christians today.\u000a* The aesthetic is not limited only to the arts, just as the arts have many facets other than the aesthetic.\u000a* The core meaning of the aesthetic - and distinguishing characteristic of the arts - is 'allusiveness' or 'imaginativity'.\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000a*''Rainbows for a Fallen World'' Tuppence Press, 1980\u000a*''On Being Human: Imaging God in a Modern World'' Welch Publishing, 1998\u000a*''Take Hold of God and Pull'' Paternoster, 1999\u000a*''In the Fields of the Lord: A Calvin Seerveld Reader''  Craig Bartholomew (Editor) Piquant/ Tuppence Press, 2000.\u000a*''Voicing God's Psalms'' Eerdmans, 2005\u000a[http://www.seerveld.com/tuppence.html All available from Tuppence Press]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a<sup>1</sup> In Zuidervaart and Luttikhuizen (ed.)
