He rose to prominence through his work as a journalist, publishing works critical of the [[British Raj]] and espousing the causes of [[Indian nationalism]]. Azad became the leader of the [[Khilafat Movement]], during which he came into close contact with the Indian leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Azad became an enthusiastic supporter of Gandhi's ideas of non-violent [[civil disobedience]], and worked to organise the [[Non-Cooperation Movement|non-co-operation movement]] in protest of the 1919 [[Rowlatt Acts]]. Azad committed himself to Gandhi's ideals, including promoting ''[[Swadeshi]]'' (indigenous) products and the cause of ''[[Swaraj]]'' (''Self-rule'') for [[India]]. In 1923, at an age of 35, he became the youngest person to serve as the [[Congress President|President]] of the [[Indian National Congress]].\u000a\u000aAzad was one of the main organisers of the [[Dharasana Satyagraha]] in 1931, and emerged as one of the most important national leaders of the time, prominently leading the causes of Hindu-Muslim unity as well as espousing [[secularism]] and socialism. He served as Congress president from 1940 to 1945, during which the ''[[Quit India]]'' rebellion was launched. Azad was imprisoned, together with the entire Congress leadership, for three years.\u000a\u000aAmidst communal turmoil following the partition of India, he worked for religious harmony. As India's Education Minister, Azad oversaw the establishment of a national education system with free primary education and modern institutions of higher education.

He also criticised Muslim politicians for focusing on communal issues before the national interest and rejected the [[All India Muslim League]]'s communal separatism. Azad developed curiosity and interest in the [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic doctrines]] of [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] and visited [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]. But his views changed considerably when he met revolutionary activists in Iraq and was influenced by their fervent [[anti-imperialism]] and nationalism.<ref name="BPDIA"/> Against common Muslim opinion of the time, Azad opposed the [[1905 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] in 1905 and became increasingly active in [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary activities]], to which he was introduced by the prominent Hindu revolutionaries [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo Ghosh]] and [[Shyam Sundar Chakravarty]]. Azad initially evoked surprise from other revolutionaries, but Azad won their praise and confidence by working secretly to organise revolutionaries activities and meetings in [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Bombay]] (now called Mumbai).<ref name="BPDIA"/>\u000a\u000aAzad's education had been shaped for him to become a cleric, but his rebellious nature and affinity for politics turned him towards journalism. He established an Urdu weekly newspaper in 1912 called [[Al-Hilal (newspaper)|Al-Hilal]],<ref name=":0" /> and openly attacked British policies while exploring the challenges facing common people, but it was banned in 1914.<ref name=":0" /> Espousing the ideals of Indian nationalism, Azad's publications were aimed at encouraging young Muslims into fighting for independence and Hindu-Muslim unity.<ref name="BPDIA"/> His work helped improve the relationship between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal, which had been soured by the controversy surrounding the partition of Bengal and the issue of separate [[Communalism|communal]] [[electoral district|electorates]].\u000a\u000aWith the onset of [[World War I]], the British stiffened censorship and restrictions on political activity. Azad's ''Al-Hilal'' was consequently banned in 1914 under the ''[[Press Act]]''. Azad started a new journal, the '''''Al-Balagh''''', which increased its active support for nationalist causes and communal unity. In this period Azad also became active in his support for the [[Khilafat]] agitation to protect the position of the [[Sultan]] of [[Ottoman Turkey]], who was considered the [[caliph|Caliph or Khalifa]] for Muslims worldwide. The Sultan had sided against the British in the war and the continuity of his rule came under serious threat, causing distress amongst Muslim conservatives. Azad saw an opportunity to energise [[Indian Muslims]] and achieve major political and social reform through the struggle. With his popularity increasing across India, the government outlawed Azad's second publication under the ''[[Defence of India Regulations Act]]'' and arrested him. The governments of the [[Bombay Presidency]], [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Delhi]] prohibited his entry into the provinces and Azad was moved to a jail in [[Ranchi]], where he was incarcerated until 1 January 1920.<ref name="INC">{{cite web|last=Huq|first=Mushirul|date=23 July 2006|url=http://www.aicc.org.in/new/past-president-detail.php?id=35|title=President Azad|format=PHP|accessdate=23 July 2006}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Literary Works==\u000aMaulana Azad is considered one of the greatest Urdu writers of the 20th century.

He was born in Mekkah, given formal education in Persian and Arabic languages but he was never taught Urdu.\u000a\u000aIt is often said that his book '''India wins Freedom''' is about his political life and '''Ghubar-e-Khatir''' deals with his social and spiritual life.\u000a\u000a== Non-co-operation ==\u000a{{Main article|Non-Cooperation Movement}}\u000aUpon his release, Azad returned to a political atmosphere charged with sentiments of outrage and rebellion against British rule. The Indian public had been angered by the passage of the [[Rowlatt Acts]] in 1919, which severely restricted civil liberties and individual rights. Consequently, thousands of political activists had been arrested and many publications banned. The [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|killing of unarmed civilians at Jallianwala Bagh]] in [[Amritsar]] on 13 April 1919 had provoked intense outrage all over India, alienating most Indians, including long-time British supporters, from the authorities. The Khilafat struggle had also peaked with the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[World War I]] and the raging [[Turkish War of Independence]], which had made the caliphate's position precarious. India's main political party, the Indian National Congress came under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who had aroused excitement all over India when he led the farmers of [[Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha|Champaran and Kheda]] in a successful revolt against British authorities in 1918. Gandhi organised the people of the region and pioneered the art of ''[[Satyagraha]]''\u2014 combining mass civil disobedience with complete non-violence and self-reliance.\u000a\u000aTaking charge of the Congress, Gandhi also reached out to support the Khilafat struggle, helping to bridge Hindu-Muslim political divides. Azad and the Ali brothers - Maulana [[Mohammad Ali]] and [[Shaukat Ali]] - warmly welcomed Congress support and began working together on a programme of ''[[Non-Cooperation Movement|non-co-operation]]'' by asking all Indians to boycott British-run schools, colleges, courts, public services, the civil service, police and military. Non-violence and Hindu-Muslim unity were universally emphasised, while the boycott of foreign goods, especially clothes were organised. Azad joined the Congress and was also elected president of the [[All India Khilafat Committee]]. Although Azad and other leaders were soon arrested, the movement drew out millions of people in peaceful processions, strikes and protests.\u000a\u000aThis period marked a transformation in Azad's own life. Along with fellow Khilafat leaders Dr. [[Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari]], [[Hakim Ajmal Khan]] and others, Azad grew personally close to Gandhi and his philosophy. The three men founded the [[Jamia Millia Islamia]] in Delhi as an institution of higher education managed entirely by Indians without any British support or control. Both Azad and Gandhi shared a deep passion for religion and Azad developed a close friendship with him. He adopted the Prophet Muhammad's ideas by living simply, rejecting material possessions and pleasures. He began to spin his own clothes using ''[[khadi]]'' on the ''[[charkha]]'', and began frequently living and participating in the [[ashram]]s organised by Gandhi.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} Becoming deeply committed to ''[[ahinsa]]'' (''non-violence'') himself, Azad grew close to fellow nationalists like [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Chittaranjan Das]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].<ref name="INC"/> He strongly criticised the continuing suspicion of the Congress amongst the Muslim intellectuals from the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] and the Muslim League.\u000a\u000aThe movement had a sudden decline with rising incidences of violence; a [[Chauri Chaura incident|nationalist mob killed]] 22 policemen in [[Chauri Chaura]] in 1922. Fearing degeneration into violence, Gandhi asked Indians to suspend the revolt and undertook a five-day fast to repent and encourage others to stop the rebellion. Although the movement stopped all over India, several Congress leaders and activists were disillusioned with Gandhi. The following year, the caliphate was overthrown by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and the Ali brothers grew distant and critical of Gandhi and the Congress. Azad's close friend [[Chittaranjan Das]] co-founded the [[Swaraj Party]], breaking from Gandhi's leadership. Despite the circumstances, Azad remained firmly committed to Gandhi's ideals and leadership. In 1923, he became the youngest man to be elected [[Congress president]]. Azad led efforts to organise the [[Flag Satyagraha]] in [[Nagpur]]. Azad served as president of the 1924 Unity Conference in Delhi, using his position to work to re-unite the Swarajists and the Khilafat leaders under the common banner of the Congress. In the years following the movement, Azad travelled across India, working extensively to promote Gandhi's vision, education and social reform.\u000a\u000a==Congress leader==\u000a[[File:Simla conference.JPG|thumb|left|200px|At [[Simla Conference]] (1946) with [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[Jinnah]] and [[C. Rajagopalachari]]]]\u000a\u000aAzad became an inspiring personality in the field of politics. Azad became an important national leader, and served on the [[Congress Working Committee]] and in the offices of general secretary and president many times. The political environment in India re-energised in 1928 with nationalist outrage against the [[Simon Commission]] appointed to propose constitutional reforms. The commission included no Indian members and did not even consult Indian leaders and experts. In response, the Congress and other political parties appointed a commission under [[Motilal Nehru]] to propose constitutional reforms from Indian opinions. In 1928, Azad endorsed the [[Nehru Report]], which was criticised by the Ali brothers and Muslim League politician [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. Azad endorsed the ending of separate [[electoral district|electorates]] based on religion, and called for an independent India to be committed to [[secularism]]. At the 1928 Congress session in [[Guwahati]], Azad endorsed Gandhi's call for [[dominion]] status for India within a year. If not granted, the Congress would adopt the goal of complete political independence for India. Despite his affinity for Gandhi, Azad also drew close to the young radical leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Bose, who had criticised the delay in demanding full independence. Azad developed a close friendship with Nehru and began espousing socialism as the means to fight inequality, poverty and other national challenges. Azad decided the name of Muslim political party [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]]. He was also a friend of [[Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari]], founder of All India Majlis-e-Ahrar. When Gandhi embarked on the [[Dandi Salt March]] that inaugurated the [[Salt Satyagraha]] in 1930, Azad organised and led the nationalist raid, albeit non-violent on the [[Dharasana Satyagraha|Dharasana salt works]] to protest the salt tax and restriction of its production and sale. The biggest nationalist upheaval in a decade, Azad was imprisoned along with millions of people, and would frequently be jailed from 1930 to 1934 for long periods of time. Following the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]] in 1931, Azad was amongst millions of political prisoners released. When elections were called under the [[Government of India Act 1935]], Azad was appointed to organise the Congress election campaign, raising funds, selecting candidates and organising volunteers and rallies across India.<ref name="INC"/> Azad had criticised the Act for including a high proportion of un-elected members in the central legislature, and did not himself contest a seat. He again declined to contest elections in 1937, and helped head the party's efforts to organise elections and preserve co-ordination and unity amongst the Congress governments elected in different provinces.<ref name="INC"/>\u000a\u000aAt the 1936 Congress session in [[Lucknow]], Azad was drawn into a dispute with [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]] and [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]] regarding the espousal of socialism as the Congress goal. Azad had backed the election of Nehru as Congress president, and supported the resolution endorsing socialism. In doing so, he aligned with Congress socialists like Nehru, Subhash Bose and [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]. Azad also supported Nehru's re-election in 1937, at the consternation of many conservative Congressmen. Azad supported dialogue with Jinnah and the Muslim League between 1935 and 1937 over a Congress-League coalition and broader political co-operation. Less inclined to brand the League as obstructive, Azad nevertheless joined the Congress's vehement rejection of Jinnah's demand that the League be seen exclusively as the representative of Indian Muslims.\u000a\u000a==Quit India==\u000a{{Main article|Quit India Movement}}\u000a\u000aIn 1938, Azad served as an intermediary between the supporters of and the Congress faction led by Congress president Subhash Bose, who criticised Gandhi for not launching another rebellion against the British and sought to move the Congress away from Gandhi's leadership. Azad stood by Gandhi with most other Congress leaders, but reluctantly endorsed the Congress's exit from the assemblies in 1939 following the inclusion of India in [[World War II]]. Nationalists were infuriated that Viceroy Lord Linlithgow had entered India into the war without consulting national leaders. Although willing to support the British effort in return for independence, Azad sided with Gandhi when the British ignored the Congress overtures. Azad's criticism of Jinnah and the League intensified as Jinnah called Congress rule in the provinces as "Hindu Raj", calling the resignation of the Congress ministries as a "[[Day of Deliverance (India)|Day of Deliverance]]" for Muslims. Jinnah and the League's separatist agenda was gaining popular support amongst Muslims. Muslim religious and political leaders criticised Azad as being too close to the Congress and placing politics before Muslim welfare.<ref name="INC"/> As the Muslim League adopted a resolution calling for a separate Muslim state ([[Pakistan]]) in its session in [[Lahore]] in 1940, Azad was elected Congress president in its session in [[Ramgarh Cantonment|Ramgarh]]. Speaking vehemently against Jinnah's ''[[Two-Nation Theory]]''\u2014the notion that Hindus and Muslims were distinct nations\u2014Azad lambasted religious separatism and exhorted all Muslims to preserve a united India, as all Hindus and Muslims were Indians who shared deep bonds of brotherhood and nationhood. In his presidential address, Azad said:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>"... Full eleven centuries have passed by since then. [[Islam]] has now as great a claim on the soil of India as [[Hinduism]]. If Hinduism has been the religion of the people here for several thousands of years Islam also has been their religion for a thousand years. Just as a Hindu can say with pride that he is an Indian and follows Hinduism, so also we can say with equal pride that we are Indians and follow Islam. I shall enlarge this orbit still further. The Indian [[Christian]] is equally entitled to say with pride that he is an Indian and is following a religion of India, namely [[Christianity]]."<ref name="INC"/></blockquote>\u000a[[File:Gandhi, Patel and Maulana Azad Sept 1940.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Azad, Patel and Gandhi at an AICC meeting in Bombay, 1940.]]\u000a\u000aIn face of increasing popular disenchantment with the British across India, Gandhi and Patel advocated an all-out rebellion demanding immediate independence. The situation had grown precarious as the Japanese conquered Burma and approached India's borders, which left Indians insecure but resentful of the British inability to protect India. Azad was wary and sceptical of the idea, aware that India's Muslims were increasingly looking to Jinnah and had supported the war. Feeling that a struggle would not force a British exit, Azad and Nehru warned that such a campaign would divide India and make the war situation even more precarious. Intensive and emotional debates took place between Azad, Nehru, Gandhi and Patel in the Congress Working Committee's meetings in May and June 1942. In the end, Azad became convinced that decisive action in one form or another had to be taken, as the Congress had to provide leadership to India's people and would lose its standing if it did not.\u000a\u000aSupporting the call for the British to "[[Quit India]]", Azad began exhorting thousands of people in rallies across the nation to prepare for a definitive, all-out struggle. As Congress president, Azad travelled across India and met with local and provincial Congress leaders and grass-roots activists, delivering speeches and planning the rebellion. Despite their previous differences, Azad worked closely with Patel and Dr. Rajendra Prasad to make the rebellion as effective as possible. On 7 August 1942 at the [[Gowalia Tank]] in Mumbai, Congress president Azad inaugurated the struggle with a vociferous speech exhorting Indians into action. Just two days later, the British arrested Azad and the entire Congress leadership. While Gandhi was incarcerated at the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in [[Pune]], Azad and the Congress Working Committee were imprisoned at a fort in [[Ahmednagar]], where they would remain under isolation and intense security for nearly four years. Outside news and communication had been largely prohibited and completely censored. Although frustrated at their incarceration and isolation, Azad and his companions attested to feeling a deep satisfaction at having done their duty to their country and people.<ref name="NDR">{{cite book|last=Nandurkar|title=Sardarshri Ke Patra (2)|pages=390}}</ref>\u000a\u000aAzad occupied the time playing [[contract bridge|bridge]] and acting as the referee in [[tennis]] matches played by his colleagues. In the early mornings, Azad began working on his classic Urdu work, the '''''Ghubhar-i-Khatir'''''. Sharing daily chores, Azad also taught the Persian and Urdu languages, as well as Indian and world history to several of his companions. The leaders would generally avoid talking of politics, unwilling to cause any arguments that could exacerbate the pain of their imprisonment. However, each year on [[Republic Day (India)|26 January]], which was then considered ''Poorna Swaraj'' (Complete Independence) Day, the leaders would gather to remember their cause and pray together. '''Azad, Nehru and Patel''' would briefly speak about the nation and the future. Azad and Nehru proposed an initiative to forge an agreement with the British in 1943. Arguing that the rebellion had been mistimed, Azad attempted to convince his colleagues that the Congress should agree to negotiate with the British and call for the suspension of disobedience if the British agreed to transfer power. Although his proposal was overwhelmingly rejected, Azad and a few others agreed that Gandhi and the Congress had not done enough. When they learnt of [[Gandhi]] holding talks with [[Jinnah]] in [[Mumbai]] in 1944, Azad criticised Gandhi's move as counter-productive and ill-advised.<ref name="R2G">{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|title=Patel: A Life|pages=330\u201332}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Partition of India==\u000a[[File:Congressmen.png|thumb|right|250px|At Wardha Railway Station:Maulana Azad, Acharya Kripalani, Sardar Patel, Subhash Bose.]]\u000aWith the end of the war, the British agreed to transfer power to Indian hands. All political prisoners were released in 1946 and Azad led the Congress in the elections for the new [[Constituent Assembly of India]], which would draft India's constitution. He headed the delegation to negotiate with the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India|British Cabinet Mission]], in his sixth year as Congress president. While attacking Jinnah's demand for [[Pakistan]] and the mission's proposal of 16 June 1946 that envisaged the partition of India, Azad became a strong proponent of the mission's earlier proposal of 16 May. The proposal advocated a federal system with a limited central government and autonomy for the provinces. The central government would have Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communication while the provinces would won all other subjects unless they voluntarily relinquished selected subjects to the Central Government. Additionally, the proposal called for the "grouping" of provinces on religious lines, which would informally band together the Muslim-majority province in the West as Group B, Muslim-majority provinces of Bengal and Assam as Group C and the rest of India as Group A. While Gandhi and others expressed scepticism of this clause, Azad argued that Jinnah's demand for Pakistan would be buried and the concerns of the Muslim community would be assuaged.<ref name="MEN">{{cite book|last=Menon|first=V.

He nominated Nehru, who replaced him as Congress president and led the Congress into the interim government. Azad was appointed to head the Department of Education. However, Jinnah's ''[[Direct Action Day]]'' agitation for Pakistan, launched on 16 August sparked communal violence across India. Thousands of people were killed as Azad travelled across Bengal and Bihar to calm the tensions and heal relations between Muslims and Hindus. Despite Azad's call for Hindu-Muslim unity, Jinnah's popularity amongst Muslims soared and the League entered a coalition with the Congress in December, but continued to boycott the constituent assembly. Later in his autobiography, Azad indicated Patel having become more pro-partition than the Muslim League, largely due to the League's not co-operating with the Congress in the provisional government on any issue.<ref name="Azad 2003"/>\u000a\u000aAzad had grown increasingly hostile to Jinnah, who had described him as the "Muslim [[Lord Haw-Haw]]" and a "Congress Showboy."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Elephant, the Tiger and the Cellphone: Reflections on India in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=PENGUIN INDIA|year=2007|isbn=9780670081455|last=Azad}}</ref><ref name="The man who stayed behind">{{cite news|title=The man who stayed behind|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-man-who-stayed-behind/article2275717.ece|work=The Hindu|date=11 November 2007|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref> Muslim League politicians accused Azad of allowing Muslims to be culturally and politically dominated by the Hindu community.

I am part of the indivisible unity that is Indian nationality. I am indispensable to this noble edifice and without me this splendid structure is incomplete. I am an essential element, which has gone to build India. I can never surrender this claim."</blockquote>\u000a\u000aAmidst more incidences of violence in early 1947, the Congress-League coalition struggled to function. The provinces of Bengal and [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] were to be partitioned on religious lines, and on 3 June 1947 the British announced a proposal to partition India on religious lines, with the [[List of Indian Princely States|princely states]] free to choose between either dominion. The proposal was hotly debated in the [[All India Congress Committee]], with Muslim leaders [[Saifuddin Kitchlew]] and [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] expressing fierce opposition. Azad privately discussed the proposal with Gandhi, Patel and Nehru, but despite his opposition was unable to deny the popularity of the League and the unworkability of any coalition with the League. Faced with the serious possibility of a civil war, Azad abstained from voting on the resolution, remaining silent and not speaking throughout the AICC session, which ultimately approved the plan.<ref name="PAR">{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|title=Patel: A Life|pages=402}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Post-Independence==\u000aIndia's partition and independence on 15 August 1947 brought with it a scourge of violence that swept the Punjab, Bengal, Bihar, Delhi and many other parts of India. Millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled the newly created Pakistan for India, and millions of Muslims fled for [[West Pakistan]] and [[East Pakistan]], created out of [[East Bengal]]. Violence claimed the lives of an estimated one million people. Azad took up responsibility for the safety of Muslims in India, touring affected areas in Bengal, Bihar, Assam and the Punjab, guiding the organisation of refugee camps, supplies and security. Azad gave speeches to large crowds encouraging peace and calm in the border areas and encouraging Muslims across the country to remain in India and not fear for their safety and security. Focusing on bringing the capital of Delhi back to peace, Azad organised security and relief efforts, but was drawn into a dispute with the [[Deputy prime minister]] and [[Home Minister]] Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel when he demanded the dismissal of Delhi's police commissioner, who was a [[Sikh]] accused by Muslims of overlooking attacks and neglecting their safety.<ref name="RS98">{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|title=Patel: A Life|pages=432\u201333}}</ref> Patel argued that the commissioner was not biased, and if his dismissal was forced it would provoke anger amongst Hindus and Sikhs and divide the city police. In Cabinet meetings and discussions with Gandhi, Patel and Azad clashed over security issues in Delhi and Punjab, as well as the allocation of resources for relief and rehabilitation. Patel opposed Azad and Nehru's proposal to reserve the houses vacated by Muslims who had departed for Pakistan for Muslims in India displaced by the violence.<ref name="RS98"/> Patel argued that a secular government could not offer preferential treatment for any religious community, while Azad remained anxious to assure the rehabilitation of Muslims in India, [[secularism]], religious freedom and equality for all Indians. He supported provisions for Muslim citizens to make avail of Muslim personal law in courts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|title=Patel: A Life|pages=502\u201305}}</ref>\u000a\u000aAzad remained a close confidante, supporter and advisor to prime minister Nehru, and played an important role in framing national policies. Azad masterminded the creation of national programmes of school and college construction and spreading the enrolment of children and young adults into schools, to promote universal primary education. Elected to the lower house of the [[Indian Parliament]], the [[Lok Sabha]] in 1952 and again in 1957, Azad supported Nehru's socialist economic and industrial policies, as well as the advancing social rights and economic opportunities for women and underprivileged Indians. In 1956, he served as president of the [[UNESCO]] General Conference held in Delhi. Azad spent the final years of his life focusing on writing his book ''India Wins Freedom'', an exhaustive account of India's freedom struggle and its leaders, which was published in 1957.\u000a\u000aAs India's first Minister of Education, he emphasised on educating the rural poor and girls. As Chairman of the Central Advisory Board of Education, he gave thrust to adult literacy, universal primary education, free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 14, girl''s education, and diversification of secondary education and vocational training.<ref name="HRD">[http://www.education.nic.in/Speeches/NED09.pdf Speech of Hon\u2019ble Human Resource Minister on National Education Day 2009, Ministry of HRD, Government of India]</ref>\u000aAddressing the conference on All India Education on 16 January 1948, Maulana Azad emphasised,<ref name="HRD"/>\u000a<blockquote>We must not for a moment forget, it is a birthright of every individual to receive at least the basic education without which he cannot fully discharge his duties as a citizen.</blockquote>\u000a\u000aHe oversaw the setting up of the Central Institute of Education, Delhi, which later became the Department of Education of the [[University of Delhi]] as "a research centre for solving new educational problems of the country".<ref>[http://cie.du.ac.in/About_us/about.html About us Central Institute of Education]</ref> Under his leadership, the Ministry of Education established the first [[Indian Institute of Technology]] in 1951 and the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] in 1953.,<ref>[http://www.ugc.ac.in/about/genesis.html UGC Genesis]</ref><ref>[http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/institute/history.php IIT Kharagpur, History]</ref> He also laid emphasis on the development of the [[Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore]] and the Faculty of Technology of the [[Delhi University]].<ref name="CABEAddress">[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/29/12290101.htm Proceedings of the 19th meeting of The Central Advisory Board of Education, New Delhi on 15 and 16 March 1952 ]</ref> He foresaw a great future in the [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]] for India:<ref name="CABEAddress"/><blockquote>I have no doubt that the establishment of this Institute will form a landmark in the progress of higher technological education and research in the country.</blockquote>\u000a\u000a==Criticism==\u000aDuring his life and in contemporary times, Maulana Azad has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent the partition of India although he was committed to united India till his last attempt.
