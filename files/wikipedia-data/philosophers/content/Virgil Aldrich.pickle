Promoted to [[assistant professor]], he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1942 to 1946.

He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness\u2014importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.\u000a\u000a==Honors==\u000a* [[L.H.D.]], [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], 1963\u000a* [[L.H.D.]], [[Kenyon College]], 1972\u000a\u000a==Writings==\u000a'''Books''':\u000a* ''Language and philosophy'' ([Kyoto]: Kyoto American Studies Seminar, 1955)\u000a* ''Philosophy of Art'', (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1963)\u000a* ''The Body of a Person'', (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988)\u000a* ''My Century'', Nantucket, Massachusetts, EditAndPublishYourBook.com/Lulu, November 20, 2010\u000a* ''Philosophical Reflections'', Nantucket, Massachusetts, EditAndPublishYourBook.com/Lulu, \u000aDecember 11, 2010\u000a\u000a'''Contributions''':\u000a* ''Readings in Philosophical Analysis'' (1951)\u000a* ''Reflections on Art'' (1958)\u000a* ''Religious Experience and Truth'' (1961)\u000a* ''Faith and the Philosophers'' (1962)\u000a* ''World Perspectives on Philosophy'' (1967)\u000a* [http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Aldrich%20Design,%20Composition,%20and%20Symbol%20JAAC%201969.htm "Design, Composition, and Symbol"], ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' (Vol. 27, No. 4, Summer, 1969), pp.&nbsp;379\u2013388.\u000a* ''Studies in philosophy: a symposium on Gilbert Ryle'', Edited by Konstantin Kolenda.
