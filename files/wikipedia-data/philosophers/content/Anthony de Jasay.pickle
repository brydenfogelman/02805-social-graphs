(The original Hungarian spelling of his name is Jászay.) He was educated at [[Székesfehérvár]] and [[Budapest]], taking a degree in [[Agriculture]]. In 1947\u201348 he worked as a free-lance journalist, his activity forcing him to flee from the country in 1948. After two years in [[Austria]], he emigrated to [[Australia]] in 1950 and took a part-time course in [[Economics]] at the [[University of Western Australia]]. Winning a Hackett Studentship, he went to [[Oxford]] in 1955 and was elected a research fellow of [[Nuffield College]] where he stayed till 1962, publishing papers in the ''[[Economic Journal]]'', the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' and other scholarly journals.\u000a\u000aIn 1962 he moved to [[Paris]] and worked there as a banker, first in an executive capacity and then on his own account, till 1979, doing investment business in several European countries and the [[United States]]. In 1979, he retired to the [[Normandy]] coast where he still lives. He has a wife, three children, and three grandchildren.\u000a\u000aWhile his initial interest and training were in economics, he has later turned to political philosophy, and his writings draw on both. He has published five books, several of which have been translated into a total of six languages, as well as numerous articles, mainly in English but also in French and German.\u000a\u000ade Jasay writes [http://www.econlib.org/library/Browse/articlearchiveby_rfe.html''Reflections from Europe''], a monthly column for [http://www.econlib.org ''The Library of Economics and Liberty''].\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a*[http://www.econlib.org/library/LFBooks/Jasay/jsyStt.html ''The State''] (1985)\u000a*''Social Contract, Free Ride'' (1989)\u000a*''Choice, Contract, Consent: A Restatement of Liberalism'' (1991)\u000a*''Before Resorting to Politics'' (1996)\u000a*''Against Politics: On Government, Anarchy and Order'' (1997)\u000a*''Justice and its Surroundings'' (2002)\u000a*''Political Philosophy, Clearly'' (2010)\u000a*''Political Economy, Concisely'' (2010)\u000a*''Liberal Reason, Social Confusion'' (2010)\u000a*''Economic Sense and Nonsense: Reflections from Europe, 2007-2012'' (forthcoming)\u000a*''Social Justice and the Indian Rope Trick'' (forthcoming)\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a*[http://www.dejasay.org/default.asp Official]\u000a*[http://www.econlib.org/library/LFBooks/Jasay/jsyStt.html Full text of de Jasay's ''The State'']\u000a*[http://www.againstpolitics.com/2008/12/09/the-presumption-of-liberty/ de Jasay, and The Presumption of Liberty]\u000a*[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=216 Anthony de Jasay: A Life in the Service of Liberty]\u000a*[http://www.mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae1_3_11.pdf Review of Against Politics: On Government, Anarchy, and Order]\u000a* {{Goodreads author}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Jasay, Anthony de}}\u000a[[Category:1925 births]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a[[Category:Anarcho-capitalists]]\u000a[[Category:Hungarian libertarians]]\u000a[[Category:Hungarian economists]]\u000a[[Category:Hungarian philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Austrian School economists]]\u000a[[Category:Cato Institute people]]
