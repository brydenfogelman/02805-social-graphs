Her paper \u201cDated Rightness and Moral Imperfection\u201d<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/218427 "Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection"], ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. LXXXV (October, 1976), 449-487 (as Holly S. Goldman).</ref> helped launch a debate now known as the debate between [[Actualism]] and [[Possibilism (philosophy)|Possibilism]] by arguing for the first time in favor of Actualism.<ref>Holly S. Goldman, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/218427 "Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection"], ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. LXXXV (October 1976), n. 16, p. 246.</ref> Possibilists believe that whether or not the agent ought to perform an immediate action depends on whether performing it would enable the ideal course of action in the future. Actualists believe that whether or not an agent ought to perform the action depends on what performing that action would actually lead her to do in the future.\u000a\u000aThe issue is illustrated by an example from Smith/Goldman\u2019s later paper \u201cDoing the Best One Can\u201d.<ref>"Doing the Best One Can," in ''Values and Morals'', eds Alvin Goldman and Jaegwon Kim (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978), 186-214. Published under the name Holly S. Goldman.</ref> A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a job interview. If S agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year job. If S accepts the task but fails to comment on the paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no job offer. If S declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year job offer. Clearly S\u2019s accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student\u2019s receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. Actualism takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash.\u000a\u000a=== Information ===\u000aSmith also considered the question of how to use moral theories in actual decision-making, especially given agent's lack of enough information about the world to ascertain accurately which action their favored moral theory implies. Thus the intent to avoid [[adultery]] may be thwarted by not knowing that a partner is actually married. And someone trying to follow [[W. D. Ross]]\u2019s [[prima facie]] duty to keep promises may fail should she forget the promise. Smith repeatedly explored these \u201cepistemic\u201d problems<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2215557 "Making Moral Decisions"], ''Nous'', Vol. XXII, No.1 (March 1988), 89-108; [http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0265052500001047 "Two-Tier Moral Codes"], ''Social Philosophy & Policy'', Vol. 7 (Autumn 1989), 112-132; "Deciding How To Decide: Is There a Regress Problem?" in Michael Bacharach and Susan Hurley (eds), ''Essays in the Foundations of Decision Theory'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991, 194-219; [http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0265052509990161 \u201cSubjective Rightness\u201d], in ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' 27 (Summer 2010), 64-110; [http://www.jesp.org/ \u201cThe Prospective View of Obligation\u201d], ''Journal of Ethics and Social Philosophy'', February 2011; [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11572-011-9113-1 \u201cNon-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance\u201d], ''Criminal Law and Philosophy'', Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-6077.2012.00235.x/abstract \u201cUsing Moral Principles to Guide Decisions\u201d], ''Philosophical Issues'', Vol. 22, ''Action Theory'' (2012), 369-86; \u201cThe Moral Clout of Reasonable Beliefs,\u201d in Mark Timmons (ed.), ''Oxford Studies in Normative Ethics'', Vol. I (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1\u201325; [http://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=ethics \u201cThe Subjective Moral Duty to Inform Oneself before Acting\u201d], forthcoming in ''Ethics''.</ref> and argued that the solution depends on recognizing that moral theories must be supplemented by a hierarchy of decision rules that prescribe acts as \u201csubjectively right\u201d to agents who are uncertain what the moral theory itself recommends.
