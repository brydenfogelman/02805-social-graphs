He founded the empirical brand of philosophy known as [[Australian realism]] (see [[Scottish realism]]).\u000a\u000aAnderson's promotion of '[[Freethought|free thought]]' in all subjects, including politics and morality, was controversial and brought him into constant conflict with the august senate of the university. However, he is credited with educating a generation of influential 'Andersonian' thinkers and activists\u2014some of whom helped to place Sydney in the forefront of the [[Sexual revolution|'sexual revolution']] of the 1950s and 1960s.\u000a\u000aTo Anderson, an acceptable philosophy must have significant 'sweep' and be capable of challenging and moulding ideas in every aspect of intellect and society.\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aAnderson was born in [[Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire|Stonehouse]], Lanarkshire, Scotland and educated at the former [[Hamilton Academy]] from which school he won a bursary to attend the [[University of Glasgow]] in the university's Bursary Competition of 1911.<ref name="ADB">[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070060b.htm Online Dictionary of Australian Biography]</ref><ref>[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/anderson/album.html University of Sydney \u2013 John Anderson Archive \u2013 photograph \u2013 winners of the University of Glasgow Bursary competition, Hamilton Academy 1911] Retrieved 20 October 2010</ref> Anderson was listed among notable former pupils of Hamilton Academy in a 1950 magazine article on the school.<ref>Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association Magazine, February 1950, feature on Hamilton Academy in the article series 'Famous Scottish Schools'</ref> His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]], 1921 to his death in 1955, and described as "the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy."<ref>Weblin, Mark "[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/anderson/contributors/weblin/tnl/tnl03.pdf Idealism in Australia and New Zealand]" ''The Northern Line'' No. 3 May 2007, p 6.

After graduation, he was awarded the Ferguson Scholarship in Philosophy and the Shaw Philosophical Fellowship, the examinations for which were open to graduates of any of the four Scottish universities.<ref name=smhdec1926>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16338321?searchTerm=%22Professor%20John%20Anderson%22%20&searchLimits= The Challis Chair: Prof John Anderson's Appointment] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 7 December 1926, p 12</ref>\u000a\u000aHe served as Assistant in Philosophy at the [[University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire|University College, Cardiff]] (Cardiff) (1917\u201319), in Moral Philosophy and Logic in the University of Glasgow (1919\u201320) and lectured in Logic and Metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1920\u201326).<ref name=smhdec1926/>\u000a\u000a==Social theory==\u000aAfter arriving in Sydney in 1927 he associated with the [[Communist Party of Australia]] and contributed to their journals, sometimes under a nom de plume<ref name="ADB"/> but, by about 1932 he began to believe that communism under [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]] was a dictatorship with no room for workers' control or participation. He then became aligned with the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] movement for a period of time. But "[h]e could not put up any longer with dialectical materialism or with the servile state which he saw was being imposed by the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat".<ref name="ADB"/><ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/49425870 Russia: Is She Approaching a Crisis?] ''[[The Northern Standard]]'', 2 August 1935, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref>\u000a\u000aAnderson later abandoned authoritarian forms of socialism and became what would today be called a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]]\u2014an opponent of all forms of [[authoritarianism]]. Sometimes he described himself as an [[anarchism|anarchist]] but, after the 1930s, he gave up his earlier political [[Utopian socialism|utopianism]].\u000a\u000a==Advocacy of academic freedom==\u000aAs Sydney University's Challis Professor of Philosophy, Anderson was a formidable champion of the principle of academic freedom from authoritarian intervention. For example, he fought a successful battle to end the role of the [[British Medical Association]] in setting course standards and student quotas in the medical school. He also railed against the presence on campus of a military unit\u2014the [[Sydney University Regiment]]\u2014and lived to see the day in 1960 when the regiment's campus HQ was destroyed by fire. (The regiment was subsequently rehoused at a new facility on university-owned land at [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]].)<ref>[http://regimental-books.com.au/sydney-university-regiment-presentation-of-the-queens-and-regimental-colours-p-2700.html Sydney University Regiment Presentation of the Queen's and Regimental Colours] Historical exposition at Regimental Books website</ref>\u000a\u000aAnderson was censured by the [[Sydney University]] Senate in 1931 after criticising the role of war memorials in sanctifying war.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/21703627 University professor censured] ''The Brisbane Courier'' 22 July 1931, p.19, at Trove, National Library of Australia</ref><ref>Anderson's [http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/28040568 reply to the Senate] was published the same week.

He was president of the society throughout that period.\u000a\u000aIt is legendary that the university's Senate, accepting that it could not realise its desire to sack the controversial Challis Professor, sought to reduce Anderson's stature and influence by creating a new chair of "Moral and Political Philosophy" to which [[Alan Stout (philosopher)|Alan Stout]] was appointed.<ref name=Stoutobit>Armstrong D. M. [http://www.humanities.org.au/Resources/Downloads/Fellows/Obituaries/AlanKerStout.pdf Obituary: Alan Ker Stout (1900\u20131983)] in Australian Academy of the Humanities [http://www.humanities.org.au/Portals/0/documents/Fellows/Obituaries/AlanKerStout.pdf Obituary: Alan Ker Stout, 1900\u20131983] at Australian Academy of the Humanities, [http://www.humanities.org.au/Portals/0/documents/Publications/Proceedings/Proc1983.pdf Proceedings 1982-3] pp.106\u2013109</ref> This purpose was not achieved, as Anderson continued to lecture on ethics and politics. Stout (who had been urged by Anderson to apply for the position) was a steady admirer and supporter of the Challis Professor and declined to undercut his prestige in any way. The result was that Sydney gained a second prestigious and personable philosopher who "brought a quick intelligence, intellectual grasp, a flair for putting things simply and clearly, together with a genuine respect for the views of others and readiness to appreciate their point of view". On Anderson's retirement, the two departments were merged under Stout as 'the Professor of Philosophy'.<ref name=Stoutobit/>\u000a\u000a==Thought and influence==\u000a\u000aAs a committed empiricist, Anderson argued that there is only one realm of "being" and it can be best understood through science and naturalistic philosophy. He asserted that there is no supernatural god and that there are no non-natural realms along the lines of Platonic ideals. He rejected all notions that knowledge could be obtained by means other than descriptions of facts and any belief that revelation or mysticism could be sources for obtaining truth. He was arguing that traditional Christian concepts of good and evil were only meant for slaves and that, in actuality, the idea of morality was empty. For Anderson, the term "good" was valid when applied objectively to human activities which were free, critical and creative but the more common subjective applications were to be avoided or exposed as deceptive. Not surprisingly, Anderson's influence was both extensive and controversial as he constantly examined and fearlessly criticised hallowed beliefs and institutions.\u000a<blockquote>He is, arguably, the most important philosopher who has worked in Australia. Certainly he was the most important in both the breadth and depth of influence. Among the philosophers who got their original intellectual formation from Anderson are [[John Passmore]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[A. J. Baker|A.J. ('Jim') Baker]], [[David Stove]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|myself]]. There are lots more. But for every student who became a philosopher there were far, far, more in the law, in medicine, in journalism, in other academic disciplines, that were profoundly influenced by him. I am inclined to think that, especially in the thirties and forties of the last century, Anderson was the person who set the agenda, and set the tone, for intellectual discussion in Sydney.<ref>Armstrong D M Address on 9 July 2005 [http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=597 ''John Anderson Remembered'']</ref> \u2013 David Armstrong (2005)</blockquote>\u000a\u000aAnderson's influence has spread through his personal impact on several generations of students, the "Andersonians", who include the philosophers named above, together with [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Eugene Kamenka]]; the [[World War II]] organiser [[Alfred Conlon|Alf Conlon]], many members of the [[Sydney Push]], Tonga's 'I. [[Futa Helu]], and jurist [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]], later to be Australia's best-remembered governor-general.\u000a\u000a==Free Thought Society and the Sydney Libertarians==\u000aAnderson's insistence on unceasing inquiry and criticism became central to the intellectual principles of the university's Libertarian Society which supplanted the Free Thought Society in the early 1950s and provided a philosophic platform for the much broader subculture known as "[[Sydney Push|the Push]]" throughout the 1960s. He was a defender of free speech and was critical of the Australian government's bans on certain political publications (1928). He advocated religious and sexual freedoms and free discussion of issues in an era when mention of [[taboo]] subjects commonly resulted in angry public condemnation by prominent moralists.\u000a\u000aAfter the Second World War, however, Anderson began exhibiting more conservative views. Jim Baker interprets this latter stage not so much as "a definite change in his overall thinking than ... an alteration of emphasis and interest".<ref name=bakerasp>{{cite book|title=Anderson's Social Philosophy: The Social Thought and Political Life of Professor John Anderson|last=Baker|first=A J|publisher=Angus & Robertson 1979|location=Sydney}}</ref>{{rp|p130}} In other words, according to Baker, while Anderson's political positions changed over time his philosophy remained constant. To many, however, it seemed that Anderson was departing from his pluralism. During the 1949 coal miners' strike, for instance, he supported the government's action in using troops as strikebreakers.<ref name=bakerasp/> At a Free Thought Society meeting in August 1950 he refused to oppose conscription for the war in Korea.<ref name=Coombs>{{cite book|title=Sex and Anarchy: The Life and Death of the Sydney Push|last=Coombs|first=Anne|publisher=Viking 1996|location=Ringwood, Victoria}}</ref>{{rp|p12}} In 1951 he refused to allow students to use the Free Thought Society to canvass the 'No' case for [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]]' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the [[referendum]] of that year.<ref name=Coombs/>{{rp|p130}} This was the last straw for many Freethinkers; Anderson's apparent authoritarianism caused most to abandon the Free Thought Society and to establish the Libertarian Society. (It must be pointed out that Anderson did not support the banning of the Communist Party\u2014in fact he attacked the proposal.<ref name=Weblin>Weblin, Mark (ed.), ''A Perilous and Fighting Life: From Communist to Conservative: The Political Writings of Professor John Anderson'' (North Melbourne: Pluto Press, 2003)</ref>{{rp|p18}}) The Free Thought Society held its last meeting in 1951.<ref name=bakerasp/>{{rp|p130}} The Libertarian Society functioned from 1952 to 1969.<ref name=bakerasp/>{{rp|p144}}\u000a\u000aAnderson broke off contact with the former disciples who formed the Libertarian Society and never associated with [[Sydney Push|"Push"]] people who routinely sang his praises along with the bawdy songs he had imported to his new country.<ref>''Ballad of Professor John Glaister'' is one example, some of the words of which have been published in ''Snatches & Lays'' (Sun Books, Melbourne, 1975)</ref> However, even after retirement in 1958 and to the brink of his death in 1962, he was seen daily in his study, continuing his work and reviewing earlier work. Among his last publications were ''Classicism'' (1960), ''Empiricism and Logic'' (1962) and ''Relational Arguments'' (1962)<ref>Anderson, J.
