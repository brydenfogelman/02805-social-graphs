He wrote on numerous topics, including [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[historiography]] and [[aesthetics]]. He was a [[Liberalism|liberal]], although he opposed [[laissez-faire]] [[free trade]], and had considerable influence on other Italian intellectuals including both Marxist [[Antonio Gramsci]] and fascist [[Giovanni Gentile]].\u000aHe was President of [[PEN International]], the worldwide writers' association, from 1949 until 1952.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aCroce was born in [[Pescasseroli]] in the [[Abruzzo]] region of Italy. His family was influential and wealthy, and he was raised in a very strict Catholic environment. Around the age of 16, he quit Catholicism and developed a personal [[philosophy of life|philosophy of spiritual life]], in which religion cannot be anything but an historical institution where the creative strength of mankind can be expressed. He kept this philosophy for the rest of his life.\u000a\u000aIn 1883, an earthquake occurred in the village of Casamicciola on the island of [[Ischia]] near [[Naples]], where he was on holiday with his family, destroying the home they lived in. His mother, father, and only sister were all killed, while he was buried for a long time and barely survived. After the earthquake he inherited his family's fortune and\u2014much like [[Schopenhauer]]\u2014was able to live the rest of his life in relative leisure, devoting a great deal of time to philosophy as an independent [[intellectual]] writing from his [[palazzo]] in [[Naples]]. (Ryn, 2000:xi<ref name="lib"/>).\u000a\u000aHe graduated in law at the [[University of Naples]], while reading extensively on [[historical materialism]]. His ideas were publicized at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] towards the ends of the 1890s by Professor [[Antonio Labriola]]. Croce was well acquainted with and sympathetic to the developments in European socialist philosophy exemplified by [[August Bebel]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Paul Lafargue]], [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], and [[Filippo Turati]].\u000a\u000aInfluenced by Neapolitan-born [[Gianbattista Vico]]'s thoughts about art and history,<ref>Croce ,Benedetto 'The Philosophy of [[Giambattista Vico]]' trans R.G.Collingwood London, 1923</ref> he began studying philosophy in 1893. Croce also purchased the house in which Vico had lived. His friend, the philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]], encouraged him to read [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]. Croce's famous commentary on Hegel, ''What is Living and What is Dead in the Philosophy of Hegel'', was published in 1907.\u000a\u000a=== Political involvement ===\u000aAs his fame increased, Croce was persuaded, against his initial wishes,{{Verify source|date=November 2012}} to become involved with politics. He was appointed to the Italian Senate, a lifelong position, in 1910. (Ryn, 2000:xi<ref name="lib"/>). He was an open critic of Italy's participation in [[World War I]], feeling that it was a suicidal trade war. Though this made him initially unpopular, his reputation was restored after the war. He was Minister of Public Education between 1920 and 1921 for the 5th and last government headed by [[Giovanni Giolitti]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] assumed power slightly more than a year after Croce's exit from government; Mussolini's first Minister or Public Education was Giovanni Gentile, an independent who later became a fascist and with whom Croce had earlier cooperated in a philosophical [[polemic]] against [[positivism]]. Gentile remained minister for only a year, but managed to begin a comprehensive reform of Italian education that was based partly on Croce's earlier suggestions. Gentile's reform remained in force well beyond the Fascist regime, and was only abolished in 1962.\u000a\u000aCroce was instrumental in the relocation of the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III]] to Naples' [[Royal Palace of Naples|Palazzo Reale]] in 1923.\u000a\u000a=== Relations with Fascism ===\u000a\u000aCroce initially supported Mussolini's [[Italian Fascism|Fascist government]] that took power in 1922.<ref>Denis Mack Smith, "Benedetto Croce: History and Politics", ''Journal of Contemporary History'' Vol 8(1) Jan 1973 pg 47.</ref> However, the assassination by Fascists of the socialist politician, [[Giacomo Matteotti]], in June 1924 shook Croce's support for Mussolini. In May 1925 Croce was one of the signatories to the [[Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals]] which had been written by Croce himself; however in June of the same year he voted in the Senate in support of the Mussolini government. He later explained that he had hoped that the support for Mussolini in parliament would weaken the more extreme Fascists who, he believed, were responsible for Matteotti's murder.\u000a\u000aCroce was seriously threatened by Mussolini's regime, though the only act of physical violence he suffered at the hands of the fascists was the ransacking of his home and library in Naples in November 1926.<ref>See the detailed description in a letter by Fausto Nicolini to Giovanni Gentile published in {{cite book |title=Per invigilare me stesso |first=Gennaro |last=Sasso |authorlink= |publisher=Il mulino |location=Bologna |year=1989 |isbn= |pages=139\u201340 |page= |accessdate= |url=}}</ref> Although he managed to stay outside prison thanks to his reputation, he remained subject to surveillance, and his academic work was kept in obscurity by the government, to the extent that no mainstream newspaper or academic publication ever referred to him. Croce later coined the term ''onagrocrazia'' (literally "government by asses") to emphasize the anti-intellectual and boorish tendencies of parts of the Fascist regime.<ref>It is a disdainful term for misgovernment, a late and satirical addition to [[Aristotle]]'s famous three: [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]].</ref> However, in describing Fascism as anti-intellectual Croce ignored the many Italian intellectuals who at the time actively supported Mussolini's regime, including Croce's former friend and colleague, Gentile. Croce also described Fascism as ''malattia morale'' (literally "moral illness"). When Mussolini's government adopted [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies in 1938, Croce was the only non-Jewish intellectual who refused to complete a government questionnaire designed to collect information on the so-called "racial background" of Italian intellectuals.\u000a\u000a=== The new Republic ===\u000aIn 1944, when democracy was restored in Southern Italy, Croce, as an "icon of [[liberal anti-fascism]]", became minister without portfolio in governments headed by [[Pietro Badoglio]] and by [[Ivanoe Bonomi]] (Ryn, 2000:xi\u2013xii<ref name="lib"/>).<ref>For about a month in the so-called Second Badoglio government and again for a month in the Second Bonomi government.</ref> He left the government in July 1944 but remained president of the [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] until 1947 (Ryn, 2000:xii<ref name="lib"/>).\u000a\u000aCroce voted for the Monarchy in the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Constitutional referendum]] of June 1946, after having persuaded his Liberal party to adopt a neutral stance. He was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] which existed in Italy between June 1946 and January 1948. He spoke in the Assembly against the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Peace treaty]] (signed in February 1947), which he regarded as humiliating for Italy. He declined to stand as provisional [[President of Italy]].\u000a\u000a=== Philosophical works ===\u000aCroce's most interesting philosophical ideas are expounded in three works: ''Aesthetic'' (1902), ''Logic'' (1908), and ''Philosophy of the Practical'' (1908), but his complete work is spread over 80 books and 40 years worth of publications in his own bimonthly literary magazine, ''[[La Critica]]''. (Ryn, 2000:xi<ref name="lib">History as the story of liberty: English translation of Croce's 1938 collection of essays originally in Italian; translation published by [[Liberty Fund Inc.]] in the USA in 2000 with a [[foreword]] by [[Claes G. Ryn]]. ISBN 0-86597-268-0 (hardback). See {{harvnb|Croce|1938}}.</ref>) Croce was philosophically a pantheist, but, from a religious point of view, an [[agnostic]];<ref>La Critica. Rivista di Letteratura, Storia e Filosofia diretta da B. Croce, 1, 1903 p.372</ref> however, he did publish an essay entitled "Why We Cannot Help Calling Ourselves [[Christians]]". This essay shows the Christian roots of European culture, but religion is considered by Croce a mere propaedeutic study  for philosophy, which is the only true science: philosophy is in fact the science of spirit (the "Philosophy of Spirit").\u000a\u000a==The Philosophy of Spirit==\u000a{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\u000aHeavily influenced by [[Hegel]] and other German Idealists such as [[Schelling]], Croce produced what was called, by him, the Philosophy of Spirit. His preferred designations were "Absolute Idealism" or "Absolute Historicism". Croce's work can be seen as a second attempt (contra [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]) to resolve the problems and conflicts between [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]] (or sensationalism and transcendentalism, respectively). He calls his way ''immanentism'', and concentrates on the lived human experience, as it happens in specific places and times. Since the root of reality is this immanent existence in concrete experience, Croce places [[aesthetics]] at the foundation of his philosophy.\u000a\u000a===The Domains of Mind===\u000aCroce's methodological approach to philosophy is expressed in his divisions of the spirit, or mind. He divides mental activity first into the theoretical, and then the practical. The theoretical division splits between aesthetic and logic. This theoretical aesthetic includes most importantly: intuitions and history. The logical includes concepts and relations. Practical spirit is concerned with economics and ethics. Economics is here to be understood as an exhaustive term for all utilitarian matters.\u000a\u000aEach of these divisions have an underlying structure that colors, or dictates, the sort of thinking that goes on within them. While  Aesthetic is driven by beauty, Logic is subject to truth, Economics is concerned with what is useful, and the moral, or Ethics, is bound to the good. This schema is descriptive in that it attempts to elucidate the logic of human thought; however, it is prescriptive as well, in that these ideas form the basis for epistemological claims and confidence.\u000a\u000a==History==\u000aCroce also had great esteem for [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], and shared his opinion that history should be written by philosophers. Croce's ''On History'' sets forth the view of history as "philosophy in motion", that there is no "cosmic design" or ultimate plan in history, and that the "science of history" was a farce.\u000a\u000a==Beauty==\u000aCroce's work ''Breviario di estetica'' (''The Essence of Aesthetics'') appears in the form of four lessons (''quattro lezioni'') that he was asked to write and deliver at the inauguration of [[Rice University]] in 1912. He declined an invitation to attend the event, but he wrote the lessons and submitted them for translation, so that they could be read in his absence.\u000a\u000aIn this brief, but dense, work, Croce sets forth his theory of [[art]]. He believed that art is more important than science or metaphysics, since only art edifies us. He claimed that all we know can be reduced to logical and imaginative knowledge. Art springs from the latter, making it at its heart, pure imagery. All thought is based in part on this, and it precedes all other thought. The task of an artist is then to invent the perfect image that they can produce for their viewer, since this is what beauty fundamentally is&nbsp;\u2013 the formation of inward, mental images in their ideal state. Our intuition is the basis of forming these concepts within us.\u000a\u000aThis theory was later debated by such contemporary Italian philosophers as [[Umberto Eco]], who locates the aesthetic within a semiotic construction.<ref>Umberto Eco, "A Theory of Semiotics" (Indiana University Press. 1976)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Contributions to liberal political theory==\u000a\u000aCroce's [[liberalism]] differs from the theories advocated by most proponents of liberal political thought, including those in Britain and in the United States of America: while Croce theorises that the individual is the basis of society, he rejects [[Atomism (social)|social atomism]], and while Croce accepts [[limited government]], he refuses that the government should have fixed legitimate powers.\u000a\u000aCroce did not agree with [[John Locke]] about the nature of liberty.  Croce believed that liberty is not a [[natural right]] but an earned right that arises out of continuing historical struggle for its maintenance.\u000a\u000aCroce defined civilization as the "continual vigilance" against barbarism, and liberty conformed to his ideal for civilization as it allows one to experience the full potential of life.\u000a\u000aCroce also rejects [[egalitarianism]] as absurd. In short, his variety of liberalism is [[aristocracy|aristocratic]], as he views society being led by the few who can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty, with the great mass of citizens simply benefiting from them but unable to fully comprehend their creations (Ryn, 2000:xii<ref name="lib"/>).\u000a\u000a==Selected quotations==\u000a* "All history is contemporary history."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Allan |first=George |year=1972 |title=Croce and Whitehead On Concrescence |volume=2 |issue=2 |journal=Process Studies |pages=95\u2013111 |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2328 |postscript=.
