The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].\u000a\u000aJames was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]] (through both his parents), uniquely positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother Mary was compelled to [[Abdication|abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded the last [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarch of England and Ireland, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], who died without issue.{{efn|By the normal rules of succession James had the best claim to the English throne, as the great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].

({{harvnb|Stewart|2003|pp=159\u2013161}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|pp=138\u2013141}}).}} He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the [[Jacobean era]] after him, until his death in 1625 at the age of 58. After the [[Union of the Crowns]], he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, only returning to Scotland once in 1617, and [[style (manner of address)|styled]] himself "[[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]".{{efn|The title was opposed by the [[English Parliament]] and was not used on English statutes.

In his reign, the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and [[British colonisation of the Americas]] began.\u000a\u000aAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]]. Under James, the "Golden Age" of [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] literature and drama continued, with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], [[Ben Jonson]], and Sir [[Francis Bacon]] contributing to a flourishing literary culture.{{sfn|Milling|2004|p=155}} James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597), ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' (1598), and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible that was named after him: the [[Authorised King James Version]].{{efn|"James VI and I was the most writerly of British monarchs. He produced original poetry, as well as translation and a treatise on poetics; works on witchcraft and tobacco; meditations and commentaries on the Scriptures; a manual on kingship; works of political theory; and, of course, speeches to parliament&nbsp;... He was the patron of Shakespeare, Jonson, Donne, and the translators of the "Authorized version" of the Bible, surely the greatest concentration of literary talent ever to enjoy royal sponsorship in England." {{harv|Rhodes|Richards|Marshall|2003|p=1}}.}} Sir [[Anthony Weldon]] claimed that James had been termed "the wisest fool in [[Christianity|Christendom]]", an epithet associated with his character ever since.{{efn|"A very wise man was wont to say that he believed him the wisest fool in Christendom, meaning him wise in small things, but a fool in weighty affairs." Sir Anthony Weldon (1651), ''The Court and Character of King James I'', quoted by {{harvnb|Stroud|1999|p=27}}; "The label 'the wisest fool in Christendom', often attributed to [[Henry IV of France]] but possibly coined by Anthony Weldon, catches James's paradoxical qualities very neatly" {{harv|Smith|2003|p=238}}.}} Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch.{{efn|"Historians have returned to reconsidering James as a serious and intelligent ruler" ({{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|pp=4\u20136}}); "In contrast to earlier historians, recent research on his reign has tended to emphasize the wisdom and downplay the foolishness" {{harv|Smith|2003|p=238}}.}}\u000a\u000a==Childhood==\u000a[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland by Arnold van Brounckhorst.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of James as a boy, after [[Arnold Bronckorst]], 1574]]\u000a\u000a===Birth===\u000aJames was the only son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and her second husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]].

James inherited his father's titles of [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]]. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her.{{efn|Elizabeth I wrote to Mary: "My ears have been so astounded, my mind so disturbed and my heart so appalled at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your late husband and my slaughtered cousin, that I can scarcely as yet summon the spirit to write about it&nbsp;... I will not conceal from you that people for the most part are saying that you will look through your fingers at this deed instead of avenging it and that you don't care to take action against those who have done you this pleasure." Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] nonetheless concludes: "Not a single piece of uncontaminated evidence has ever been found to show that Mary had foreknowledge of Darnley's murder" {{harv|Guy|2004|pp=312\u2013313}}. In historian David Harris Willson's view, however: "That Bothwell was the murderer no one can doubt; and that Mary was his accomplice seems equally certain." {{harv|Willson|1963|p=18}}.}} In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in [[Loch Leven Castle]]; she never saw her son again.
