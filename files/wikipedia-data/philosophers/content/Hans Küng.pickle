Since 1995 he has been President of the [[Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration|Foundation for a Global Ethic]] (''Stiftung Weltethos''). He is notable for his rejection of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]].<ref>[http://www.shc.edu/theolibrary/resources/kung.htm Hans Kung, Daniel T. Spotswood]</ref> Although Küng is not officially allowed to teach Catholic theology,<ref>Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, "Declaration", (15 December 1979) http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19791215_christi-ecclesia_en.html</ref> his priestly faculties have not been revoked.<ref>Küng, ''The Catholic Church: A Short History'' (2002), Introduction, p. ''xviii'': "In 1979 I then had personal experience of the Inquisition under another pope. My permission to teach was withdrawn by the church, but nevertheless I retained my chair and my institute (which was separated from the Catholic faculty). For two further decades I remained unswervingly faithful to my church in critical loyalty, and to the present day I have remained professor of ecumenical theology and a Catholic priest in good standing. I affirm the papacy for the Catholic Church, but at the same time indefatigably call for a radical reform of it in accordance with the criterion of the gospel."</ref> In 1979, he had to leave the Catholic faculty, but remained at the [[University of Tübingen]] as a professor of [[ecumenical]] theology, serving as an [[emeritus professor]] since 1996.\u000a\u000a== Life and work ==\u000aKüng was born in [[Sursee]], [[Canton of Lucerne]]. He studied philosophy and theology at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] in 1954. He continued his education in various European cities, including the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].\u000a\u000aIn 1960, he was appointed professor of theology at [[Eberhard Karls university]], [[Tübingen]], Germany. Like his colleague Joseph Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), in 1962 he was appointed ''[[peritus]]'' by [[Pope John XXIII]], serving as an expert theological advisor to members of the [[Second Vatican Council]] until its conclusion in 1965. At Küng's instigation, the Catholic faculty at Tübingen appointed Ratzinger as professor of dogmatic theology.<ref>George Ratzinger, ''My Brother the Pope'', Ignatius Press (2011), p. 201. "the University of Tubingen offered him (Joseph Ratzinger) in 1966 a newly created chair in dogmatic theology. One theologian in Tubingen who had strongly advocated recruiting Ratzinger was Hans Kung."</ref>\u000a\u000aIn a 1963 tour of the United States, Küng gave the lecture "The Church and Freedom", receiving an [[interdict]] from [[The Catholic University of America]] but an honorary doctorate from [[St. Louis University]]. He accepted an invitation to visit [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]].<ref name=KIW>''Hans Küng'', "Makers of the Modern Theological Mind Series", John J. Kiwiet, 1985.</ref>\u000a\u000aKüng's [[thesis|doctoral thesis]], "''Justification. La doctrine de Karl Barth et une réflexion catholique''", was finally published in English in 1964 as ''Justification: The Doctrine of Karl Barth''. It located a number of areas of agreement between Barthian and Catholic theologies of [[Justification (theology)|justification]], concluding that the differences were not fundamental and did not warrant a division in the Church. (The book included a letter from [[Karl Barth]] attesting that he agreed with Küng's representation of his theology.) In this book Küng argued that Barth, like [[Martin Luther]], overreacted against the Catholic Church which, despite its imperfections, has been and remains the body of Christ.<ref>Hans Küng ''Justification: The Doctrine of Karl Barth'', 1964, p. 200</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the late 1960s, he became the first major Roman Catholic theologian since the late 19th century [[Old Catholic Church]] schism to publicly reject the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], in particular in his book ''Infallible? An Inquiry'' (1971). Consequently, on 18 December 1979, he was stripped of his ''missio canonica'',\u000a<!--The German-language WP has an article entitled ''missio canonica'' which might serve if translated into English.-->\u000ahis licence to teach as a Roman Catholic theologian, but carried on teaching as a [[tenure]]d professor of [[ecumenism|ecumenical theology]] at the [[University of Tübingen]] until his retirement (''Emeritierung'') in 1996.\u000a\u000aFor three months in 1981, he was guest professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. During this visit to America he was invited to only one Catholic institution, the [[University of Notre Dame]]. He appeared on the [[Phil Donahue Show]].<ref>Briggs, Kenneth A., ''[[New York Times]]'', (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: 13 December 1981. p. A.29.</ref> In October 1986, he participated in the Third Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter held at [[Purdue University]], [[West Lafayette, Indiana]].<ref>"Emptiness, Kenosis, History, and Dialogue: The Christian Response to Masao Abe's Notion of 'Dynamic Sunyata' in the Early Years of the Abe-Cobb Buddhist-Christian Dialogue", ''Buddhist-Christian Studies'', Vol. 24, 2004.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the early 1990s, Küng initiated a project called ''Weltethos'' ("Global Ethic"), which is an attempt at describing what the world's religions have in common (rather than what separates them) and at drawing up a minimal code of rules of behaviour everyone can accept. His vision of a global ethic was embodied in the document for which he wrote the initial draft, ''[[Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration]]''. This Declaration was signed at the 1993 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] by religious and spiritual leaders from around the world. Later Küng's project would culminate in the UN's ''[[Dialogue Among Civilizations]]'' to which Küng was assigned as one of 19 "eminent persons." Even though it was completed shortly after the terrorist attacks of [[9/11]] (in September 2001), it was not covered in the U.S. media, about which Küng complained.<ref>[http://weltethos.org/dat_eng/index_e.htm Global Ethic Foundation]</ref><ref>[http://www.un.org/Dialogue/Kung.html UN \u2013 Short Biography]</ref><ref>[http://lexnews.free.fr Hans Küng Interview (Revue Lexnews)]</ref>\u000a\u000aIn March 1991, he gave a talk titled "No Peace Among Nations until Peace Among the Religions" at [[UCSD]]'s [[Price Center]]. He visited the nearby Beth El synagogue and spoke there on modern German-Jewish relations.<ref>"Noted theologian Hans Kung to speak at USCD, synagogue", Rita Gillmon. [[The San Diego Union]] San Diego, Calif.: 9 March 1991. pg. B.11</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1998, he published ''Dying with Dignity'', co-written with Walter Jens, in which he affirms acceptance of euthanasia from a Christian viewpoint.\u000a\u000aIn 2003, Küng saw the beatification of [[Pope Pius IX]] as evidence of the degeneration of canonizations to "gestures of church politics".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Küng|first=Hans|title=The Catholic Church: a short history|year=2003|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-6762-3|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/?id=amtEJd_4Y9wC&pg=PA173}}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 2005, Küng published a critical article in Italy and Germany on "The failures of Pope Wojtyla" in which he argued that the world had expected a period of conversion, reform, and dialogue but, instead, [[John Paul II]] offered a restoration of the pre-Vatican II status quo\u2014thus blocking reform and inter-church dialogue and reasserting the absolute dominion of Rome.\u000a\u000aOn 26 September 2005, he had a friendly discussion about Catholic theology over dinner with [[Pope Benedict XVI]], surprising some observers.<ref>"Pope's September surprise" [home edition] John L. Allen Jr., [[Los Angeles Times]], 30 October 2005, pg. M.5</ref>\u000a\u000aNevertheless, in a 2009 interview with ''Le Monde'', Küng deeply criticised the lifting of the excommunications on the bishops of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]]. The interview drew a rebuke from Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]].<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900892.htm Theologian's criticism of pope draws Vatican response]</ref>\u000a\u000aBased on ''Studium Generale'' lectures at Tübingen University, his latest publication, ''Der Anfang aller Dinge'' (''The beginning of all things''), discusses the relationship between [[science and religion]]. In an analysis spanning from [[quantum physics]] to [[neuroscience]], he comments on the current debate about [[evolution]] in the United States, dismissing those opposed to the teaching of evolution as "naive [and] un-enlightened."{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\u000a\u000aIn his 2010 book ''Was ich glaube'', he describes his own personal relationship with nature, how he learned to observe correctly, drawing strength from God's creation without falling victim to a false and fanatic love of nature.\u000a\u000aIn April 2010, he published in several newspapers an open letter<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2010/04/hans_kung_points_finger_at_the.html "Open letter to Catholic bishops"], BBC website.</ref> to all Catholic bishops. In the letter he criticized Pope Benedict's handling of liturgical, collegial and inter-religious issues and also the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. In the letter, he called on bishops to consider six proposals, ranging from speaking up and working on regional solutions to calling for another Vatican council.\u000a\u000aHe is a signatary of [[Church 2011]], a German-language memorandum promulgated by Catholic theology professors.<ref>[http://www.memorandum-freiheit.de/?page_id=390 List of ''Church 2001'' signatories]</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Küng wrote in ''Erlebte Menschlichkeit'' ("Experienced Humanity") that he believed people had the right to end their own lives if physical illness, pain, or dementia made living unbearable. He further wrote that he was considering the option of [[assisted suicide]] for himself as he was suffering from [[Parkinson's Disease]] and was losing the ability to see and write with his hands. Küng wrote that he did not wish to follow the example of John Paul II in this case.<ref>{{Citation | author = Heneghan, Thomas | date = 3 October 2013 | title = Catholic rebel Kueng, 85, considers assisted suicide | publisher = Reuters | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/03/us-religion-kueng-suicide-idUSBRE9920HX20131003 | accessdate = 5 October 2013}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Awards==\u000a* 1991 Swiss culture prize;\u000a* 1992 [[Karl Barth]] prize;\u000a* 1998 [[Theodor Heuss]] Foundation prize;\u000a* 1998 Interfaith gold medallion from the International Council of Christianity and Judaism, London;\u000a* 1999 Federation of Lutheran cities prize;\u000a* 2000 GLOBArt Award;\u000a* 2001 Planetary Consciousness Prize from the Club of [[Budapest]];\u000a* 2003 Grand [[Federal Cross of Merit|Order of Merit]] with star\u000a* 2004 [[German Druiden medal]] from the Weltethos Foundation\u000a* 2005 [[Niwano Peace Prize]]\u000a* 2005 Baden-Wuerttemberg medal\u000a* 2006 Lew Kopelew prize\u000a* 2007 German freemasonry cultural prize\u000a* 2007 Honorary Citizen of [[Tübingen|City of Tübingen]]\u000a* 2008 Honour for civil courage by the circle of friends [[Heinrich Heine]] (Düsseldorf)\u000a* 2008 [[Otto Hahn Peace Medal]] in Gold from the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin, for "''outstanding services to peace and international understanding, especially for his exemplary employment for humanity, tolerance and the dialogue between the great world religions''".\u000a* 2009 Abraham Geiger prize from the [[Abraham-Geiger-Kolleg]] at the [[University of Potsdam]].\u000a*2011 Doctor Honoris Causa by the U.N.E.D.(Universidad de Educación a Distancia) Madrid\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[Parliament of the World's Religions]]\u000a*[[Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration]]\u000a\u000a==Writings==\u000aEnglish translations:\u000a\u000a*''Justification: The Doctrine of Karl Barth and a Catholic Reflection'', (org. 1964), (40th Ann.
