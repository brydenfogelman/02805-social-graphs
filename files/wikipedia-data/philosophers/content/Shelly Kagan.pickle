Specifically, the book questions the assumption that morality rules out certain actions (such as harming innocent people) even in situations where doing so might create greater good, and the assumption that individuals are "not required to make our greatest possible contribution to the overall good."  According to Kagan, these two assumptions are indefensible, despite their widespread appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/0198239165.001.0001|title=The Limits of Morality|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=Clark/> \u000a\u000aIn 1997, Kagan published a textbook titled ''Normative Ethics,'' designed to provide a thorough introduction to the subject for upper-level undergraduate or graduates students.<ref name="yale.edu">{{cite web|url=http://campuspress.yale.edu/shellykagan/books/|title=Books - Shelly Kagan|publisher=}}</ref> In the spring of 2007, his Yale course "Death" was recorded for [[Open Yale Courses]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176|title=Open Yale Courses - Death|publisher=}}</ref> and the book ''Death'' is based on these lectures.<ref name="yale-page"/> In 2010, Yale University reported Kagan's "Death" course had made him one of the most popular foreign teachers in China.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kagan\u2019s \u2018Death\u2019 class has made him a \u2018star\u2019 in China|url=http://news.yale.edu/2010/10/06/kagan-s-death-class-has-made-him-star-china|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\u000a\u000aKagan also explored the concept of [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], which is a philosophical concept of what individuals do or do not deserve, in his 2012 book ''The Geometry of Desert.''<ref name="yale.edu"/>\u000a\u000aKagan has served as a member of the editorial board of the journal ''[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]''.<ref name=Clark/> In 2016, he was made a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://philosophy.yale.edu/news/prof-shelly-kagan-fellow-american-academy-arts-and-sciences Blog Post] (Yale University Philosophy Department)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a* ''The Limits of Morality'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989.
