V[[Image:Francisco vitoria.jpg|thumb|Francisco de Vitoria]]\u000a\u000a'''Francisco de Vitoria''' (or '''Victoria'''), [[Dominican Order|OP]] (c. 1483, [[Burgos]] or [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] \u2013 12 August 1546, [[Salamanca]]), was a Spanish [[Renaissance]] Roman Catholic [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[theology|theologian]] and jurist. He is the founder of the tradition in [[philosophy]] known as the [[School of Salamanca]], noted especially for his contributions to the theory of [[just war]] and [[international law]]. He has in the past been described by some scholars as one of the "fathers of international law", along with [[Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]], though contemporary academics have suggested that such a description is [[anachronistic]], since the concept of international law did not truly develop until much later.<ref name="Woods">{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Thomas E.

He went on to teach theology from 1516 (under the influences of [[Pierre Crockaert]] and [[Thomas Cajetan]]). In 1522 he returned to [[Spain]] to teach theology at the college of Saint Gregory at [[Valladolid]], where many young Dominicans were being trained for missionary work in the New World. In 1524, he was elected to the Chair of theology at the [[University of Salamanca]], where he was instrumental in promoting [[Thomism]] (the philosophy and theology of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]). Francisco died in August 1546.<ref name=Schroeder>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06232a.htm Schroeder, Henry Joseph. "Francis of Vittoria." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6.

He worked to limit the type of power the Spanish empire imposed on the Native Peoples. He said, "The upshot of all the preceding is this, then, that the aborigines undoubtedly had true dominion in both public and private matters, just like Christians, and that neither their princes nor private persons could be despoiled of their property on the ground of their not being true owners."<ref>Francisco de Vitoria, \u201cThe Law of War,\u201d in War and Christian Ethics, ed.

His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.\u000a\u000aIn three lectures (relectiones) held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. This had already been the position of Palacios Rubios. Neither the pope nor Charles V had a rightful claim over Indian lives or property. No violent action could be taken against them, nor could their lands or property be seized, unless the Indians had caused harm or injury to the Spanish by violating the latter\u2019s lawful rights.<ref name=Pagden/>\u000a\u000aA supporter of the [[just war theory]], in ''De iure belli'' Fransico pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a "just war" were "wholly lacking in the Indies".<ref name=Salas>[http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf Salas Jr., Victor M., "Francisco de Vitoria on the ''Ius Gentium'' and the American Indios", ''Ave Maria Law Review'', 2012]</ref> The only area where he saw justification for Spanish \u000aintervention in native affairs was to protect victims seized for human sacrifice, and because of the inherent human dignity of the victims themselves\u2014whose rights were being violated and thus in need of defense.<ref name=Salas/>\u000a\u000a[[Thomas Woods|Thomas E.

The "Requerimiento", declared the universal authority of the Pope, and the\u000aauthority the Spanish monarchs had received from the Pope over this part of the New World for the purpose of colonizing and evangelizing it. The Indians had to accept the sovereignty of the Spanish monarchs or be compelled to submit by force.
