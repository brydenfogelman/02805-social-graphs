His writing, which included essays, novels, and poetry, explored such subjects as [[eroticism]], [[mysticism]], [[surrealism]], and [[Transgressive fiction|transgression]]. His work would prove influential on subsequent schools of philosophy and social theory, including [[poststructuralism]].<ref>Michael Richardson, [https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/georges-bataille-essential-writings/book206155 ''Georges Bataille: Essential Writings''], SAGE, 1998, p. 232.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Life and work==\u000a{{French literature sidebar}}\u000aGeorges Bataille was the son of Joseph-Aristide Bataille (b. 1851), a [[tax collector]] (later to go blind and paralysed on account of [[neurosyphilis]]), and Antoinette-Aglaë Tournarde (b. 1865). Born in [[Billom]] in the region of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], his family moved to [[Reims]] in 1898, where he was baptized.<ref>This fact is not mentioned in the biography by Michel Surya, but see the Chronology in Georges Bataille, ''Romans et récits'', Pléiade, 2004, p. xciv.</ref> He went to school in [[Reims]] and then [[Épernay]]. Although brought up without religious observance, he converted to Catholicism in 1914, and became a devout Catholic for about nine years. He considered entering the [[priest]]hood and attended a Catholic seminary briefly. However, he quit, apparently in part in order to pursue an occupation where he could eventually support his mother. He eventually renounced Christianity in the early 1920s.<ref>Michel Surya, ''Georges Bataille: an intellectual biography'', 2002; Georges Bataille, ''Choix de lettres'' (Paris: NRF), 1997.</ref>\u000a\u000aBataille attended the [[École Nationale des Chartes]] in [[Paris]], graduating in February 1922. Though he is often referred to as an [[archivist]] and a [[librarian]] because of his employment at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], his work there was with the medallion collections (he also published scholarly articles on [[numismatics]]). His thesis at the École des Chartes was a critical edition of the medieval manuscript ''L\u2019Ordre de chevalerie'' which he produced directly by classifying the eight manuscripts from which he reconstructed the poem. After graduating he moved to the School of Advanced Spanish Studies in [[Madrid]]. As a young man, he befriended, and was much influenced by, the Russian existentialist, [[Lev Shestov]].\u000a\u000aFounder of several journals and literary groups, Bataille is the author of a large and diverse body of work: readings, poems, essays on innumerable subjects (on the [[mysticism]] of economy, [[poetry]], philosophy, the arts, eroticism). He sometimes published under pseudonyms, and some of his publications were banned.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He was relatively ignored during his lifetime and scorned by contemporaries such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] as an advocate of [[mysticism]], but after his death had considerable influence on authors such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Philippe Sollers]], and [[Jacques Derrida]], all of whom were affiliated with the journal ''[[Tel Quel]]''. His influence is felt most explicitly in the phenomenological work of [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], but is also significant for the work of [[Jean Baudrillard]], the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories of [[Jacques Lacan]]<ref>Amine Benabdallah, [https://www.academia.edu/17883271/Georges_Bataille_et_le_fascisme_Vers_une_approche_psychanalytique_du_concept_dHomo_Sacer "Georges Bataille et le fascisme: Vers une approche psychanalytique du concept d'Homo Sacer"].</ref> and [[Julia Kristeva]], and recent anthropological work from the likes of [[Michael Taussig]].\u000a\u000aInitially attracted to [[Surrealism]], Bataille quickly fell out with its founder [[André Breton]], although Bataille and the Surrealists resumed cautiously cordial relations after [[World War II]]. Bataille was a member of the extremely influential [[College of Sociology]] which included several other renegade surrealists. He was heavily influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Marcel Mauss]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Alexandre Kojève]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>In an 'Autobiographical Note', Bataille describes his encounter with Nietzsche's writings in 1923 as "decisive" (Georges Bataille, ''My Mother, Madame Edwarda, The Dead Man'', trans.

"[http://i.a.m.free.fr/acephale/nietzsheetlesfascistes.html Nietzsche and Fascists]", ''[[Acéphale]]'', January 1937'</ref>\u000a\u000aFascinated by [[human sacrifice]], he founded a secret society, ''[[Acéphale]]'', the symbol of which was a headless man. According to legend, Bataille and the other members of Acéphale each agreed to be the sacrificial victim as an inauguration; none of them would agree to be the executioner. An indemnity was offered for an executioner, but none was found before the dissolution of Acéphale shortly before the war. The group also published an eponymous review of Nietzsche's philosophy which attempted to postulate what Derrida has called an "anti-[[sovereignty]]". Collaborators in these projects included [[André Masson]], [[Pierre Klossowski]], [[Roger Caillois]], [[:Fr:Jules Monnerot|Jules Monnerot]], [[Jean Rollin]] and [[Jean Wahl]].\u000a\u000aBataille drew from diverse influences and used various modes of discourse to create his work. His novel ''[[Story of the Eye]]'' (''Histoire de l'oeil''), published under the pseudonym Lord Auch (literally, Lord "to the shithouse" \u2014 "auch" being short for "aux chiottes," slang for telling somebody off by sending him to the toilet), was initially read as pure [[pornography]], while interpretation of the work has gradually matured to reveal the same considerable philosophical and emotional depth that is characteristic of other writers who have been categorized within "[[transgressional fiction|literature of transgression]]". The imagery of the novel is built upon a series of metaphors which in turn refer to philosophical constructs developed in his work: the [[eye]], the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], the [[sun]], the [[earth]], the [[testicle]].\u000a\u000aOther famous novels include the [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously published]] ''My Mother'' (which would become the basis of [[Christophe Honoré]]'s film ''[[Ma Mère]]''), ''The Impossible'' and ''[[Blue of Noon]]'', which, with its [[incest]], [[necrophilia]],<ref name=kendall>{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Stuart|title=Georges Bataille|date=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1861893272|page=206|edition=1. publ.|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=1861893272|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> politics, and autobiographical undertones, is a much darker treatment of contemporary historical reality.\u000a\u000aDuring World War II Bataille produced ''Summa Atheologica'' (the title parallels [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologica]]'') which comprises his works ''[[Inner Experience]]'', ''Guilty'', and ''On Nietzsche''. After the war he composed ''[[La Part maudite|The Accursed Share]]'', which he said represented thirty years' work. The singular conception of "[[sovereignty]]" expounded there would become an important topic of discussion for Derrida, [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and others. Bataille also founded the influential journal ''Critique''.\u000a\u000aBataille's first marriage was to actress [[Sylvia Bataille|Silvia Maklès]], in 1928; they divorced in 1934, and she later married the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. Bataille also had an affair with [[Colette Peignot]], who died in 1938. In 1946 Bataille married Diane de Beauharnais, with whom he had a daughter.\u000a\u000aIn 1955 Bataille was diagnosed with cerebral arteriosclerosis, although he was not informed at the time of the terminal nature of his illness.<ref>Surya, Michel. ''Georges Bataille: An Intellectual Biography'', 2002, p. 474.</ref> He died seven years later, on 9 July 1962.\u000a\u000a==Key concepts==\u000a===Base materialism===\u000aBataille developed base materialism during the late 1920s and early 1930s as an attempt to break with mainstream [[materialism]]. He argues for the concept of an active base matter that disrupts the opposition of high and low and destabilises all foundations. In a sense the concept is similar to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[neutral monism]] of a [[Substance theory|substance]] that encompasses both the mind and the matter posited by [[René Descartes]]; however, it defies strict definition and remains in the realm of experience rather than rationalisation. Base materialism was a major influence on Derrida's [[deconstruction]], and both thinkers attempt to destabilise philosophical oppositions by means of an unstable "third term." Bataille's notion of materialism may also be seen as anticipating [[Louis Althusser]]'s conception of aleatory materialism or "materialism of the encounter," which draws on similar atomist metaphors to sketch a world in which causality and actuality are abandoned in favor of limitless possibilities of action.\u000a\u000a===The accursed share===\u000a''La Part maudite'' is a book written by Bataille between 1946 and 1949, when it was published by Les Éditions de Minuit. It was translated into English and published in 1991, with the title ''The Accursed Share''. It presents a new economic theory, which Bataille calls "general economy," as distinct from the "restricted" economic perspective of most economic theory. Thus, in the theoretical introduction, Bataille writes the following:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>I will simply state, without waiting further, that the extension of economic growth itself requires the overturning of economic principles\u2014the overturning of the ethics that grounds them. Changing from the perspectives of restrictive economy to those of general economy actually accomplishes a Copernican transformation: a reversal of thinking\u2014and of ethics. If a part of wealth (subject to a rough estimate) is doomed to destruction or at least to unproductive use without any possible profit, it is logical, even inescapable, to surrender commodities without return. Henceforth, leaving aside pure and simple dissipation, analogous to the construction of the Pyramids, the possibility of pursuing growth is itself subordinated to giving: The industrial development of the entire world demands of Americans that they lucidly grasp the necessity, for an economy such as theirs, of having a margin of profitless operations. An immense industrial network cannot be managed in the same way that one changes a tire\u2026 It expresses a circuit of cosmic energy on which it depends, which it cannot limit, and whose laws it cannot ignore without consequences. Woe to those who, to the very end, insist on regulating the movement that exceeds them with the narrow mind of the mechanic who changes a tire.<ref>Georges Bataille, The Accursed Share, Volume 1: Consumption, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Zone Books, 1991). ISBN 9780942299205.</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aThus, according to Bataille's theory of consumption, the accursed share is that excessive and non-recuperable part of any economy which is destined to one of two modes of economic and social expenditure. This must either be spent luxuriously and knowingly without gain in the arts, in non-procreative sexuality, in spectacles and sumptuous monuments, or it is obliviously destined to an outrageous and catastrophic outpouring in war.\u000a\u000aThe notion of "excess" energy is central to Bataille's thinking. Bataille's inquiry takes the superabundance of energy, beginning from the infinite outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by life's basic chemical reactions, as the norm for organisms. In other words, an organism in Bataille's general economy, unlike the rational actors of classical economy who are motivated by scarcity, normally has an "excess" of energy available to it. This extra energy can be used productively for the organism's growth or it can be lavishly expended. Bataille insists that an organism's growth or expansion always runs up against limits and becomes impossible. The wasting of this energy is "luxury." The form and role luxury assumes in a society are characteristic of that society. "The accursed share" refers to this excess, destined for waste.\u000a\u000aCrucial to the formulation of the theory was Bataille's reflection upon the phenomenon of potlatch. It is influenced by [[Marcel Mauss]]'s ''The Gift'', as well as by Friedrich Nietzsche's ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]''.\u000a\u000a===Other===\u000a{{Columns-list|3|\u000a* [[La Part maudite|The accursed share]]\u000a* [[Erotism]]\u000a* [[Heterogeneous matter]]\u000a* [[Immanence]]\u000a* [[Limit-experience]]\u000a* [[Pineal gland|The Pineal Eye]]\u000a* [[Sovereignty]]\u000a* [[Sacred (comparative religion)|The Sacred]]\u000a* [[Slow slicing]]\u000a* [[The Solar Anus]]\u000a* [[Taboo|Transgression]]\u000a}}\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a'''Complete works'''\u000a* Georges Bataille, ''\u0152uvres complètes'' (Paris: Gallimard):\u000a** Volume 1: Premiers écrits, 1922\u20131940: ''Histoire de l'\u0153il - L'Anus solaire - Sacrifices - Articles''\u000a** Volume 2: Écrits posthumes, 1922\u20131940\u000a** Volume 3: \u0152uvres littéraires: ''Madame Edwarda - Le Petit - L'Archangélique - L'Impossible - La Scissiparité - L'Abbé C. - L'être indifférencié n'est rien - Le Bleu du ciel''\u000a** Volume 4: \u0152uvres littéraires posthumes: ''Poèmes - Le Mort - Julie - La Maison brûlée - La Tombe de Louis XXX - Divinus Deus - Ébauches''\u000a** Volume 5: La Somme athéologique I: ''L'Expérience intérieure - Méthode de méditation - Post-scriptum 1953 - Le Coupable - L'Alleluiah''\u000a** Volume 6: La Somme athéologique II: ''Sur Nietzsche - Mémorandum - Annexes''\u000a** Volume 7: ''L'économie à la mesure de l'univers - La Part maudite - La limite de l'utile (Fragments) - Théorie de la Religion - Conférences 1947-1948 - Annexes''\u000a** Volume 8: ''L'Histoire de l'érotisme - Le surréalisme au jour le jour - Conférences 1951-1953 - La Souveraineté - Annexes''\u000a** Volume 9: ''Lascaux, ou La naissance de l\u2019art - Manet - La littérature et le mal - Annexes''\u000a** Volume 10: ''L\u2019érotisme - Le procès de Gilles de Rais - Les larmes d\u2019Eros''\u000a** Volume 11: Articles I, 1944\u20131949\u000a** Volume 12: Articles II, 1950\u20131961\u000a* ''Georges Bataille: Une liberté souveraine: Textes et entretiens'', 2004 (articles, book reviews and interviews not included in ''Oeuvres Complètes'', Michel Surya Ed.)\u000a\u000a'''Works published in French'''\u000a* ''[[Story of the Eye|Histoire de l'oeil]]'', 1928 (Story of the Eye) (under pseudonym of Lord Auch)\u000a* ''[[The Solar Anus|L'Anus solaire]]'', 1931 (The Solar Anus)\u000a* ''The Notion of Expenditure'', 1933\u000a* ''L'Amitié'', 1940 (Friendship) (under pseudonym of Dianus; early version of Part One of Le Coupable)\u000a* ''Madame Edwarda'', 1941 (under pseudonym of Pierre Angélique, fictitiously dated 1937; 2nd Edition: 1945; 3rd Edition: 1956 published with preface in Bataille's name)<ref>Georges Bataille, ''Madame Edwarda'' in ''\u0152uvres complètes'', tome III, Paris, Gallimard, 1971, notes, p. 491.</ref>\u000a* ''Le Petit'', 1943 (under pseudonym of Louis Trente; fictitious publication date of 1934)\u000a* ''[[L'expérience intérieure]]'', 1943 (Inner Experience)\u000a* ''L'Archangélique'', 1944 (The Archangelical)\u000a* ''Le Coupable'', 1944 (Guilty)\u000a* ''Sur Nietzsche'', 1945 (On [[Nietzsche]])\u000a* ''Dirty'', 1945\u000a* ''L'Orestie'', 1945 (The Oresteia)\u000a* ''Histoire de rats'', 1947 (A Story of Rats)\u000a* ''L'Alleluiah'', 1947 (Alleluia: The Catechism of Dianus)\u000a* ''Méthode de méditation'', 1947 (Method of Meditation)\u000a* ''La Haine de la Poésie'', 1947 (The Hatred of Poetry; reissued in 1962 as The Impossible)\u000a* ''La Scissiparité'', 1949 (The Scission)\u000a* ''[[La Part maudite]]'', 1949 (The Accursed Share)\u000a* ''[[L'Abbé C]]'', 1950\u000a* ''L'expérience intérieure'', 1954 (second edition of Inner Experience, followed by Method of Meditation and Post-scriptum 1953)\u000a* ''L'Être indifférencié n'est rien'', 1954 (Undifferentiated Being is Nothing)\u000a* ''Lascaux, ou la Naissance de l'Art'', 1955\u000a* ''Manet'', 1955\u000a*''Le paradoxe de l'érotisme'', Nouvelle Revue Française, n°29, 1er Mai 1955.\u000a* ''[[Le Bleu du ciel]]'', 1957 (written 1935\u201336) (Blue of Noon)\u000a* ''La littérature et le Mal'', 1957 (Literature and Evil)\u000a* ''L'Erotisme'', 1957 (Erotism)\u000a* ''Le Coupable'', 1961 (Guilty, second, revised edition, followed by Alleluia: The Catechism of Dianus)\u000a* ''Les larmes d'Éros'', 1961 (The Tears of Eros)\u000a* ''L'Impossible : Histoire de rats suivi de Dianus et de L'Orestie'', 1962 (The Impossible)\u000a\u000a'''Posthumous works'''\u000a* ''Ma Mère'', 1966 (My Mother)\u000a* ''Le Mort'', 1967 (The Dead Man)\u000a* ''Théorie de la Religion'', 1973 (Theory of Religion)\u000a\u000a'''Translated works'''\u000a* ''Lascaux; or, the Birth of Art, the Prehistoric Paintings'', Austryn Wainhouse, 1955, Lausanne: Skira.\u000a* ''Manet'', Austryn Wainhouse and James Emmons, 1955, Editions d'Art Albert Skira.\u000a* ''Literature and Evil'', Alastair Hamilton, 1973, Calder & Boyars Ltd.\u000a* ''Visions of Excess: Selected Writings 1927-1939'', Allan Stoekl, Carl R.
