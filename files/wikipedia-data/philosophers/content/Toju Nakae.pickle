V__NOTOC__\u000a{{Japanese name|Nakae}}\u000a[[image:Nakae Toju portrait.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Nakae T\u014dju]]\u000a{{nihongo|'''Toju Nakae'''|\u4e2d\u6c5f \u85e4\u6a39|Nakae T\u014dju|21 April 1608 \u2013 11 October 1648}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] known as "the sage of [[\u014cmi Province|\u014cmi]]".\u000a\u000aNakae was a [[Feudalism|feudal]] retainer who lived during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  He taught that the highest virtue was [[filial piety]] (''k\u014d''), and acted upon this, giving up his official post in 1634 in order to return to his home in [[Takashima District, Shiga|Takashima]], \u014cmi to care of his mother.  He distinguished, however, between ''sho-k\u014d'' and ''dai-k\u014d'': lesser and greater filial piety.  ''Sho-k\u014d'' involves the normal care owed by children to their parents; ''dai-k\u014d'' involves the notion that our human parents are themselves the children of the divine parents &mdash; thus, if one's parents are wrong, then one should encourage them to return to virtue.\u000a\u000aHe was unusual in believing that his teaching would be useful to women as well as men.  While accepting the then standard view of women as usually lacking such virtues as compassion and honesty, he argued: "if a wife's disposition is healthy and pious, obedient, sympathetic and honest, then ... every member of her family will be at peace and the entire household in perfect order."<ref>Bodart-Bailey, Beatrice.

''Neo-Confucian Orthodoxy and the Learning of the Mind-and-Heart,'' p. 372.</ref>\u000a\u000aNakae originally followed the teachings of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] philosopher [[Zhu Xi]], but eventually became more influenced by [[Wang Yangming]] (1472&ndash;1529), who argued for the primacy of human intuition or conscience over intellect: moral improvement arises out of conscience-based action (compare [[Aristotle's ethics]]).  Nakae added a more religious aspect to Wang's "School of Intuition of Mind", calling the human conscience the "divine light of heaven".  Nakae's works also supplied his followers (such as [[Kumazawa Banzan]] [1619&ndash;1691]) with "the moral foundation for political action".<ref>Bodart-Bailey, p. 741.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Selected works==\u000aIn a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Toju Nakae, [[OCLC]]/[[WorldCat]] encompasses roughly 130+ works in 200 publications in 5 languages and 740+ library holdings.<ref>[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm  WorldCat Identities]: [http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-127208  \u4e2d\u6c5f\u85e4\u6a39 1608-1648]</ref>\u000a{{dynamic list}}\u000a* 1650 -- ''Dialogue with the elder'' (''Okina mond\u014d'').<ref>Shirane, Haruo.
