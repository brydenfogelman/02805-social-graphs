It was intended that he should study Protestant theology, but from 1798 he devoted himself in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] to the study of law, philosophy, and natural science. He was a student of [[Gustav Hugo]]. Returning to Berlin, he was persuaded by his friend [[Friedrich von Gentz]] to take up [[political science]]. He had early formed a close intimacy with Gentz, his elder by 15 years; and this connection exercised an important influence both on his material circumstances and his mental development in after life. The two men differed widely in character and in their fundamental principles, but agreed, at least in their later period, in their practical political aims, and the friendship was only terminated by death.\u000a\u000aMüller worked for some time as referendary in the ''Kurmärkische Kammer'' in Berlin. Müller's relations with the [[Junker]] party and his co-operation with them in their opposition to [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]]'s reforms made any public employment in [[Prussia]] impossible for him. He travelled in Sweden and Denmark, spent about two years in Poland, and then went to [[Vienna]], where he was [[religious conversion|converted]] to the Catholic faith on 30 April 1805.<ref name="SchPR">{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=tr. Guy Oakes|title=Political Romanticism|year=2011|publisher=Transaction|isbn=9781412814720|pages=42\u201344}}</ref> Through Gentz he became acquainted with [[Metternich]], to whom he was useful in the preparation of state papers.\u000a\u000a===Career===\u000aFrom 1806 to 1809, he lived at [[Dresden]] occupied in the political education of [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792\u20131862)|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and lecturer on [[German literature]], dramatic art, and political science. In 1808 he edited with [[Heinrich von Kleist]] the periodical ''Phoebus''.<ref name="SchPR"/> In 1809, he returned to Berlin, and in 1811 to Vienna, where he lived in the house of [[Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este]] and became the friend of [[Clemens Maria Hofbauer]].\u000a\u000aIn 1813, he entered the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] service, and was appointed imperial commissioner and major of the rifle corps in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. He took part in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|wars for liberty]], and later on, as counsellor of the government, in the reorganization of the country. In 1815 he was called to Vienna, and went to Paris with the imperial staff.\u000a\u000aOn the conclusion of peace, he became Austrian consul-general for [[Saxony]] at [[Leipzig]], and agent for [[Anhalt]] and [[Schwarzburg]]{{dn|date=August 2015}}. He edited here the periodicals ''Deutscher Staatsanzeiger'' (1816\u20131818) and ''Unparteiischer Literatur- und Kirchenkorrespondent''. He attended the ministerial conferences at [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] and Vienna (1819\u20131820), where, being one of the principal literary instruments of the [[reactionary|reaction]], he took part in framing the [[Carlsbad Decrees|Carlsbad resolutions]]. In 1826, at the instance of [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince von Metternich]], he was ennobled as '''Ritter von Nittersdorf''', was recalled to Vienna (1827), appointed imperial counsellor, and employed in the service of the [[chancellor of Austria|chancellery]]. He died in Vienna in 1829, aged 49.\u000a\u000a==Positions and theories==\u000a[[Image:Adam Heinrich Müller.jpg|thumb|left|Adam Heinrich Müller c. 1810]]\u000aMüller was distinguished as a writer not only on politics and economics, but on literature and aesthetics. His chief work is the ''{{lang|de|Elemente der Staatskunst}}'' (''Elements of Statecraft''), originating in lectures delivered before [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792\u20131862)|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and an assembly of politicians and diplomats at Dresden in the winter, 1808-09. It treats in six books of the state, of right, of the spirit of legislation in antiquity and in the [[Middle Ages]], of money and national wealth, of the economical factors of the state and trade, of the relation between the state and religion. Müller endeavoured to comprehend the connexion between political and social science, and, while using the [[historical method]], to base them upon philosophy and religion. (Cf. the preface to the first volume of the ''Elemente'', where he treats exhaustively the differences between his work and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''{{lang|fr|De l'esprit des lois}}''; cf. also the sixth book of this work, and the above-mentioned work of 1820.) With [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich von Gentz]], [[Joseph de Maistre]], and [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]], he must be reckoned among the chief opponents of revolutionary ideas in politics.\u000a\u000aIn his work, ''{{lang|de|Von der Notwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundlage der gesamten Staatswissenschaften}}'' (''On the necessity of a comprehensive theological foundation for political science'', 1820), Müller rejects, like Haller (''{{lang|de|Restauration der Staatswissenschaften}}'', 1816), the distinction between [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[civil law (common law)]], which rests entirely on the idea of the state's omnipotence. His ideal is [[medieval]] [[feudalism]], on which the reorganization of modern political institutions should be modelled.\u000a\u000a===Romanticist===\u000aIn the field of literature and [[aesthetics]], Müller belongs to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] school. He is a Romanticist even in his specialty, politics and political economy. As [[Joseph von Eichendorff|Eichendorff]] says in his ''Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands'' (new ed., by W. Kosch, Kempten, 1906, p.&nbsp;352), Müller "mapped out a domain of his own, the application of [[Romanticism]] to the social and political conditions of life." [[Carl Schmitt]] presented the view that "it is impossible to judge Müller's theory of the state as anything but a matter of aesthetics and style."<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=tr. Guy Oakes|title=Political Romanticism|year=2011|publisher=Transaction|isbn=9781412814720|page=141}}</ref>  Müller himself declares: "The reconciliation of science and art and of their noblest ideas with serious political life was the purpose of my larger works" (''Vermischte Schriften'', I, p. iii).\u000a\u000a===Economics===\u000aHis position in [[political economy]] is defined by his strong opposition to [[Adam Smith]]'s system of materialistic-[[liberalism|liberal]] (so-called classical) political economy, or the so-called [[industry system]]. He censures Smith as presenting a one-sidedly material and individualistic conception of society, and as being too exclusively English in his views. Müller is thus also an adversary of [[free trade]]. In contrast with the economical individualism of Adam Smith, he emphasizes the ethical element in national economy, the duty of the state toward the individual, and the religious basis which is also necessary in this field. Müller's importance in the history of political economy is acknowledged even by the opponents of his religious and political point of view. His reaction against Adam Smith, says [[Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher|Roscher]] (''Geschichte der National-Ökonomik'', p.&nbsp;763), "is not blind or hostile, but is important, and often truly helpful." Some of his ideas, freed from much of their alloy, are reproduced in the writings of the [[Historical school of economics|historical school of German economists]].\u000a\u000aThe [[reactionary]] and [[feudalism|feudalistic]] thought in Müller's writings, which agreed so little with the spirit of the times, prevented his political ideas from exerting a more notable and lasting influence on his age, while their religious character prevented them from being justly appreciated. However, Müller's teachings had long-term effects in that they were taken up again by 20th century theorists of [[corporatism]] and the [[corporate state]], for example [[Othmar Spann]] (''Der wahre Staat. Vorlesungen über Abbruch und Neubau der Gesellschaft'', Vienna, 1921).\u000a\u000a==Writings==\u000aMüller was a man of great and versatile talents, an excellent orator, and a suggestive writer. Several of his works were based upon his own lectures; the most important (besides the above-mentioned periodicals) are:\u000a\u000a*''Die Lehre vom Gegensatz'' (Berlin, 1804)\u000a*''Vorlesungen über die deutsche Wissenschaft und Literatur'' (Dresden, 1806, 2nd ed., 1807)\u000a*''Von der Idee der Schönheit'' (lectures; Berlin, 1809)\u000a*''Die Elemente der Staatskunst'' (lectures; 3 parts, Berlin, 1809)\u000a*''Über [[Frederick II of Prussia|König Friedrich II.]] und die Natur, Würde und Bestimmung der preußischen Monarchie'' (lectures; Berlin, 1810)\u000a*''Die Theorie der Staatshaushaltung und ihre Forschritte in Deutschland und England seit [[Adam Smith]]'' (2 vols., Vienna, 1812)\u000a*''Vermischte Schriften über Staat, Philosophie und Kunst'' (2 vols., Vienna, 1812; 2nd ed., 1817)\u000a*''Versuch einer neuen Theorie des Geldes, mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Großbritannien'' (Leipzig, 1816)\u000a*''Zwölf Reden über die Beredsamkeit und deren Verfall in Deutschland'' (Leipzig, 1817)\u000a*''Die Fortschritte der nationalökonomischen Wissenschaft in England'' (Leipzig, 1817)\u000a*''Von der Notwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundlage der gesamten Staatswissenschaften und der Staatswirtschaft insbesondere'' (Leipzig, 1820; new ed., Vienna, 1898)\u000a*''Die Gewerbe-Polizei in Beziehung auf den Landbau'' (Leipzig, 1824)\u000a*''Vorschlag zu einem historischen Ferien-Cursus'' (Vienna, 1829)\u000a\u000aA critical pamphlet, which was written in 1817 on the occasion of the Protestant jubilee of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and entitled, ''Etwas, das [[Goethe]] gesagt hat. Beleuchtet von Adam Müller. Leipzig, den 31 Oktober 1817'', was printed but not published (reprinted in Vienna, 1910). Nevertheless, [[Traugott Krug]]'s reply, entitled ''Etwas, das Herr Adam Müller gesagt hat über etwas, das Goethe gesagt hat, und noch etwas, das [[Martin Luther|Luther]] gesagt hat'' (Leipzig, 1817), appeared in two editions.\u000a\u000a==Notes==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a*{{Catholic|wstitle=Adam Heinrich Müller}}\u000a*{{Americana|wstitle=Müller, Adam Heinrich |year=1920}} This work in turn cites:\u000a**{{Cite ADB|22|501|511|Müller, Adam Heinrich|Ernst Mischler|ADB:Müller, Adam von}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a* [http://www.textkritik.de/bka/dokumente/dok_gentz/gentz.htm Correspondence] between Müller and [[Friedrich von Gentz|Gentz]] 1807/08\u000a* {{Internet Archive author |name=Ritter von Nitterdorf}}\u000a* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Adam Heinrich Müller |sopt=t}} \u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Muller, Adam Heinrich}}\u000a[[Category:1779 births]]\u000a[[Category:1829 deaths]]\u000a[[Category:Writers from Berlin]]\u000a[[Category:German literary critics]]\u000a[[Category:German opinion journalists]]\u000a[[Category:German political philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Philosophers of law]]\u000a[[Category:German Roman Catholics]]\u000a[[Category:German monarchists]]\u000a[[Category:Roman Catholic philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Evangelicalism]]\u000a[[Category:German expatriates in Austria]]\u000a[[Category:Austrian knights]]\u000a[[Category:19th-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:19th-century German writers]]\u000a[[Category:German philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:German male writers]]
