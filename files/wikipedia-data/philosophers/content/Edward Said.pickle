They certainly have no use for the Iraqi opposition that they\u2019ve been spending many millions of dollars on; and, to the best of my ability to judge, they are going to improvise; of course, the model is Afghanistan. I think they hope that the U.N. will come in and do something, but, given the recent French and Russian positions, I doubt that that will happen with such simplicity.<ref>Said, Edward.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/631/focus.htm "Resources of Hope"], Al-Ahram Weekly, 2 April 2003, accessed April 26, 2007.</ref>}}\u000a\u000a===Under surveillance===\u000aIn 2003, [[Haidar Abdel-Shafi]], Ibrahim Dakak, [[Mustafa Barghouti]], and Said established ''Al-Mubadara'' (The [[Palestinian National Initiative]]), headed by Dr. Mustafa Barghouti,  a third-party reformist, democratic party meant to be an alternative to the usual [[two-party system|two-party politics]] of Palestine.
