In 1857 he gained a bursary at [[Marischal College]], and graduated MA in 1861, with the highest honours in [[classics]] and [[philosophy]]. In the same year he won a [[Robert Fergusson|Fergusson]] scholarship of £100 a year for two years, which enabled him to pursue his studies outside Scotland. He went first to [[University College, London]]; at the [[University of Heidelberg]] he worked on his [[German language|German]]; at the [[Humboldt University]] in [[Berlin]] he studied [[psychology]], [[metaphysics]] and also [[physiology]] under [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], and heard lectures on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the history of philosophy, ancient and modern. After two months at the [[University of Göttingen]], he went to [[Paris]] in June 1863. In the same year he returned to Aberdeen and helped [[Alexander Bain]] with the revision of some of his books.\u000a\u000aIn 1864 he was appointed to help [[William Duguid Geddes]] with his [[Greek language|Greek]] classes, but he devoted his vacations to working on philosophy. In 1866 he was appointed professor of philosophy of mind and logic at University College, London. He remained there until he was forced by ill-health to resign a few months before his death, lecturing on [[logic]], deductive and inductive, systematic psychology and [[ethics]].\u000a\u000aHe left little published work. A comprehensive work on [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] was never completed, though part of the materials were used for an article in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], and another portion was published as one of [[William Blackwood|Blackwood]]'s "Philosophical Classics." Together with Bain, he edited [[George Grote]]'s ''[[Aristotle]]'', and was the editor of ''Mind'' from its foundation in 1876 till 1891.\u000aRobertson had a keen interest in German philosophy, and took every opportunity to make German works on English writers known in the [[United Kingdom]]. In philosophy he was principally a follower of Bain and [[John Stuart Mill]]. He and his wife (a daughter of Mr Justice Crompton) were involved in many kinds of social work; he sat on the Committee of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]], and was actively associated with its president, John Stuart Mill. He also supported the admission of women students to University College.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a* [http://fair-use.org/mind/1876/01/prefatory-words "Prefatory Words"], from ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', Volume I, Number 1 (January 1876).\u000a* [http://fair-use.org/mind/1876/01/critical-notices/clinical-and-physiological-researches-on-the-nervous-system Review of Hughlings Jackson's ''Researches on the Nervous System''], from ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', Volume I, Number 1 (January 1876).\u000a* [http://fair-use.org/mind/1876/01/critical-notices/the-character-and-logical-method-of-political-economy Review of Cairnes's ''Logical Method of Political Economy''], from ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', Volume I, Number 1 (January 1876).\u000a* [http://fair-use.org/mind/1876/01/notes/sense-of-doubleness-with-crossed-fingers "Sense of Doubleness with Crossed Fingers"], from ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', Volume I, Number 1 (January 1876).\u000a* [http://fair-use.org/mind/1876/01/notes/logic-and-the-elements-of-geometry "Logic and the Elements of Geometry"], from ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', Volume I, Number 1 (January 1876).\u000a* [https://archive.org/stream/mindreview03edinuoft#page/24/mode/2up "The Physical Basis of Mind,"] ''Mind'', Vol. III, 1878.\u000a* [https://archive.org/stream/mindreview03edinuoft#page/240/mode/2up "Philosophy in Education,"] ''Mind,'' Vol. III, 1878.\u000a* [https://archive.org/stream/mindreview08edinuoft#page/viii/mode/2up "Psychology and Philosophy,"] ''Mind,'' Vol. VIII, 1883.\u000a* [https://archive.org/details/hobbesrob00robuoft ''Hobbes''] (1886).\u000a* [https://archive.org/details/philosophicalrem00robeuoft ''Philosophical Remains ...: with a Memoir''] (1894)\u000a* [https://archive.org/details/elementsofconstr00robeuoft ''Elements of General Philosophy''] (1896).\u000a* [https://archive.org/details/elementsofpsycho00robeuoft ''Elements of Psychology''] (1896).\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Sources==\u000a* [[Alexander Bain]]: [https://archive.org/stream/nsmindrev02edinuoft#page/n15/mode/2up "George Croom Robertson"] ''Mind'' (N.
