At one time [[Leon Trotsky]]'s secretary, she later split with him and ultimately founded the organization [[News and Letters Committees]] and was its leader until her death.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aOf Jewish descent, Dunayevskaya was born Raya Shpigel in today's [[Ukraine]] and emigrated to the United States (her name changed to Rae Spiegel) and joined the revolutionary movement in her childhood. Active in the [[American Communist Party]] youth organization, she was expelled at age 18 and thrown down a flight of stairs when she suggested that her local comrades should find out Trotsky's response to his expulsion from the [[Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[Comintern]]. By the following year she found a group of independent Trotskyists in [[Boston]], led by [[Antoinette Buchholz Konikow]], an advocate of [[birth control]] and legal [[abortion]].<ref name="Women Building Chicago, p. 239">''Women Building Chicago'', p. 239.</ref> In the 1930s, she adopted her mother's maiden name Dunayevskaya.<ref>''Urbane Revolutionary: C. L. R. James and the Struggle for a New Society'', Frank Rosengarten, p. 65</ref>\u000a\u000aWithout getting permission from the U.S. Trotskyist organization, she went to [[Mexico]] in 1937 to serve as [[Leon Trotsky]]'s Russian language secretary during his [[exile]] there.<ref name="Women Building Chicago, p. 239"/> Having returned to Chicago in 1938 after the deaths of her father and brother, she broke with Trotsky in 1939 when he continued to maintain that the [[Soviet Union]] was a "[[workers' state]]" even after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. She opposed any notion that workers should be asked to defend this "workers' state" allied with [[Nazi Germany]] in a [[world war]]. Along with theorists such as [[C.L.R. James]], and later [[Tony Cliff]], Dunayevskaya argued that the Soviet Union had become '[[state capitalist]]'. Toward the end of her life, she stated that what she called "my real development" only began after her break with Trotsky.<ref>''Chicago Literary Review'', "Marxist-Humanism, an Interview with Raya Dunayevskaya," p. 16.</ref>\u000a\u000aHer simultaneous study of the Russian economy and of Marx's early writings (later known as the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''), led to her theory that not only was the [[U.S.S.R.]] a '[[state capitalist]]' society, but that '[[state capitalism]]' was a new world stage. Much of her initial analysis was published in ''The New International'' in 1942-1943.\u000a\u000aIn 1940, she was involved in the split in the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]] that led to the formation of the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] (WP), with which she shared an objection to Trotsky's characterisation of the Soviet Union as a '[[degenerated workers' state]]'. Within the WP, she formed the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] alongside [[C. L. R. James]] (she being "Freddie Forest" and he "J.R. Johnson", named for their party cadre names). The tendency argued that the Soviet Union was '[[state capitalism|state capitalist]]', while the WP majority maintained that it was [[bureaucratic collectivist]].\u000a\u000aDifferences within the WP steadily widened, and in 1947, after a brief period of independent existence during which they published a series of documents, the tendency returned to the ranks of the SWP. Their membership in the SWP was based on a shared insistence that there was a pre-revolutionary situation just around the corner, and the shared belief that a [[Leninist]] party must be in place to take advantage of the coming opportunities.\u000a\u000aBy 1951, with the failure of their shared perspective to materialize, the tendency developed a theory that rejected [[Leninism]] and saw the workers as being spontaneously revolutionary. This was borne out for them by the 1949 U.S. miners' strike. In later years, they were to pay close attention to [[automation]], especially in the [[automobile industry]], which they came to see as paradigmatic of a new stage of [[capitalism]]. This led to the tendency leaving the SWP again to begin independent work.\u000a\u000aAfter more than a decade of developing the theory of [[state capitalism]], Dunayevskaya continued her study of the Hegelian [[dialectic]] by taking on a task the Johnson-Forest Tendency had set itself: exploring [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Philosophy of Mind]]''. She advanced an interpretation of Hegel's [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolutes]] holding that they involved a dual movement: a movement from practice that is itself a form of theory and a movement from theory reaching to philosophy. She considered these 1953 letters to be "the philosophic moment" from which the whole development of [[Marxist Humanism]] flowed.\u000a\u000aIn 1953 Dunayevskaya moved to Detroit, where she was to live until 1984. In 1954-1955 she and C.L.R. James engaged in a split{{clarify|date=December 2014}}. In 1955, she founded her own organization, [[News and Letters Committees]], and a Marxist-Humanist newspaper, ''[[News & Letters]]'', which remains in publication today. The newspaper covers women's struggles, the liberation of workers, people of color, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual rights and the disability rights movement, while not separating that coverage from philosophical and theoretical articles.\u000a\u000aDunayevskaya wrote what came to be known as her "trilogy of revolution": ''[[Marxism and Freedom: From 1776 Until Today]]'' (1958), ''[[Philosophy and Revolution]]'' (1973), and ''[[Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution]]'' (1982).  In addition, she selected and introduced a collection of writings, published in 1985, ''Women's Liberation and the Dialectics of Revolution''.\u000a\u000aIn the last year of her life she was working on a new book which she had tentatively titled, ''Dialectics of Organization and Philosophy: The 'Party' and Forms of Organization Born Out of Spontaneity''.<ref>Many of her writings that were part of the process of work on the projected book are included in Volume XIII of the Supplement to the Raya Dunayevskaya Collection.</ref>\u000a\u000aRaya Dunayevskaya's speeches, letters, publications, notes, recordings and other items are located in the Walter P. Reuther Library at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]]. Microfilm copies of the collection are available from the WSU Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs. Guides to the collection are available from News and Letters Committees.\u000a\u000a==Quotations==\u000a* "He who glorifies theory and genius but fails to recognize the ''limits'' of a theoretical work, fails likewise to recognize the ''indispensability of the theoretician.''  All of history is the history of the struggle for freedom.  If, as a theoretician, one's ears are attuned to the new impulse from the workers, new "categories" will be created, a new way of thinking, a new step forward in philosophic cognition." \u2013from ''Marxism and Freedom''{{page needed|date=February 2015}}\u000a* "Precisely where Hegel sounds most abstract, seems to close the shutters tight against the whole movement of history, there he lets the lifeblood of the dialectic \u2013 absolute negativity \u2013 pour in.  It is true Hegel ''writes'' as if the resolution of opposing live forces can be overcome by a mere thought transcendence.  But he has, by bringing oppositions to their most logical extreme, opened new paths, a new relationship of theory to practice, which Marx worked out as a totally new relationship of philosophy to revolution.   Today's revolutionaries turn their backs on this at their peril." \u2013from ''Philosophy and Revolution''{{page needed|date=February 2015}}\u000a* "It is true that other post-Marx Marxists have rested on a truncated Marxism; it is equally true that no other generation could have seen the problematic of our age, much less solve our problems.  Only live human beings can recreate the revolutionary dialectic forever anew.  And these live human beings must do so in theory as well as in practice.  It is not a question only of meeting the challenge from practice, but of being able to meet the challenge from the self-development of the Idea, and of deepening theory to the point where it reaches Marx's concept of the philosophy of 'revolution in permanence.'" \u2013from ''Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution''{{page needed|date=February 2015}}\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a\u000a===Books===\u000a* Trilogy of Revolution\u000a** ''[[Marxism and Freedom: From 1776 Until Today]]''.
