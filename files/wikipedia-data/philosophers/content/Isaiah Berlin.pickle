In 1921 his family came to England, and he was\u000aeducated at St Paul's School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. <ref name = conccat/> In 1932, at the age of 23, Berlin was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He translated works by [[Ivan Turgenev]] from Russian into English and, during the war, worked for the [[British Diplomatic Service]]. From 1957 to 1967 he was [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]] at the University of Oxford. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1963 to 1964. In 1966, he played a crucial role in founding [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], and became its first President. Berlin was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1946, [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1957, and appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1971. He was President of the [[British Academy]] from 1974 to 1978. He also received the 1979 [[Jerusalem Prize]] for his writings on individual freedom. \u000a\u000aAn annual Isaiah Berlin Lecture is held at the Hampstead Synagogue, at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], at the British Academy, and in Riga. Berlin's work on [[Contributions to liberal theory#Isaiah Berlin|liberal theory]] and on [[value pluralism]] has had a lasting influence.\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000a[[File:Alberta iela 2a02.JPG|thumb|left|Plaque marking what was once Berlin's childhood home in Riga, engraved in Latvian, English and Hebrew with the tribute "The British philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin lived in this house 1909\u20131915"]]\u000aBerlin was the only surviving child of a prosperous Jewish family, the son of Mendel Berlin, a timber trader and direct descendant of [[Shneur Zalman]] (founder of [[Chabad Hasidism]]), and his wife Marie, ''née'' Volshonok. He spent his first six years in [[Riga]], and later lived in Andreapol´ (a small timber town near [[Pskov]], effectively owned by the family business)<ref name=ignatieff21/> and [[Petrograd]] (now Saint Petersburg), witnessing both the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s of 1917.\u000a\u000aFeeling increasingly oppressed by life under [[Bolshevik]] rule, the family left Petrograd, on 5 October 1920, for Riga, but encounters with anti-Semitism and difficulties with the Latvian authorities convinced them to leave, and they moved to Britain in early 1921 (Mendel in January, Isaiah and Marie at the beginning of February), when Berlin was eleven.<ref name=ignatieff31/> In London, the family first stayed in [[Surbiton]], then within the year they bought a house in [[Holland Park]], and six years later in [[Hampstead]]. Berlin's English was virtually nonexistent at first, but he became fluent within a year.<ref name=ignatieff33 />\u000a\u000aBerlin was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)]], then at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he studied Greats ([[Classics]]). In his final examinations, he took a First, winning ''The John Locke Prize'' for his performance in the philosophy papers, in which he outscored [[A. J. Ayer]].<ref name=ignatieff57/> He subsequently took another degree at Oxford in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] ([[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]), winning another First after less than a year on the course. He was appointed a tutor in philosophy at [[New College, Oxford]], and soon afterwards was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], the first Jew to achieve this.\u000a\u000aWhile still a student, he befriended Ayer (with whom he was to share a lifelong amicable rivalry), [[Stuart Hampshire]], [[Richard Wollheim]], [[Maurice Bowra]], [[Stephen Spender]], [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Nicolas Nabokov]]. In 1940, he presented a philosophical paper on other minds to a meeting attended by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] at Cambridge University. Wittgenstein rejected the argument of his paper in discussion but praised Berlin for his intellectual honesty and integrity. Berlin was to remain at Oxford for the rest of his life, apart from a period working for British Information Services in New York from 1940 to 1942, and for the British embassies in Washington, DC, and Moscow from then until 1946. Prior to this service, however, Berlin was barred from participation in the British war effort as a result of his being born in Latvia,<ref>http://contemporarythinkers.org/isaiah-berlin/biography/</ref> and because his left arm had been damaged at birth. In April 1943 he wrote a confidential analysis of members of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] for the [[Foreign Office]]; he described Senator [[Arthur Capper]] from Kansas as ''a solid, stolid, 78-year-old reactionary from the corn belt, who is the very voice of Mid-Western "grass root" isolationism''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 |author=Hachey, Thomas E. |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973\u20131974 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013153 |jstor=4634869 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}</ref>\u000aFor his services, he was appointed a CBE in the [[1946 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37407/pages/53 | title = London Gazette | date = 1 January 1946}}.</ref> Berlin was fluent in Russian and English, spoke French, German and Italian, and knew Hebrew, Latin and Ancient Greek. Meetings with [[Anna Akhmatova]] in [[Leningrad]] in November 1945 and January 1946 had a powerful effect on both of them, and serious repercussions for Akhmatova (who immortalised the meetings in her poetry).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/opinion/brooks-love-story.html | first = David | last = Brooks | title = Love Story | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2 May 2014}}.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1956 he married Aline Halban, ''née'' de Gunzbourg, who was not only the former wife of an Oxford colleague and a former winner of the ladies' golf championship of France, but  from an exiled half Russian-aristocratic and half ennobled-Jewish banking and petroleum family (her mother was Yvonne Deutsch de la Meurthe, granddaughter of [[Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe]]) based in Paris.\u000a[[File:Wolfson College Oxford Berlin Quad.jpg|thumb|300px|The Berlin Quadrangle, [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]].]]\u000a\u000aHe was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1959.<ref name=aaas/> He was instrumental in the founding, in 1966, of a new graduate college at Oxford University: [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]]. The college was founded to be a centre of academic excellence which, unlike many other colleges at Oxford, would also be based on a strong egalitarian and democratic ethos.<ref name=ignatieff268/> Berlin was a member of the Founding Council of the [[Rothermere American Institute]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Founding Council |url=http://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/about/history/foundingcouncil|publisher= The Rothermere American Institute| accessdate = 2012-11-22}}</ref> As later revealed, when he was asked to evaluate the academic credentials of [[Isaac Deutscher]], Isaiah Berlin argued against such a promotion, because of the profoundly pro-communist militancy of the candidate.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Building: Letters 1960\u20131975'', ed. Henry Hardy and Mark Pottle (London: Chatto and Windus, 2013), 377\u20138.</ref>\u000a\u000aBerlin died in Oxford in 1997, aged 88.<ref name = bbcobit /> He is buried there in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]]. On his death, the obituarist of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote: "he was a man of formidable intellectual power with a rare gift for understanding a wide range of human motives, hopes and fears, and a prodigiously energetic capacity for enjoyment \u2013 of life, of people in all their variety, of their ideas and idiosyncrasies, of literature, of music, of art".<ref name = independentobit /> The front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' concluded: "His was an exuberant life crowded with joys \u2013 the joy of thought, the joy of music, the joy of good friends. [...] The theme that runs throughout his work is his concern with liberty and the dignity of human beings [...]. Sir Isaiah radiated well-being."<ref name=nytobit />\u000a\u000a==Thought==\u000a{{Liberalism sidebar}}\u000a\u000a==="Two Concepts of Liberty"===\u000a{{main article|Two Concepts of Liberty}}\u000aBerlin is popularly known for his essay "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]", delivered in 1958 as his inaugural lecture as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, re-introduced the methods of [[analytic philosophy]] to the study of political philosophy. Spurred by his background in the philosophy of language, Berlin argued for a nuanced and subtle understanding of our political terminology, where what was superficially understood as a single concept could mask a plurality of different uses and therefore meanings. Berlin argued that these multiple and differing concepts, otherwise masked by rhetorical conflations, showed the plurality and incompatibility of human values, and the need for us to distinguish and trade off analytically between, rather than conflate, them, if we are to avoid disguising underlying value-conflicts. The two concepts are 'negative freedom', or freedom from interference, which Berlin derived from the British tradition, and 'positive freedom', or freedom as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do. Berlin points out that these two different conceptions of liberty can clash with each other.\u000a\u000a=== Counter-Enlightenment ===\u000a{{main article|Counter-Enlightenment}}\u000a{{further information|Three Critics of the Enlightenment}}\u000aBerlin's writings on [[the Enlightenment]] and its critics (especially [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Johann Georg Hamann]], to whose views Berlin referred as [[the Counter-Enlightenment]]) contributed to his advocacy of an irreducibly pluralist ethical [[ontology]].<ref name=sep/> In ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment'', Berlin argues that Hamann was one of the first thinkers to conceive of human [[cognition]] as [[language]] \u2013 the articulation and use of symbols. Berlin saw Hamann as having recognised as the rationalist's [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] fallacy the notion that there are "clear and distinct" ideas "which can be contemplated by a kind of inner eye", without the use of language \u2013 a recognition greatly sharpened in the 20th century by Wittgenstein's [[private language argument]].<ref name=bleich/>\u000a\u000a=== Value pluralism ===\u000a{{main article|value pluralism}}\u000aFor Berlin, values are creations of mankind, rather than products of nature waiting to be discovered. He argued, on the basis of the epistemic and empathetic access we have to other cultures across history, that the nature of mankind is such that certain values \u2013 the importance of individual liberty, for instance \u2013 will hold true across cultures, and this is what he meant by objective pluralism. Berlin's argument was partly grounded in [[Wittgenstein]]'s later theory of language, which argued that inter-translatability was [[supervenient]] on a similarity in forms of life, with the inverse implication that our epistemic access to other cultures entails an ontologically contiguous value-structure. With his account of value pluralism, he proposed the view that moral values may be equally, or rather incommensurably, valid and yet incompatible, and may therefore come into conflict with one another in a way that admits of no resolution without reference to particular contexts of decision. When values clash, it may not be that one is more important than the other: keeping a promise may conflict with the pursuit of truth; liberty may clash with [[social justice]]. Moral conflicts are "an intrinsic, irremovable element in human life". "These collisions of values are of the essence of what they are and what we are."<ref name=theproperstudyofmankind/> For Berlin, this clashing of incommensurate values within, no less than between, individuals, constitutes the tragedy of human life. Alan Brown suggests, however, that Berlin ignores the fact that values are commensurable in the extent to which they contribute to the human good.<ref name=modernpolitical/>\u000a\u000a==="The Hedgehog and the Fox"===\u000a{{main article|The Hedgehog and the Fox}}\u000a"The Hedgehog and the Fox", a title referring to a fragment of the ancient Greek poet [[Archilochus]], was one of Berlin's most popular essays with the general public, reprinted in numerous editions. Of the classification that gives the essay its title, Berlin once said "I never meant it very seriously. I meant it as a kind of enjoyable intellectual game, but it was taken seriously."<ref name=conversations/>\u000a\u000a===Other work===\u000aBerlin's essay "Historical Inevitability" (1954) focused on a controversy in the [[philosophy of history]]. Given the choice, whether one believes that "the lives of entire peoples and societies have been decisively influenced by exceptional individuals" or, conversely, that whatever happens occurs as a result of impersonal forces oblivious to human intentions, Berlin rejected both options and the choice itself as nonsensical. Berlin is also well known for his writings on Russian intellectual history, most of which are collected in ''Russian Thinkers'' (1978; 2nd ed. 2008) and edited, as most of Berlin's work, by [[Henry Hardy]] (in the case of this volume, jointly with Aileen Kelly). Berlin also contributed a number of essays on leading intellectuals and political figures of his time, including [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Eighteen of these character sketches were published together as "Personal Impressions" (1980; 2nd ed., with four additional essays, 1998; 3rd ed., with a further ten essays, 2014).<ref name=pi3/>\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000aApart from earlier editions of ''Karl Marx'' and ''The Hedgehog and the Fox'', and ''Unfinished Dialogue'', all books listed from 1978 onwards are edited (or, where stated, co-edited) by Henry Hardy, and all but ''Karl Marx'' are compilations or transcripts of lectures, essays, and letters.
