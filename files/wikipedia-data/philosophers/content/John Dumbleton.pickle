V'''John of Dumbleton''' ([[Latin]] ''Ioannes De Dumbleton''; c. 1310&nbsp;\u2013 c. 1349) was a member of the Dumbleton village community in [[Gloucestershire]], a southwestern county in England. Although obscure, he is considered a significant English fourteenth-century philosopher for his contributions to [[logic]], [[natural philosophy]], and [[physics]]. Dumbleton\u2019s masterwork is his ''Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis'' (Summary of Logic and Natural Philosophy), likely to have been composed just before the time of his death.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aJohn of Dumbleton is recorded to have become a [[fellow]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]] (''ca.'' 1338\u20139) and to have studied with the likes of [[William Heytesbury]], [[Thomas Bradwardine]], and [[Richard Swineshead]]. These four medieval scholastics held a common bond in that their study interests were in a similar field, but the method of study which brought these fellows into the same sphere of learning was of a more esoteric bent than modern university methods. They were interested in mathematics and logical analysis for the purposes of natural philosophy, [[theology]], and an [[a priori (epistemology)|''a priori'']] type of [[mathematical physics]] (not to be confused with modern, [[empirical]], [[experimental physics]]). Thus, the physics postulations and conjectures made by Dumbleton and his Oxford contemporaries were primarily done without any application of physical experimentation. Dumbleton, along with the other three Merton philosophers, received the moniker [[Oxford Calculators|'Calculators']] for their adherence to mathematics and logical disputation when solving philosophical and theological problems.<ref>Robert Pasnau (ed.) and Christina Van Dyke (2nd ed.).

''Medieval Philosophers (Dictionary of Literary Biography'' Vol. 115). (USA/United Kingdom: Gale Research International Limited, 1992)</ref>{{rp|253}} The fact that no [[Extant literature|extant]] copy of Dumbleton's ''Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis'' is complete (nor edited) leads one to wonder if his death (''ca.'' 1349) abruptly terminated the possibility of its completion.\u000a\u000a==Philosophical contributions==\u000aThough there was a considerable reverence for [[Platonism]] in Oxford during the fourteenth century, the rebirth of [[Aristotelianism]] held sway in the higher Parisian learning circuits. Dumbleton, who studied in Paris for a brief time, was not immune to this spell. In fact, his [[compendium]] ''Summa Logica et Philosophiae Naturalis'', has an overview of many principles found in Aristotle's ''Physics''. The ''Summa'' is broken into ten different sections. The ninth section is uncompleted in all extant manuscripts. The tenth section, which, according to Dumbleton, was supposed to examine "[[universals]] and signification," shows no evidence of ever being worked on.<ref name=Hackett92 />{{rp|254}} Although this is the case, the other sections of Dumbleton's ''Summa'' are filled with medieval philosophical gems. A couple emphasized topics to be found in the first section are "certitude and the psychology of logic."<ref name=Hackett92 />{{rp|253}} It includes a medieval examination of [[epistemological]] issues; such as the [[certainty]] of knowledge. A strong Aristotelian appreciation is felt in the remaining sections, since the majority of the work is dedicated to commenting on the first eight chapters of Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', and his treatises ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' & ''[[On the Soul]]''. In those sections of the ''Summa'' will be found discussions and commentary on such topics as: alteration, change (i.e., the measure of motion), properties of natural bodies and their forms (parts II and III); questions dealing with classification (e.g., "whether light belongs to some element";<ref name=Hackett92 />{{rp|253}} motions and changes of bodies/forms (parts IV&nbsp;\u2013 VI); and in the final sections an examination of the [[intellect]] and matters of the soul (parts VII&nbsp;\u2013 IX).<ref name=Hackett92 />{{rp|253\u20134}} It is difficult to assess why Dumbleton's ''Summa'' did not have a significant following, but it may have been because it was never completed or that it was not circulated well enough.\u000a\u000a==Scientific contributions==\u000aThe four [[Oxford Calculators|Merton \u2018Calculators\u2019]] were not only well versed in the current issues of philosophy during the fourteenth century; they actually initiated new groundbreaking scientific postulations. John of Dumbleton was no exception. Because he concurred with many of the positions held by [[William Ockham]] (1288\u20131348)\u2014especially the idea that is commonly referred to as [[Ockham\u2019s razor]], which states that the most simplistic explanations are ideal\u2014he may have learned how to succinctly formulate his scientific conjectures.\u000a\u000aOf Dumbleton\u2019s many scientific theories there is one in particular that is worth mentioning here. By making the assumption that bodies are finite, Dumbleton was able to conjecture that contraction or expansion, as in cases of [[condensation]] or [[rarefaction]], does not eliminate any parts of a body; rather, a \u201c[[denumerable]] number of parts\u201d always exists.<ref>Thomas Glick, Steven J. Livesey, and Faith Wallis (eds.). Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia. (Great Britain: Routledge, 2005) p. 518</ref> Though the idea of [[molecules]] was not theorized at this time, Dumbleton\u2019s speculation helped to tame the view that bodies have infinitely divisible parts.\u000a\u000aDumbleton was one of the first to express [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the [[mean speed theorem]] stating that "the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination, stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the [[Inverse-square law]], which was postponed nearly 250 years until its discovery by [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1604.<ref>John Freely, ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe'' (2012)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Criticism==\u000aIt is difficult to determine what methodology the Oxford 'Calculators' used when they were conjecturing and postulating theorems by way of [[abstraction]] (i.e., without empirical investigation). This criticism is not expressly made toward Dumbleton's conjectures but more broadly aimed at the methodology of the whole group of Mertonian physicists. One suggestion is that they may have been trying to create a mathematical picture of the Aristotelian world-view. If this were true, it would show why empirical investigation was not their ''[[modus operandi]]''. In other words, the Oxford Calculators' works show respect for quantitative reasoning; opposed to ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluations. Regardless of whether they opted against empirical investigation for theological reasons or simply because the debut of the [[scientific method]] was not ready to be revealed, one ought to regard John of Dumbleton and his contemporaries as exemplary pioneers in mathematics, physics, and logical discourse.\u000a\u000a==Writings==\u000a* ''Summa Logica et Philosophiae Naturalis'' (c. 1349; There are at least twenty extant manuscripts)\u000a* ''Compendium Sex Conclusionum''\u000a* ''Expositio Capituli Quarti Bradwardini de Proportionibus'' (1332; Exposition of the Fourth Chapter of Bradwardine's ''De Proportionibus'')\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[Medieval European scientists]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a\u000a* Norman Kretxmann, Anthony Kenny, and Jan Pinborg (eds.).
