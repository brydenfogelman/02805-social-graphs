His view is thus a variety of invariantism. However, whether a subject has knowledge depends to a surprising extent on features of the ''subject's'' context, including practical concerns. This position can be classed as a form of [[pragmatism]]. The American philosopher [[Jason Stanley]] holds a similar view.\u000a\u000aHawthorne has also written on philosophy of language and philosophical logic, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, and on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].\u000a\u000a==Education==\u000aHawthorne earned his Ph.D. from [[Syracuse University]], where he studied with [[William Alston]] and [[Jonathan F.
