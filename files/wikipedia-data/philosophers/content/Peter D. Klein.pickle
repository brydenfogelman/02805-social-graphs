Klein at [[Rutgers University]]]]-->\u000a'''Peter David Klein''' (born September 17, 1940) is a [[philosopher]] specializing in issues in epistemology. Peter Klein received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at [[Earlham College]] (1962), and an MA (1964) and [[PhD]] from [[Yale University]] (1966).\u000a\u000aHe taught at Colgate University as an assistant professor from 1966-1970. Following that, he moved to Rutgers University, where he taught as an assistant professor from 1970-1973, an associate professor from 1973-1981, and a full professor from 1981 until leaving Rutgers in 2016.\u000a\u000aKlein is widely known for his work on skepticism.  His most influential work, however, is on the nature of knowledge, where he has long defended the defeasibility theory.  His recent work defends [[infinitism]] about [[theory of justification|justification]].  On this view, to be justified in believing P is to possess a reason R1 to believe P, and a reason R2 to believe R1, and a reason R3.....and so on, ad infinitum.  Justification is, so to speak, "[[turtles all the way down]]."  He has also recently advocated a picture of knowledge according to which one can have knowledge of p even if the justification for the belief that p is essentially based on false premises.  Klein calls these "useful falsehoods".\u000a\u000aKlein authored one book: ''Certainty: A Refutation of Skepticism'' (1982) (University of Minnesota Press), and co-edited ''Ad Infinitum: New Essays on Epistemological Infinitism'' (Oxford University Press) with John Turri. He has published a number of articles, chapters, and reviews in [[epistemology]].\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[American philosophy]]\u000a* [[List of American philosophers]]\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a* [http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/for-faculty/105-klein-peter Peter Klein's homepage]\u000a* [http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/docman-lister/cv/262-klein-cv/file|Peter Klein's CV]\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Klein, Peter}}\u000a[[Category:American philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:1940 births]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a[[Category:Earlham College alumni]]\u000a\u000a\u000a{{US-philosopher-stub}}
