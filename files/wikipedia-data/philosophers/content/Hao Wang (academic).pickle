He obtained a B.Sc. degree in [[mathematics]] from the [[National Southwestern Associated University]] in 1943 and an M.A. in [[Philosophy]] from [[Tsinghua University]] in 1945, where his teachers included [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Jin Yuelin]], after which he moved to the United States for further graduate studies. He studied logic at [[Harvard University]], culminating in a Ph.D. in 1948. He was appointed to an assistant professorship at Harvard the same year.\u000a\u000aDuring the early 1950s, Wang studied with [[Paul Bernays]] in [[Zurich]]. In 1956, he was appointed Reader in the Philosophy of Mathematics at [[Oxford University]]. In 1959, Wang wrote on an [[IBM 704|IBM704]] computer a program that in only 9 minutes mechanically proved several hundred [[mathematical logic]] theorems in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Wang |first1=Hao |title=Toward Mechanical Mathematics |doi=10.1147/rd.41.0002 |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |year=1960 |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=2\u201322}} [Wang 1960a].</ref> In 1961, he was appointed [[Gordon Mckay]] Professor of Mathematical Logic and Applied Mathematics at Harvard.<ref>http://lewis.seas.harvard.edu/biocv</ref> From 1967 until 1991, he headed the logic research group at [[Rockefeller University]] in [[New York City]], where he was [[professor]] of logic.  In 1972, Wang joined in a group of Chinese American scientists led by [[Chih-Kung Jen]] as the first such delegation from the U.S. to the People's Republic of China.\u000a\u000aOne of Wang's most important contributions was the [[Wang tile]].<ref>[Wang 1960a].</ref>  He showed that any [[Turing machine]] can be turned into a set of Wang tiles.  The first noted example of [[aperiodic tiling]] is a set of Wang tiles, whose nonexistence Wang had once conjectured, discovered by his student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] in 1966. A philosopher in his own right,<ref>[Wang 1974 and 1985a]</ref> Wang also developed a penetrating interpretation of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy of mathematics, which he called "anthropologism."  He chronicled [[Kurt Gödel]]'s philosophical ideas and authored several books on the subject,<ref>[Wang 1996a, 1987a, and in 1974a].</ref> thereby providing contemporary scholars an inestimable resource for Gödel's later philosophical thought.\u000a\u000aIn 1983 he was presented with the first Milestone Prize for [[Automated theorem proving|Automated Theorem-Proving]], sponsored by the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Loveland, Donald W. |author2=Bledsoe, W.
