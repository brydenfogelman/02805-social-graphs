Friedrich's father, from whom he received his middle name, was also born in Vienna in 1871. He was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health, with passion in botany, in which he wrote a number of monographs. August von Hayek was also a part-time botany lecturer at the [[University of Vienna]]. Friedrich's mother was born in 1875 to a wealthy, conservative, land-owning family. As her mother died several years prior to Friedrich's birth, Felicitas gained a significant inheritance which provided as much as half of her and August's income during the early years of their marriage. Hayek was the oldest of three brothers, [[Heinrich von Hayek|Heinrich]] (1900\u201369) and [[Erich von Hayek|Erich]] (1904\u201386), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than him.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=7}}\u000a\u000aHis father's career as a university professor influenced Friedrich's goals later in life.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=7\u20138}} Both of his grandfathers, who lived long enough for Friedrich to know them, were scholars. [[Franz von Juraschek]] was a leading economist in [[Austria-Hungary]] and a close friend of [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]], one of the founders of the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]]. Von Juraschek was a statistician and was later employed by the Austrian government. Friedrich's paternal grandfather, [[Gustav Edler von Hayek]], taught natural sciences at the Imperial ''Realobergymnasium'' (secondary school) in Vienna. He wrote systematic works in biology, some of which are relatively well known.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=8}}\u000a\u000aOn his mother's side, Hayek was second cousin to the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. His mother often played with Wittgenstein's sisters, and had known Ludwig well. As a result of their family relationship, Hayek became one of the first to read Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' when the book was published in its original German edition in 1921. Although Hayek met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought.<ref>Ebenstein, p. 245</ref> In his later years, Hayek recalled a discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein, when both were officers during World War I.<ref>''Hayek on Hayek: an autobiographical dialogue'', By Friedrich August Hayek, Routledge, 1994, p. 51</ref> After Wittgenstein's death, Hayek had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on collecting family materials; and he later assisted biographers of Wittgenstein.<ref>''Young Ludwig: Wittgenstein's life'', 1889\u20131921, Brian McGuinness, Oxford University Press, 2005 p. xii</ref>\u000a\u000aHayek displayed an intellectual and academic bent from a very young age.

For a short time, when the University of Vienna closed, Hayek studied in [[Constantin von Monakow]]'s Institute of Brain Anatomy, where Hayek spent much of his time [[staining]] brain cells. Hayek's time in Monakow's lab, and his deep interest in the work of [[Ernst Mach]], inspired Hayek's first intellectual project, eventually published as ''The Sensory Order'' (1952). It located connective learning at the physical and neurological levels, rejecting the "sense data" associationism of the [[empiricists]] and [[logical positivism|logical positivists]].<ref name="Backhaus2005,Arena2012">\u000aThe Sensory Order (1952) on learning\u000a* {{Cite book| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| isbn = 978-1845427955| last = Backhaus| first = Jurgen G.| title = Entrepreneurship, Money and Coordination: Hayek's Theory of Cultural Evolution| date = 2005-01-01}}{{rp|48}}\u000a* {{Cite book| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| isbn = 978-1781001028| others = Richard Arena, Agnès Festré, Nathalie Lazaric (eds.)| title = Handbook of Knowledge and Economics| date = 2012-01-01}}{{rp|133}}\u000a</ref> Hayek presented his work to the private seminar he had created with [[Herbert Furth]] called [[the Geistkreis]].<ref>[https://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae6_2_2.pdf "The Viennese Connection: Alfred Schutz and the Austrian School" by Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard.]</ref>\u000a\u000aDuring Hayek's years at the University of Vienna, [[Carl Menger]]'s work on the explanatory strategy of social science and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]'s commanding presence in the classroom left a lasting influence on him.<ref name=UCLA/> Upon the completion of his examinations, Hayek was hired by [[Ludwig von Mises]] on the recommendation of Wieser as a specialist for the Austrian government working on the legal and economic details of the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]]. Between 1923 and 1924 Hayek worked as a research assistant to Prof. [[Jeremiah Jenks]] of [[New York University]], compiling macroeconomic data on the American economy and the operations of the US Federal Reserve.<ref>A.

It was sometime after reading ''Socialism'' that Hayek began attending von Mises' private seminars, joining several of his university friends, including [[Fritz Machlup]], Alfred Schutz, Felix Kaufmann, and Gottfried Haberler, who were also participating in Hayek's own, more general, private seminar. It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]], with whom he retained a long-standing relationship.<ref>Federici, Michael.

Upon his arrival in London, Hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world, and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of [[John Hicks]], [[Abba Lerner]], and many others in the development of modern microeconomics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baxendale |first=Toby |url=http://www.cobdencentre.org/2010/07/the-battle-of-the-letters/ |title=The Battle of the Letters: Keynes v Hayek 1932, Skidelsky v Besley 2010 |publisher=The Cobden Centre |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1932, Hayek suggested that private investment in the public markets was a better road to wealth and economic co-ordination in Britain than government spending programs, as argued in a letter he co-signed with Lionel Robbins and others in an exchange of letters with [[John Maynard Keynes]] in ''[[The Times]].''<ref>http://thinkmarkets.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/keynes-hayek-1932-cambridgelse.pdf</ref><ref>Malcolm Perrine McNair, Richard Stockton Meriam, ''Problems in business economics'', McGraw-Hill, 1941, p. 504</ref> The nearly decade long deflationary depression in Britain dating from Churchill's decision in 1925 to return Britain to the gold standard at the old pre-war, pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for Hayek's single public engagement with Keynes over British monetary and fiscal policy, otherwise Hayek and Keynes agreed on many theoretical matters, and their economic disagreements were fundamentally theoretical, having to do almost exclusively with the relation of the economics of extending the length of production to the economics of labour inputs.\u000a\u000aEconomists who studied with Hayek at the LSE in the 1930s and the 1940s include [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]], [[Ronald Coase]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], Abba Lerner, [[Nicholas Kaldor]], [[George Shackle]], [[Thomas Balogh]], [[Vera Smith (economist)|Vera Smith]], [[L.

Hayek's salary was funded not by the university, but by an outside foundation. University of Chicago President Robert Hutchins was in the midst of a war with the U. of Chicago faculty over departmental autonomy and control, and Hayek got caught in the middle of that battle. Hutchins had been attempting to force all departments to adopt the neo-Thomist Great Books program of Mortimer Adler, and the U. of Chicago economists were sick of Hutchins' meddling.

Hayek claimed that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because "its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise".\u000a\u000aHayek stated that if the Conservative leader had said "that free choice is to be exercised more in the market place than in the ballot box, she has merely uttered the truism that the first is indispensable for individual freedom while the second is not: free choice can at least exist under a dictatorship that can limit itself but not under the government of an unlimited democracy which cannot".<ref>"Letters to the Editor: The dangers to personal liberty", ''The Times'' (11 July 1978), p. 15.</ref>\u000a\u000a=== Influence on central European politics ===\u000a\u000aUS President [[Ronald Reagan]] listed Hayek as among the two or three people who most influenced his philosophy and welcomed Hayek to the White House as a special guest.<ref>Martin Anderson, "Revolution" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1988), p. 164</ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, the writings of Hayek were also a major influence on many of the leaders of the "velvet" revolution in Central Europe during the collapse of the old [[Soviet Empire]].

[[Mises]] had earlier applied the concept of [[marginal utility]] to the value of money in his ''[[Theory of Money and Credit]]'' (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for "industrial fluctuations" based on the ideas of the old [[British Currency School]] and of Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]]. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the "[[Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle]]". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as ''Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle''. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his ''Prices and Production'' (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the [[central bank]]'s inflationary [[Credit cycle|credit expansion]] and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low [[interest rate]]s. Hayek claimed that "the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process".\u000a\u000aHayek's analysis was based on [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk|Böhm-Bawerk]]'s concept of the "average period of production"<ref>See the chapter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fkVHIn8y8qkC&pg=PA7 "The collaboration with Keynes and the controversy with Hayek,"], Heinz D.

Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centred at the [[University of Cambridge]] and deriving largely from the work of [[Alfred Marshall]]), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931.

This argument, first proposed by [[Max Weber]], says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the [[price]] mechanism in free markets (see [[economic calculation problem]]).\u000a\u000aIn 1935, Hayek published ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', a collection of essays from an earlier debate that had been initiated by Ludwig von Mises.  Hayek included Mises's essay, in which Mises argued that rational planning was impossible under socialism.\u000a\u000aSome socialists such as [[H. D. Dickinson]] and [[Oskar Lange]], responded by invoking [[general equilibrium theory]], which they argued disproved Mises's thesis.  They noted that the difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations.  They argued, if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling them to adjust the prices up or down, just as in a free market. Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system, while avoiding its many problems.\u000a\u000aHayek challenged this vision in a series of contributions.  In "Economics and Knowledge" (1937), he pointed out that the standard equilibrium theory assumed that all agents have full and correct information.  In  the real world, however, different individuals have different bits of knowledge, and furthermore, some of what they believe is wrong.\u000a\u000aIn ''[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]'' (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve diverse, complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous [[self-organization]]. He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place.<ref>Hein Schreuder, "Coase, Hayek and Hierarchy", In: S.

Hayek argued that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind. In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the [[rule of law]], with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book, ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards [[totalitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|title=Economics: The User's Guide|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|location=London|isbn=978-0-718-19703-2|language=English|chapter=4}}</ref>\u000a\u000aFrom ''The Road to Serfdom:''\u000a\u000a{{quote|Although our modern socialists' promise of greater freedom is genuine and sincere, in recent years observer after observer has been impressed by the unforeseen consequences of socialism, the extraordinary similarity in many respects of the conditions under "communism" and "fascism".<ref name="ReferenceA">Hayek, FA.

Hayek's work on the macroeconomic subjects of [[central planning]], trade cycle theory, the division of knowledge, and entrepreneurial adaptation especially, differ greatly from the opinions of macroeconomic "Marshallian" economists in the tradition of John Maynard Keynes and the microeconomic "[[Léon Walras|Walrasian]]" economists in the tradition of Abba Lerner.\u000a\u000a=== Philosophy of science ===\u000a{{see also|The Counter-Revolution of Science}}\u000aDuring World War II, Hayek began the \u2018Abuse of Reason\u2019 project.

"Hayek, Friedrich August von (1899\u20131992)." The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Second Edition. Eds. Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008.</ref> In his [[philosophy of science]], which has much in common with that of his good friend [[Karl Popper]], Hayek was highly critical of what he termed ''[[scientism]]'': a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science. Usually, scientism involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships.\u000a\u000aHayek points out that much of science involves the explanation of complex multivariable and nonlinear phenomena, and the social science of economics and undesigned order compares favourably with such complex sciences as Darwinian biology. These ideas were developed in [[The Counter-Revolution of Science]] in 1952, and in some of Hayek's later essays in the philosophy of science such as ''Degrees of Explanation'' and ''The Theory of Complex Phenomena''.\u000a\u000aIn ''Counter-Revolution'', for example, Hayek observed that the hard sciences attempt to remove the "human factor" in order to obtain objective, strictly controlled results:\u000a\u000a{{quote |[T]he persistent effort of modern Science has been to get down to "objective facts," to cease studying what men thought about nature or regarding the given concepts as true images of the real world, and, above all, to discard all theories which pretended to explain phenomena by imputing to them a directing mind like our own. Instead, its main task became to revise and reconstruct the concepts formed from ordinary experience on the basis of a systematic testing of the phenomena, so as to be better able to recognize the particular as an instance of a general rule.|Friedrich A.

Hayek thought that the sensory order is in fact a product of the brain.  He characterized the brain as a highly complex but self-ordering, hierarchical classification system, a huge network of connections.\u000a\u000a=== Social and political philosophy ===\u000a\u000aIn the latter half of his career Hayek made a number of contributions to [[social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]], which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge,<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society \u2013 A selected essay reprint |publisher=Econlib.org |date= |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> and the idea of ''spontaneous order'' in social institutions.  He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function.  These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from [[epistemological]] concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge.  Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.<ref>''Individualism and Economic Order'', p. 11</ref>\u000a\u000aHayek disapproved of the notion of '[[social justice]]'.  He compared the market to a game in which 'there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust'<ref>''The Mirage of Social Justice'', chap. 10</ref> and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content';<ref name=hayek1948ch12>''The Mirage of Social Justice'', chap. 12</ref> likewise "the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning".<ref>''The Constitution of Liberty'', chap. 6</ref> He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: "the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society."<ref name=hayek1948ch12 />\u000a\u000a==== Spontaneous order ====\u000a{{Main article|Spontaneous order}}\u000a\u000aHayek viewed the [[free price system]] not as a conscious invention (that which is intentionally designed by man), but as spontaneous order or what he referred to as "that which is the result of human action but not of human design". Thus, Hayek put the ''price mechanism'' on the same level as, for example, language.\u000a\u000aHayek attributed the birth of civilisation to [[private property]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]'' (1988). He explained that [[price signals]] are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate [[tacit knowledge]] or [[dispersed knowledge]] to each other, to solve the economic calculation problem.\u000a\u000a[[Alain de Benoist]] of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' (New Right) produced a highly critical essay on Hayek's work in an issue of ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'', citing the flawed assumptions behind Hayek's idea of "[[spontaneous order]]" and the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], totalising implications of his [[Free market|free-market]] ideology.<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Benoist |first=Alain |authorlink=Alain de Benoist |title=Hayek: A Critique |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |year=1998 |issue=110}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==== The ecosystem as a spontaneous order ====\u000aHayek\u2019s concept of the market as a spontaneous order has been recently applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|url = http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey}}</ref> Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|url = http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 2\u201311}}</ref> On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements.

Diamond argued that: \u201cThe human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited in its ability to synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market.

But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism.  My personal impression \u2013 and this is valid for South America \u2013 is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government."  In a letter to the ''[[London Times]]'', he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had "not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]."<ref>Greg Grandin, professor of history, New York University, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t5itdZ7oycUC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=greg+grandin+hayek&source=bl&ots=yJzrb3YduJ&sig=GonAv6w1wQiM5vdwBknys97PZEY&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism]'', pp. 172\u201373, Metropolitan, 2006, ISBN 0805077383.</ref><ref>Dan Avnôn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6TmN-9qAmQC ''Liberalism and its Practice]'', p. 56, Routledge, 1999, ISBN 0415193540.</ref> Hayek admitted that "it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is.", he explained, however, "It is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust.  But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this.  And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy".\u000a\u000aFor Hayek, the supposedly stark difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and Hayek places heavy weight on this distinction in his defence of transitional dictatorship.  For example, when Hayek visited Venezuela in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America.  In reply, Hayek warned against confusing "totalitarianism with authoritarianism," and said that he was unaware of "any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende".  For Hayek, however, the word 'totalitarian' signifies something very specific: the want to \u201corganize the whole of society\u201d to attain a \u201cdefinite social goal\u201d \u2014which is stark in contrast to \u201cliberalism and individualism\u201d.<ref>[http://coreyrobin.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hayekchile.pdf Preventing the "Abuses" of Democracy: Hayek, the "Military Usurper" and Transitional Dictatorship in Chile?], [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]</ref>\u000a\u000a== Influence and recognition ==\u000aHayek's influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged.

The "informal" economics presented in Milton Friedman's massively influential popular work ''[[Free to Choose]]'' (1980), is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945) in his graduate seminars.\u000a\u000aIn 1944 he was elected as a Fellow of the [[British Academy]],<ref>Fritz Machlup, ''Essays on Hayek'', Routledge, 2003. p. 14.</ref> after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.<ref>Sylvia Nasar, ''Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius'', Simon and Schuster, 2011, p. 402</ref>\u000a\u000aHarvard economist and former Harvard University President [[Lawrence Summers]] explains Hayek's place in modern economics: "What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today?

New York: Simon & Schuster. 1998, pp. 150\u201351.</ref>\u000a\u000aBy 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], a group of classical liberals who sought to oppose what they saw as socialism in various areas. He was also instrumental in the founding of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the free-market think tank that inspired [[Thatcherism]]. He was in addition a member of the [[Philadelphia Society]].<ref>http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf</ref>\u000a\u000aHayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, "I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]." (See Hacohen, 2000). Popper dedicated his ''Conjectures and Refutations'' to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, ''Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics'', to Popper and, in 1982, said that "ever since his ''Logik der Forschung'' first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology".<ref>See Weimer and Palermo, 1982</ref> Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration, however, do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.<ref>See Birner, 2001, and for the mutual influence they had on each other's ideas on evolution, Birner 2009</ref>\u000a\u000aHayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote:\u000a:"My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it...."<ref>Milton & Rose Friedman, ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs'' (U. of Chicago Press), 1998. p. 333</ref>\u000a\u000aHayek's greatest intellectual debt was to [[Carl Menger]], who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by [[Bernard Mandeville]] and the Scottish moral philosophers in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in ''The Road to Serfdom'' (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of [[postmodernism]].<ref>e.g., Wolin 2004</ref>\u000a\u000a=== Hayek and conservatism ===\u000a\u000aHayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. After winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979]], Margaret Thatcher appointed [[Keith Joseph]], the director of the Hayekian [[Centre for Policy Studies]], as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament's economic strategies. Likewise, [[David Stockman]], Ronald Reagan's most influential financial official in 1981 was an acknowledged follower of Hayek.<ref>Kenneth R. Hoover, ''Economics as Ideology: Keynes, Laski, Hayek, and the Creation of Contemporary Politics'' (2003), p. 213</ref>\u000a\u000aHayek wrote an essay, "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (included as an appendix to ''The Constitution of Liberty''), in which he disparaged conservatism for its inability to adapt to changing human realities or to offer a positive political program, remarking, "Conservatism is only as good as what it conserves." Although he noted that modern day conservatism shares many opinions on economics with classical liberals, particularly a belief in the free market, he believed it's because conservatism wants to "stand still," whereas [[classical liberalism|liberalism]] embraces the free market because it "wants to go somewhere." Hayek identified himself as a classical liberal, but noted that in the United States it had become almost impossible to use "liberal" in its original definition, and the term "[[libertarianism|libertarian]]" has been used instead. In this text, Hayek also opposed [[conservatism]] for "its hostility to [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and its proneness to a strident [[nationalism]]" and its frequent association with [[imperialism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why I Am Not a Conservative |publisher=LewRockwell.com |date= |accessdate=12 October 2011 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dieteman/dieteman31.html}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHowever, for his part, Hayek found this term "singularly unattractive" and offered the term "Old [[British Whig Party|Whig]]" (a phrase borrowed from [[Edmund Burke]]) instead. In his later life, he said, "I am becoming a Burkean Whig." However, Whiggery as a political doctrine had little affinity for classical political economy, the tabernacle of the Manchester School and William Gladstone.<ref>E. H. H. Green, ''Ideologies of Conservatism. Conservative Political Ideas in the Twentieth Century'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 259.</ref> His essay has served as an inspiration to other liberal-minded economists wishing to distinguish themselves from conservative thinkers, for example [[James M. Buchanan]]'s essay "Why I, Too, Am Not a Conservative: The Normative Vision of Classical Liberalism".\u000a\u000aHis opponents have attacked Hayek as a leading promoter of "[[neoliberalism]]". A British scholar, [[Samuel Brittan]], concluded in 2010, "Hayek's book [''The Constitution of Liberty''] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals."<ref name="brittan">Samuel Brittan, "The many faces of liberalism," [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/529c55fe-06df-11df-b058-00144feabdc0.html ft.com], 22 January 2010</ref> Brittan adds that although [[Raymond Plant, Baron Plant of Highfield|Raymond Plant]] (2009) comes out in the end against Hayek's doctrines, Plant gives ''The Constitution of Liberty'' a "more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents".<ref name="brittan" />\u000a\u000aIn ''Why F A Hayek is a Conservative'',<ref>"Why F A Hayek is a Conservative" Eamonn Butler and Madsen Pirie (eds) ''Hayek on the Fabric of Human Society'' (Adam Smith Institute, 1987)</ref> British policy analyst [[Madsen Pirie]] claims Hayek mistakes the nature of the conservative outlook. Conservatives, he says, are not averse to change \u2013 but like Hayek, they are highly averse to change being imposed on the social order by people in authority who think they know how to run things better. They wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop. It is an outlook, says Pirie, that Hayek and conservatives both share.\u000a\u000a=== Hayek\u2019s influence on contemporary macroeconomic policy discussions ===\u000a\u000aHayek\u2019s ideas on spontaneous order and the importance of prices in dealing with the knowledge problem has inspired a debate on economic development and transition economies after the fall of the Berlin wall.

Ronald McKinnon <ref>McKinnon, Spontaneous Order on the Road Back from Socialism: An Asian Perspective. American Economic Review (1992): http://www.jstor.org/stable/2117371</ref> uses Hayekian ideas to describe challenges of transition from a centralized state and planned economy to a market economy. Former World Bank Chief Economist William Easterly emphasizes why foreign aid tends to have no effect at best in bestsellers such as White Man\u2019s Burden.<ref>W.
