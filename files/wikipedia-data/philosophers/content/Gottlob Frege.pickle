Considered a major figure in mathematics, he is responsible for the development of modern logic and making contributions to the [[foundations of mathematics]]. He is also understood by many to be the father of [[analytic philosophy]], where he concentrated on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858\u20131932) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872\u20131970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000a\u000a===Childhood (1848\u201369)===\u000aFrege was born in 1848 in [[Wismar]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] (today part of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]). His father Carl (Karl) Alexander Frege (1809\u20131866) was the co-founder and headmaster of a girls' high school until his death. After Carl's death, the school was led by Frege's mother Auguste Wilhelmine Sophie Frege (née Bialloblotzky, of [[Poles|Polish]] descent, 12 January 1815 \u2013 14 October 1898).\u000a\u000aIn childhood, Frege encountered philosophies that would guide his future scientific career. For example, his father wrote a [[textbook]] on the German language for children aged 9\u201313, entitled ''Hülfsbuch zum Unterrichte in der deutschen Sprache für Kinder von 9 bis 13 Jahren'' (2nd ed., Wismar 1850; 3rd ed., Wismar and Ludwigslust: Hinstorff, 1862), the first section of which dealt with the structure and [[logic]] of [[language]].\u000a\u000aFrege studied at a [[gymnasium (school)|''gymnasium'']] in Wismar and graduated in 1869. His teacher Gustav Adolf Leo Sachse (5 November 1843 \u2013 1 September 1909), who was a poet, played the most important role in determining Frege's future scientific career, encouraging him to continue his studies at the [[University of Jena]].\u000a\u000a===Studies at University: Jena and Göttingen (1869\u201374)===\u000aFrege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the [[North German Confederation]]. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was [[Ernst Karl Abbe]] (1840\u20131905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence.\u000a\u000aHis other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806\u201386; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytical geometry of [[plane (geometry)|planes]], analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); [[Hermann Schaeffer|Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer]] (1824\u20131900; analytical geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other [[electronics|electronic machines]]); and the philosopher [[Kuno Fischer]] (1824\u20131907; Kantian and critical philosophy).\u000a\u000aStarting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in Göttingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of [[Alfred Clebsch|Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch]] (1833\u201372; analytical geometry), [[Ernst Christian Julius Schering]] (1824\u201397; function theory), [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] (1804\u201391; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845\u20131915; theory of electricity), and [[Hermann Lotze]] (1817\u201381; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures.\u000a\u000aIn 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of "Ueber<!--[sic; see 'Talk:Gottlob Frege#Ueber']--> eine geometrische Darstellung der imaginären Gebilde in der Ebene" ("On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane"), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points.\u000a\u000aFrege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 \u2013 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.\u000a\u000a==Work as a logician==\u000a{{Main|Begriffsschrift}}\u000aThough his education and early mathematical work focused primarily on geometry, Frege's work soon turned to logic. His {{Citation | title = [[Begriffsschrift]], eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens | place = Halle a/S | publisher = Verlag von Louis Nebert | year = 1879 | trans_title = Concept-Script: A Formal Language for Pure Thought Modeled on that of Arithmetic}} marked a turning point in the history of logic. The ''Begriffsschrift'' broke new ground, including a rigorous treatment of the ideas of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s and [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. Frege's goal was to show that mathematics grows out of [[logic]], and in so doing, he devised techniques that took him far beyond the Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic propositional logic that had come down to him in the logical tradition.\u000a\u000a[[File:Begriffsschrift Titel.png|right|thumb|250px|Title page to ''Begriffsschrift'' (1879)]] In effect, Frege invented [[axiomatization|axiomatic]] [[predicate logic]], in large part thanks to his invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variables]], which eventually became ubiquitous in [[mathematics]] and logic, and which solved the [[problem of multiple generality]]. Previous logic had dealt with the [[logical constant]]s ''and'', ''or'', ''if... then...'', ''not'', and ''some'' and ''all'', but iterations of these operations, especially "some" and "all", were little understood: even the distinction between a sentence like "every boy loves some girl" and "some girl is loved by every boy" could be represented only very artificially, whereas Frege's formalism had no difficulty expressing the different readings of "every boy loves some girl who loves some boy who loves some girl" and similar sentences, in complete parallel with his treatment of, say, "every boy is foolish".\u000a\u000aA frequently noted example is that Aristotle's logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like [[Euclid's theorem]], a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of [[prime number]]s. Frege's "conceptual notation" however can represent such inferences.<ref>Horsten, Leon and Pettigrew, Richard, "Introduction" in ''The Continuum Companion to Philosophical Logic'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011), p. 7.</ref>  The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (3 vols., 1910\u201313) (by [[Bertrand Russell]], 1872\u20131970, and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], 1861\u20131947), to Russell's [[theory of descriptions]], to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s (1906\u201378) [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorems]], and to [[Alfred Tarski]]'s (1901\u201383) theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege.\u000a\u000aOne of Frege's stated purposes was to isolate genuinely logical principles of inference, so that in the proper representation of mathematical proof, one would at no point appeal to "intuition". If there was an intuitive element, it was to be isolated and represented separately as an axiom: from there on, the proof was to be purely logical and without gaps. Having exhibited this possibility, Frege's larger purpose was to defend the view that [[arithmetic]] is a branch of logic, a view known as [[logicism]]: unlike geometry, arithmetic was to be shown to have no basis in "intuition", and no need for non-logical axioms. Already in the 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' important preliminary theorems, for example a generalized form of [[law of trichotomy]], were derived within what Frege understood to be pure logic.\u000a\u000aThis idea was formulated in non-symbolic terms in his ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884). Later, in his ''Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' (vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903; vol. 2 was published at his own expense), Frege attempted to derive, by use of his symbolism, all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical. Most of these axioms were carried over from his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', though not without some significant changes. The one truly new principle was one he called the Basic Law V:  the "value-range" of the function ''f''(''x'') is the same as the "value-range" of the function ''g''(''x'') if and only if \u2200''x''[''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'')].\u000a\u000aThe crucial case of the law may be formulated in modern notation as follows. Let {''x''|''Fx''} denote the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of the [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] ''Fx'', i.e., the set of all Fs, and similarly for ''Gx''. Then Basic Law V says that the predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gx'' have the same extension [[iff]] \u2200x[''Fx'' \u2194 ''Gx'']. The set of Fs is the same as the set of Gs just in case every F is a G and every G is an F. (The case is special because what is here being called the extension of a predicate, or a set, is only one type of "value-range" of a function.)\u000a\u000aIn a famous episode, Bertrand Russell wrote to Frege, just as Vol. 2 of the ''Grundgesetze'' was about to go to press in 1903, showing that [[Russell's paradox]] could be derived from Frege's Basic Law V. It is easy to define the relation of ''membership'' of a set or extension in Frege's system; Russell then drew attention to "the set of things ''x'' that are such that ''x'' is not a member of ''x''". The system of the ''Grundgesetze'' entails that the set thus characterised ''both'' is ''and'' is not a member of itself, and is thus inconsistent. Frege wrote a hasty, last-minute Appendix to Vol. 2, deriving the contradiction and proposing to eliminate it by modifying Basic Law V. Frege opened the Appendix with the exceptionally honest comment: "Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion." (This letter and Frege's reply are translated in [[Jean van Heijenoort]] 1967.)\u000a\u000aFrege's proposed remedy was subsequently shown to imply that there is but one object in the [[universe of discourse]], and hence is worthless (indeed, this would make for a contradiction in Frege's system if he had axiomatized the idea, fundamental to his discussion, that the True and the False are distinct objects; see, for example, [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] 1973), but recent work has shown that much of the program of the ''Grundgesetze'' might be salvaged in other ways:\u000a* Basic Law V can be weakened in other ways. The best-known way is due to philosopher and mathematical logician [[George Boolos]] (1940\u20131996), who was an expert on the work of Frege. A "concept" ''F'' is "small" if the objects falling under ''F'' cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the universe of discourse, that is, unless: \u2203''R''[''R'' is 1-to-1 & \u2200''x''\u2203''y''(''xRy'' & ''Fy'')]. Now weaken V to V*: a "concept" ''F'' and a "concept" ''G'' have the same "extension" if and only if neither ''F'' nor ''G'' is small or \u2200''x''(''Fx'' \u2194 ''Gx''). V* is consistent if [[second-order arithmetic]] is, and suffices to prove the axioms of second-order arithmetic.\u000a* Basic Law V can simply be replaced with [[Hume's Principle]], which says that the number of ''F''s is the same as the number of ''G''s if and only if the ''F''s can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the ''G''s. This principle, too, is consistent if second-order arithmetic is, and suffices to prove the axioms of second-order arithmetic. This result is termed [[Frege's Theorem]] because it was noticed that in developing arithmetic, Frege's use of Basic Law V is restricted to a proof of Hume's Principle; it is from this, in turn, that arithmetical principles are derived. On Hume's Principle and Frege's Theorem, see "Frege's Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic".<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-logic/ Frege's Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''] at plato.stanford.edu</ref>\u000a* Frege's logic, now known as [[second-order logic]], can be weakened to so-called [[Impredicativity|predicative]] second-order logic. Predicative second-order logic plus Basic Law V is provably consistent by [[finitism|finitistic]] or [[Mathematical constructivism|constructive]] methods, but it can interpret only very weak fragments of arithmetic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Burgess, John|title=Fixing Frege|year=2005|isbn=0-691-12231-8}}</ref>\u000a\u000aFrege's work in logic had little international attention until 1903 when Russell wrote an appendix to ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' stating his differences with Frege. The diagrammatic notation\u000athat Frege used had no antecedents (and has had no imitators since). Moreover, until Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (3 vols.) appeared in 1910\u201313, the dominant approach to [[mathematical logic]] was still that of [[George Boole]] (1815\u201364) and his intellectual descendants, especially [[Ernst Schröder]] (1841\u20131902). Frege's logical ideas nevertheless spread through the writings of his student [[Rudolf Carnap]] (1891\u20131970) and other admirers, particularly Bertrand Russell and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889\u20131951).\u000a\u000a==Philosopher==\u000aFrege is one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]], mainly because of his contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], including the\u000a* [[Function (mathematics)|Function]]\u2013argument analysis of the [[proposition]];\u000a* Distinction between [[concept and object]] (''Begriff und Gegenstand'');\u000a* Principle of [[compositionality]];\u000a* [[Context principle]];\u000a* Distinction between the [[sense and reference]] (''Sinn und Bedeutung'') of names and other expressions, sometimes said to involve a [[mediated reference theory]].\u000a\u000aAs a philosopher of mathematics, Frege attacked the [[psychologism|psychologistic]] appeal to mental explanations of the content of judgment of the meaning of sentences. His original purpose was very far from answering general questions about meaning; instead, he devised his logic to explore the foundations of arithmetic, undertaking to answer questions such as "What is a number?" or "What objects do number-words ("one", "two", etc.) refer to?" But in pursuing these matters, he eventually found himself analysing and explaining what meaning is, and thus came to several conclusions that proved highly consequential for the subsequent course of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language.\u000a\u000aIt should be kept in mind that Frege was employed as a mathematician, not a philosopher, and he published his philosophical papers in scholarly journals that often were hard to access outside of the German-speaking world. He never published a philosophical monograph other than ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', much of which was mathematical in content, and the first collections of his writings appeared only after World War II. A volume of English translations of Frege's philosophical essays first appeared in 1952, edited by students of Wittgenstein, [[Peter Geach]] (born 1916) and [[Max Black]] (1909\u201388), with the bibliographic assistance of Wittgenstein (see Geach, ed. 1975, Introduction). Despite the generous praise of Russell and Wittgenstein, Frege was little known as a philosopher during his lifetime. His ideas spread chiefly through those he influenced, such as Russell, Wittgenstein, and Carnap, and through work on logic and semantics by Polish logicians.\u000a\u000a==Sense and reference==\u000a{{Main|Sense and Reference}}\u000aFrege's 1892 paper, ''On Sense and Reference'' ("Über Sinn und Bedeutung"), introduced his influential distinction between ''sense'' ("Sinn") and ''reference'' ("Bedeutung", which has also been translated as "meaning", or "denotation"). While conventional accounts of meaning took expressions to have just one feature (reference), Frege introduced the view that expressions have two different aspects of significance: their sense and their reference.\u000a\u000a''Reference'', (or, "Bedeutung") applied to [[proper names]], where a given expression (say the expression "Tom") simply refers to the entity bearing the name (the person named Tom). Frege also held that propositions had a referential relationship with their truth-value (in other words, a statement "refers" to the truth-value it takes). By contrast, the ''sense'' (or "Sinn") associated with a complete sentence is the thought it expresses. The sense of an expression is said to be the "mode of presentation" of the item referred to, and there can be multiple modes of representation for the same referent.\u000a\u000aThe distinction can be illustrated thus: In their ordinary uses, the name "Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor", which for logical purposes is an unanalyzable whole, and the functional expression "the Prince of Wales", which contains the significant parts "the prince of \u03be" and "Wales", have the same ''reference'', namely, the person best known as Prince Charles. But the ''sense'' of the word "Wales" is a part of the sense of the latter expression, but no part of the sense of the "full name" of Prince Charles.\u000a\u000aThese distinctions were disputed by Bertrand Russell, especially in his paper "[[On Denoting]]"; the controversy has continued into the present, fueled especially by [[Saul Kripke]]'s famous lectures "[[Naming and Necessity]]".\u000a\u000a==1924 diary==\u000aFrege's published philosophical writings were of a very technical nature and divorced from practical issues, so much so that Frege scholar [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] expresses his "shock to discover, while reading Frege's diary, that his hero was an anti-Semite."<ref>Hersh, Reuben, ''What Is Mathematics, Really?''
