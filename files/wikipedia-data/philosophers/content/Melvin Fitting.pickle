At the [[Graduate Center]] he was in the departments of Computer Science, Philosophy, and Mathematics, and at Lehman College he was in the department of Mathematics and Computer Science.  He is now Professor [[emeritus]].  His undergraduate degree is from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and his doctorate is from [[Yeshiva University]], both in mathematics.  His thesis advisor was [[Raymond Smullyan]].\u000a\u000aIn June 2012 Melvin Fitting was given the [[Herbrand Award]] by CADE, for distinguished contributions to [[automated deduction]].{{efn | name=herbrand | http://wp.lehman.edu/lehman-today/2012/05/leading-mathematics-and-computer-sciences-researcher-wins-prestigious-award/ , Leading Mathematics and Computer Sciences Researcher Wins Prestigious Award <!-- WP:ABOUTSELF , this is the university he works for... independent source e.g. newspaper or math-journal which gives winners would be a useful additinoal ref to add --> }}\u000a\u000aA loose motivation for much of Melvin Fitting's work can be formulated succinctly as follows.  There are many logics.  Our principles of reasoning vary with context and subject matter.  Multiplicity is one of the glories of modern formal logic.  The common thread tying logics together is a concern for what can be said (syntax), what that means (semantics), and relationships between the two.  A philosophical position that can be embodied in a formal logic has been shown to be coherent, not correct.  Logic is a tool, not a master, but it is an enjoyable tool to use.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000a{{cleanup|reason=unusual style|date=April 2015}}\u000a* '''Intuitionistic Logic, Model Theory, and Forcing''', [[North-Holland]], Amsterdam, 1969.<!-- book, as of 2014-01-22 had 421 cites on scholar.google.com and 69 cites on academic.research.microsoft.com --> \u000a* Tableau methods of proof for modal logics, [[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]], 13 (2), 237-247 (1972).<!-- paper, as of 2014-01-22 had 93 cites on scholar.google.com and 40 cites on academic.research.microsoft.com --> \u000a* Model existence theorems for modal and intuitionistic logics, [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]], 38, 613-627 (1973).<!-- paper, few cites... keep? -->\u000a* Fundamentals of Generalized Recursion Theory, [[North-Holland]], Amsterdam, 1981.<!-- book, few cites... keep? sounds liek a textbook which may qualify it as WP:NOTEWORTHY --> \u000a* Proof Methods for Modal and Intuitionistic Logics, D.
