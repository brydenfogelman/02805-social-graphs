He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life and education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom.

See ''Cratylus'', 402a.</ref> (see [[#Panta rhei, "everything flows"|panta rhei]], below). This position was complemented by his stark commitment to a [[unity of opposites]] in the world, stating that "the path up and down are one and the same". Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that "all entities come to be in accordance with this ''[[Logos]]''" (literally, "word", "reason", or "account") has been the subject of numerous interpretations.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000a[[File:Efez agora odeon prytaneion RB.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ephesus on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], birthplace of Heraclitus]]\u000aThe main source for the life of Heraclitus is [[Diogenes Laërtius]], although some have questioned the validity of his account as "''a tissue of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] anecdotes, most of them obviously fabricated on the basis of statements in the preserved fragments''."<ref name="kahn">{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=Charles |title=The Art and Thought of Heraclitus: Fragments with Translation and Commentary |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1979 |pages=1\u201323 |isbn=0-521-28645-X}}</ref> Diogenes said that Heraclitus [[floruit|flourished]] in the 69th [[Olympiad]],<ref name="ix1">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 1</ref> 504\u2013501 BC.

His dates of birth and death are based on a life span of 60 years, the age at which Diogenes says he died,<ref name="ix3">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 3</ref> with the floruit in the middle.\u000a\u000aHeraclitus was born to an aristocratic family in [[Ephesus]], in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in what is now called present-day [[Efes, Turkey]]. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn.<ref name="ix1"/> Diogenes says that he [[abdication|abdicated]] the kingship (''basileia'') in favor of his brother<ref name="ix6">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 6</ref> and [[Strabo]] confirms that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges.<ref>Strabo, Chapter 1, section 3.</ref> How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus had been part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] since 547 and was ruled by a [[satrap]], a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play [[knucklebones]] with the youths in the temple of [[Artemis]] and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (''politeia'') was ''ponêra'',<ref name="ix2">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 2</ref> which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and [[Darius I]], quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.<ref>[[Geoffrey Kirk|G. S. Kirk]] (2010), ''Heraclitus: The Cosmic Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, p. 1. ISBN 0521136679</ref>\u000a\u000aWith regard to education, Diogenes says that Heraclitus was "wondrous" (''thaumasios'', which, as Plato explains in the ''Theaetetus'' and elsewhere, is the beginning of philosophy) from childhood. Diogenes relates that [[Sotion]] said he was a "hearer" of [[Xenophanes]], which contradicts Heraclitus' statement (so says Diogenes) that he had taught himself by questioning himself. [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] states in any case that "...&nbsp;Xenophanes left Ionia before Herakleitos was born."<ref>Chapter 3 beginning.</ref> Diogenes relates that as a boy Heraclitus had said he "knew nothing" but later claimed to "know everything."<ref name="ix5">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 5</ref> His statement that he "heard no one" but "questioned himself," can be placed alongside his statement that "the things that can be seen, heard and learned are what I prize the most."<ref>DK B55.</ref>\u000a\u000aDiogenes relates that Heraclitus had a poor opinion of human affairs.<ref name="ix1"/> He believed that [[Hesiod]] and [[Pythagoras]] lacked understanding though learned<ref>DK B40.</ref> and that [[Homer]] and [[Archilochus]] deserved to be beaten.<ref>DK B42.</ref> Laws needed to be defended as though they were city walls.<ref>DK B44.</ref> [[Timon of Phlius|Timon]] is said to have called him a "mob-reviler." Heraclitus hated the [[Athens|Athenians]] and his fellow Ephesians, wishing the latter wealth in punishment for their wicked ways.<ref>DK B125a.</ref> Says Diogenes: "Finally, he became a hater of his kind (''misanthrope'') and wandered the mountains ... making his diet of grass and herbs."\u000a\u000aHeraclitus' life as a philosopher was interrupted by [[edema|dropsy]]. The physicians he consulted were unable to prescribe a cure. Diogenes lists various stories about Heraclitus' death: In two versions, Heraclitus was cured of the dropsy and died of another disease. In one account, however, the philosopher "buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp humour would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure", while another says he treated himself with a [[liniment]] of cow manure and, after a day prone in the sun, died and was interred in the marketplace.  According to Neathes of Cyzicus, after smearing himself with dung, Heraclitus was devoured by dogs.<ref name="ix4">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 4</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fairweather |first=Janet |url=http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/9121/4593 |title=Death of Heraclitus |year=1973 |page=2}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a[[File:Raphael School of Athens Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Heraclitus (with the face and in the style of [[Michelangelo]]) sits apart from the other philosophers in [[Raphael Sanzio|Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]''.]]\u000a{{main|On Nature (Heraclitus)}}\u000aDiogenes states that Heraclitus' work was "a continuous treatise ''On Nature'', but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology." [[Theophrastus]] says (in Diogenes) "...some parts of his work [are] half-finished, while other parts [made] a strange medley."<ref name="ix6"/>\u000a\u000aDiogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of [[Artemis]], the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemisium]], one of the largest temples of the 6th century BC and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances; furthermore, many subsequent philosophers in this period refer to the work. Says [[Charles Kahn|Kahn]]:<ref name="kahn"/> "Down to the time of [[Plutarch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out." Diogenes says:<ref name="ix6"/> "the book acquired such fame that it produced partisans of his philosophy who were called Heracliteans."\u000a\u000aAs with other pre-Socratics, his writings survive now only in [[:s:Fragments of Heraclitus|fragments]] quoted by other authors.\u000a\u000a==Ancient characterizations==\u000a\u000a==="The Obscure"===\u000aAt some time in antiquity he acquired this epithet denoting that his major sayings were difficult to understand. According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]],<ref name="ix6"/> [[Timon of Phlius]] called him "the riddler" ({{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}} ''ainikt\u0113s''), and  explained that Heraclitus wrote his book "rather unclearly" (''asaphesteron'') so that only the "capable" should attempt it. By the time of [[Cicero]] he had become "the dark" ({{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}} \u2014 {{lang|grc-Latn|''ho Skoteinós''}})<ref>''De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'', Chapter 2, Section 15.</ref> because he had spoken ''nimis obscur\u0113'', "too obscurely", concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood.

A soul should therefore aim toward becoming more full of fire and less full of water: a "dry" soul was best.

He typically uses the ordinary word "to become" (''gignesthai'' or ''ginesthai'', present tense or aorist tense of the verb, with the root sense of "being born"), which led to his being characterized as the philosopher of becoming rather than of being. He recognizes the fundamental changing of objects with the flow of time.\u000a\u000a[[Plato]] argues against Heraclitus as follows:<ref>[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]] Paragraph 440 sections c-d.</ref><blockquote>How can that be a real thing which is never in the same state? ... for at the moment that the observer approaches, then they become other ... so that you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state .... but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever ... then I do not think they can resemble a process or flux ....</blockquote>\u000a\u000aIn Plato one experienced unit is a state, or object existing, which can be observed. The time parameter is set at "ever"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations and is thus presumed a function that ''happens to'' objects already in being, rather than something ontologically essential to them (such that something that does not change cannot exist) as in Heraclitus. In Plato, no matter how many of those experienced units you are able to tally, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for the change that must be occurring there. This limitation is considered a fundamental limitation of reality by Plato and in part underpins his differentiation between imperfect experience from more perfect [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. The fact that this is no limitation for Heraclitus motivates Plato's condemnation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\u000a\u000a===Stoics===\u000a[[Stoicism]] was a philosophical school which flourished between the 3rd century BCE and about the 3rd century CE.

In addition to seeing it as the most fundamental of the four elements and the one that is quantified and determines the quantity (''logos'') of the other three, he presents fire as the cosmos, which was not made by any of the gods or men, but "was and is and ever shall be ever-living fire."<ref>DK B60.</ref> Fire is both a substance and a motivator of change, it is active in altering other things quantitatively and performing an activity Heraclitus describes as "the judging and convicting of all things."<ref>DK B66.</ref> It is "the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things."<ref>DK B64.</ref> There is no reason to interpret the judgement, which is actually "to separate" (\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''krinein''), as outside of the context of "strife is justice" (see subsection above).\u000a\u000aThe earliest surviving Stoic work, the ''Hymn to Zeus'' of [[Cleanthes]],<ref>Different translations of this critical piece of literature, transitional from pagan polytheism to the modern religions and philosophies, can be found at {{cite web |first=T.W. |last=Rolleston |title=Stoic Philosophers: Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus |url=http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/4617/stoic/zeus.html |publisher=www.numinism.net |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805153252/http://geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/4617/stoic/zeus.html |archivedate=2009-08-05}} {{cite web |first=M.A.C. |last=Ellery |title=Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/citylife/readings/cleanthes_hymn.html |publisher=Tom Sienkewicz at www.utexas.edu |year=1976 |accessdate=2007-11-28 }} {{cite web |translator=not stated |title=Hymn to Zeus |url=http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Cleanthes.html |publisher=Holy, Holy, Holy at thriceholy.net: Hypatia's Bookshelf }}</ref> though not explicitly referencing Heraclitus, adopts what appears to be the Heraclitean logos modified.

But then, says Cleanthes, Zeus uses the fire to "straighten out the common logos" that travels about (''phoitan'', "to frequent") mixing with the greater and lesser lights (heavenly bodies). This is Heraclitus' logos, but now it is confused with the "common ''nomos''", which Zeus uses to "make the wrong (''perissa'', left or odd) right (''artia'', right or even)" and "order (''kosmein'') the disordered (''akosma'')."<ref>The ancient Greek can be found in {{cite book |first=E.H. |last=Blakeney |author-link=Edward Henry Blakeney |title=The Hymn of Cleanthes: Greek Text Translated into English: with Brief Introduction and Notes |location=New York |publisher=The MacMillan Company }} Downloadable Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-gqSkvGz-kC&pg=PA2&dq=Hymn+to+Zeus+Cleanthes&as_brr=3&ei=nQ9QR6fdNIuEpgK-o4DyDQ#PPA1,M1].</ref>\u000a\u000aThe Stoic modification of Heraclitus' idea of the Logos was also influential on [[Judaism|Jewish]] philosophers such as [[Philo]] of Alexandria, who connected it to "Wisdom personified" <!--{Sophia?} --> as God's creative principle. Philo uses the term Logos throughout his treatises on Hebrew Scripture in a manner clearly influenced by the Stoics.\u000a\u000a===Church fathers===\u000a[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Democritus|Democriet]] (laughing) & Herakliet (crying) by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]]]]\u000aThe [[church fathers]] were the leaders of the early [[Christian Church]] during its first five centuries of existence, roughly contemporaneous to Stoicism under the [[Roman Empire]]. The works of dozens of writers in hundreds of pages have survived.\u000a\u000aAll of them had something to say about the Christian form of the [[Logos]]. The Catholic Church found it necessary to distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. [[Hippolytus of Rome]] therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other [[Pre-Socratics]] (and [[Platonic Academy|Academics]]) as sources of [[heresy]]. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.\u000a\u000aIn ''Refutation of All Heresies''<ref>Book IX leading sentence.</ref> Hippolytus says: "What the blasphemous folly is of [[Noetus]], and that he devoted himself to the tenets of Heraclitus the Obscure, not to those of Christ." Hippolytus then goes on to present the inscrutable DK B67: "God (''theos'') is day and night, winter and summer, ... but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each." The fragment seems to support [[pantheism]] if taken literally. German physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernard Weinstein]] classed these views with [[pandeism]].<ref name="Weinstein-Greece">Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), p. 233: "Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) herrühren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abkühlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet. Daß Gott als feurig gedacht wird (jedoch auch als Atem oder Äther) ist dem Menschen entnommen, dessen Wärme sein Lebensprinzip bedeutet; eine Idee, die sich schon bei den ersten griechischen Philosophen und namentlich bei Heraklit findet."</ref>\u000a\u000aHippolytus condemns the obscurity of it. He cannot accuse Heraclitus of being a heretic so he says instead: "Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure anticipate Noetus in framing a system ...?" The apparent pantheist deity of Heraclitus (if that is what DK B67 means) must be equal to the union of opposites and therefore must be corporeal and incorporeal, divine and not-divine, dead and alive, etc., and the [[Trinity]] can only be reached by some sort of illusory shape-shifting.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hippolytus |title=Refutation of All Heresies |pages=Book IX Chapter 5 |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050109.htm |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThe Apologist Justin Martyr, however, took a much more positive view of him.
