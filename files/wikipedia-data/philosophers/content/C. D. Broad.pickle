Broad''', was an English [[epistemology|epistemologist]], [[history of philosophy|historian of philosophy]], [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[ethics|moral philosopher]], and writer on the philosophical aspects of psychical research. He was known for his thorough and dispassionate examinations of [[argument]]s in such works as ''Scientific Thought'', published in 1923, ''The Mind and Its Place in Nature'', published in 1925, and ''An Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy'', published in 1933.\u000a\u000aBroad's essay on "Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism" in ''Ethics and the History of Philosophy'' (1952) introduced the philosophical terms "occurrent causation" and "non-occurrent causation", which became the basis for today's "agent causal" and "event causal" distinctions in the debates on [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] [[free will]].\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aBroad was born in [[Harlesden]], in [[Middlesex]], England.<ref>Harlesden was part of Middlesex until 1965; today it is part of the [[London Borough of Brent]] in [[Greater London]].</ref> He was educated at [[Dulwich College]] from 1900 until 1906.<ref>Hodges, S. (1981): "God's Gift. A Living History of Dulwich College", London: Heinemann, p. 87</ref>  He gained a scholarship to study at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1906. In 1910 he graduated with [[British undergraduate degree classification|First-Class Honours]], with distinction.\u000a\u000aIn 1911, he became a Fellow of Trinity College. This was a non-residential position, which enabled him to also accept a position he had applied for as an assistant lecturer at [[St Andrews University]]. He was later made a lecturer at [[St Andrews University]], and remained there until 1920. He was appointed professor at [[Bristol University]] in 1920, and worked there until 1923, when he returned to Trinity College as a College lecturer. He was a lecturer in 'moral science' in the [[Faculty of philosophy cambridge|Faculty of philosophy at Cambridge University]] from 1926 until 1931. In 1931, he was appointed 'Sidgwick Lecturer' at Cambridge University. He kept this role until 1933, when he was appointed [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy|Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at Cambridge University, a position he held for twenty years, until 1953.\u000a\u000aBroad was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1927 to 1928, and again from 1954 to 1955. He was also President of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1935 and 1958.\u000a\u000aBroad was openly homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. In March 1958, Broad along with fellow philosophers [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], writer [[J.B. Priestley]], and 27 others, sent a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' which urged the acceptance of the ''[[Wolfenden Report]]'s'' recommendation that homosexual acts should 'no longer be a criminal offence'.<ref>[[Noel Gilroy Annan|Annan, N.G.]], [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]], [[A.

'Letter to the Editor'. ''[[The Times]]''.</ref>\u000a\u000a== Psychical research ==\u000aBroad argued that if research showed that psychic events occur, this would challenge philosophical theories of "[[basic limiting principles]]" in at least five ways:\u000a\u000a# [[Backward causation]], the future affecting the past, is rejected by many philosophers, but would be shown to occur if, for example, people could predict the future.\u000a# One common argument against [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], that is the belief that minds are non-physical, and bodies physical, is that physical and non-physical things cannot interact. However, this would be shown to be possible if people can move physical objects by thought ([[telekinesis]]).\u000a# Similarly, philosophers tend to be [[Skepticism|skeptical]] about claims that non-physical 'stuff' could interact with anything. This would also be challenged if [[mind]]s are shown to be able to communicate with each other, as would be the case if [[telepathy|mind-reading]] is possible.\u000a# Philosophers generally accept that we can only learn about the world through [[reason]] and [[perception]]. This belief would be challenged if people were able to psychically perceive events in other places.\u000a# [[Physicalism|Physicalist]] philosophers believe that there cannot be persons without bodies. If ghosts were shown to exist, this view would be challenged.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100007452 | last1 = Broad | first1 = C.

The agent could be considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent. Thus our efforts would be completely determined, but their causes would not be prior events.\u000a\u000aNew series of events would then originate which he called "continuants." These are essentially ''[[causa sui]]''.\u000a\u000a[[Peter van Inwagen]] says that Broad formulated an excellent version of what van Inwagen has called the "Consequence Argument" in defense of [[incompatibilism]].\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000a* [http://www.ditext.com/broad/ppr/ppr.html ''Perception, physics and reality.
