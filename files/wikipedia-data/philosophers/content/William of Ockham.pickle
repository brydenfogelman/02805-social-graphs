He believed that science was a matter of discovery and saw God as the only ontological necessity.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on William Ockham]</ref> His importance is as a theologian with a strongly developed interest in logical method, and whose approach was critical rather than system building.<ref name="English Literature Pp 735"/>\u000a\u000a==Philosophical thought==\u000a[[File:Guillelmus - Quaestiones in quattuor libros sententiarum - 4417303 Carta 25r.tif|thumb|''Quaestiones in quattuor libros sententiarum'']]\u000aIn [[scholasticism]], Ockham advocated for a reform both in method and in content, the aim of which was simplification. Ockham incorporated much of the work of some previous theologians, especially [[John Duns Scotus]]. From Scotus, Ockham derived his view of divine omnipotence, his view of grace and justification, much of his epistemology{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and ethical convictions. However, he also reacted to and against Scotus in the areas of predestination, penance, his understanding of universals, his formal distinction ''ex parte rei'' (that is, "as applied to created things"), and his view of parsimony which became known as [[Occam's Razor]].\u000a\u000a===Nominalism===\u000aOckham was a pioneer of [[nominalism]], and some consider him the father of modern [[epistemology]], because of his strongly argued position that only individuals exist, rather than supra-individual [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]], essences, or forms, and that universals are the products of abstraction from individuals by the human mind and have no extra-mental existence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann  | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}</ref> He denied the real existence of metaphysical universals and advocated the reduction of [[ontology]]. Ockham is sometimes considered an advocate of [[conceptualism]] rather than nominalism, for whereas nominalists held that universals were merely names, i.e. words rather than existing realities, conceptualists held that they were mental [[concept]]s, i.e. the names were names of concepts, which do exist, although only in the mind. Therefore, the universal concept has for its object, not a reality existing in the world outside us, but an internal representation which is a product of the understanding itself and which "supposes" in the mind the things to which the mind attributes it; that is, it holds, for the time being, the place of the things which it represents. It is the term of the reflective act of the mind. Hence the universal is not a mere word, as [[Roscellinus|Roscelin]] taught, nor a ''sermo'', as [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] held, namely the word as used in the sentence, but the mental substitute for real things, and the term of the reflective process. For this reason Ockham has sometimes also been called a "terminist", to distinguish him from a nominalist or a conceptualist.<ref>{{Cite CE1913 | wstitle = William of Ockham | author =William Turner}}</ref>\u000a\u000aOckham was a theological [[Voluntarism (theology)|voluntarist]] who believed that if God had wanted to, he could have become incarnate as a donkey or an ox, or even as both a donkey and a man at the same time. He was criticized for this belief by his fellow theologians and philosophers.<ref name="grenz">{{cite book|title=The Named God and the Question Of Being: A Trinitarian Theo-Ontology|author= Stanley J. Grenz}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Efficient reasoning===\u000aOne important contribution that he made to modern science and modern intellectual culture was efficient reasoning with the principle of parsimony in explanation and theory building that came to be known as [[Occam's Razor]]. This maxim, as interpreted by [[Bertrand Russell]],<ref name="russell">{{cite book\u000a  | last = Russell\u000a  | first = Bertrand\u000a  | title = History of Western Philosophy\u000a  | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]]\u000a  | year = 2000\u000a  | pages = 462\u2013463\u000a  | isbn = 0-415-22854-9 }}</ref> states that if one can explain a phenomenon without assuming this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it, i.e. that one should always opt for an explanation in terms of the fewest possible causes, factors, or variables. He turned this into a concern for ontological parsimony; the principle says that one should not multiply entities beyond necessity \u2013 ''Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate'' \u2013 although this well-known formulation of the principle is not to be found in any of Ockham's extant writings.<ref name="thorburn">{{cite journal |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Occam%27s_Razor | title=The Myth of Occam's Razor| journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] | author=W.

''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham''. Cambridge University Press, 1999: 104.</ref> For Ockham, the only truly necessary entity is God; everything else is contingent. He thus does not accept the [[principle of sufficient reason]], rejects the distinction between essence and existence, and advocates against the [[Thomism|Thomistic doctrine]] of active and passive intellect. His scepticism to which his ontological parsimony request leads appears in his doctrine that human reason can prove neither the immortality of the soul nor the existence, unity, and infinity of God. These truths, he teaches, are known to us by revelation alone.\u000a\u000a===Natural philosophy===\u000aOckham wrote a great deal on [[natural philosophy]], including a long commentary on [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]. According to the principle of ontological parsimony, he holds that we do not need to allow entities in all ten of Aristotle's categories; we thus do not need the category of quantity, as the mathematical entities are not "real". Mathematics must be applied to other categories, such as the categories of substance or qualities, thus anticipating modern scientific renaissance while violating Aristotelian prohibition of ''metabasis''.\u000a\u000a===Theory of knowledge===\u000aIn the theory of knowledge, Ockham rejected the scholastic theory of species, as unnecessary and not supported by experience, in favour of a theory of abstraction. This was an important development in late medieval [[epistemology]]. He also distinguished between intuitive and abstract cognition; intuitive cognition depends on the existence or non existence of the object, whereas abstractive cognition "abstracts" the object from the existence predicate. Interpreters are, as yet, undecided about the roles of these two types of cognitive activities.\u000a\u000a===Political theory===\u000aOckham is also increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to the development of Western constitutional ideas,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} especially those of government with limited responsibility.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He was one of the first medieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and was important for the early development of the notion of property rights. His political ideas are regarded as "natural" or "secular",{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} holding for a secular absolutism.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The views on monarchical accountability espoused in his ''Dialogus'' (written between 1332 and 1347)<ref>Cf. the online British Academy edition at http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/ockdial.html</ref> greatly influenced [[Conciliarism|the Conciliar movement]] and assisted in the emergence of liberal democratic ideologies.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\u000a\u000aOckham was for complete separation of spiritual rule and earthly rule. He thought that the pope and churchmen have no right or grounds at all for secular rule like having property, citing 2 Tim. 2:4. That belongs solely to earthly rulers, who may also accuse the pope of crimes, if need be.<ref name=vm>Virpi Mäkinen, ''Keskiajan aatehistoria'',  Atena Kustannus Oy, Jyväskylä, 2003, ISBN 9517963106, 9789517963107. Pages 160, 167-168, 202, 204, 207-209.</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter the Fall the God had given men, also non-Christians, two powers: private ownership and the right to set their rulers, who should serve the interest of the people, not some special interests. Thus he preceded [[Thomas Hobbes]] in formulating [[social contract]] theory along with earlier scholars.<ref name=vm/>\u000a\u000aOckham said that the Franciscans avoided both private and common ownership by using commodities, including food and clothes, without any rights, with mere ''usus facti'', the ownership still belonging to the donor of the item or to the pope. Their opponents such as pope [[John XXII]] wrote that use without any ownership cannot be justified: "''It is impossible that an external deed could be just if the person has no right to do it.''" <ref name=vm/>\u000a\u000aThus the disputes on the heresy of Franciscans lead Ockham and others formulate some fundamentals of economic theory and the theory of ownership.<ref name=vm/>\u000a\u000a===Logic===\u000aIn [[logic]], Ockham wrote down in words the formulae that would later be called [[De Morgan's Laws]],<ref>In his ''Summa Logicae'', part II, sections 32 and 33.Translated on page 80 of ''Philosophical Writings'', tr.
