In 1935, he [[Aliyah|emigrated]] with his family to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate Palestine]]. As a young boy, he was very interested in mathematics and his father sent him to the best high school in [[Haifa]], where he studied under a significant practicing mathematician, [[Elisha Netanyahu]], who was then a high school teacher.<ref name="CACM 2 2010">[[Dennis Shasha|Shasha, Dennis]], [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69370-an-interview-with-michael-rabin/abstract "An Interview with Michael O. Rabin"], ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 53 No. 2, Pages 37-42, February 2010.</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter high school, he was drafted into the army during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The mathematician [[Abraham Fraenkel]], who was a professor of mathematics in [[Jerusalem]], intervened with the army command, and Rabin was discharged to study at the university in 1949.<ref name="CACM 2 2010"/>\u000a\u000aHe received an M.Sc. from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1953 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1956.\u000a\u000aIn the late 1950s, he was invited for a summer to do research for [[IBM]] at the Lamb Estate in [[Westchester County, New York]] with other promising mathematicians and scientists. It was there that he and [[Dana Scott]] wrote the paper "Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems".<ref name="RS59">{{cite journal|last1=Scott |first1=Dana |authorlink1=Dana Scott |last2=Rabin |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Michael O.

[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] posed a puzzle to him about spies, guards, and password which Rabin studied and soon after he wrote an article, "Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets."<ref name="CACM 2 2010"/><ref>Rabin, M.O., "Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets", Technical Report No. 2, O.N.R., Hebrew University,  Jerusalem, 1960</ref>\u000a\u000a[[Nondeterministic machine]]s have become a key concept in computational complexity theory, particularly with the description of [[P = NP problem|complexity classes P and NP]].\u000a\u000aRabin then returned to Jerusalem, researching logic, and working on the foundations of what would later be known as [[computer science]]. He was an associate professor and the head of the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University at 29 years old, and a full professor by 33. Rabin recalls, "There was absolutely no appreciation of the work on the issues of computing. Mathematicians did not recognize the emerging new field".<ref name="CACM 2 2010"/>\u000a\u000aIn 1960, he was invited by [[Edward F. Moore]] to work at [[Bell Labs]], where Rabin introduced probabilistic automata that employ coin tosses in order to decide which state transitions to take. He showed examples of regular languages that required a very large number of states, but for which you get an exponential reduction of the number of states if you go over to probabilistic automata.<ref name="CACM 2 2010"/>\u000a\u000aIn 1969, Rabin proved that the [[second-order logic|second-order theory]] of n successors is [[Decidable language|decidable]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Rabin|first = MO|title= Decidability of second order theories and automata on infinite trees|journal = Trans.

[[Gary Miller (professor)|Gary Miller]] was also there and had his [[polynomial]] time test for primality based on the [[Generalized Riemann hypothesis|extended Riemann hypothesis]]. While there, Rabin invented the [[Miller-Rabin primality test]], a randomized algorithm that can determine very quickly (but with a tiny probability of error) whether a number is [[prime number|prime]].<ref>{{cite conference|last = Rabin|first = MO|title = Probabilistic algorithms|booktitle = Algorithms and Complexity, Proc.

Fast primality testing is key in the successful implementation of most public-key cryptography, and in 2003 Miller, Rabin, [[Robert M. Solovay]], and [[Volker Strassen]] were given the [[Paris Kanellakis Award]] for their work on primality testing.\u000a\u000aIn 1976 he was invited by [[Joseph F. Traub|Joseph Traub]] to meet at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and presented the primality test. After he gave that lecture, Traub had said, "No, no, this is revolutionary, and it's going to become very important."<ref name="CACM 2 2010"/>\u000a\u000aIn 1979, Rabin invented the [[Rabin cryptosystem]], the first asymmetric cryptosystem whose security was proved equivalent to the intractability of [[integer factorization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rabin |first=MO |title=Digitalized signatures and public-key functions as intractable as factorization |journal=MIT Laboratory of Computer Science Technical Report |date=January 1979 |url=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-212.pdf |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921155009/http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-212.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2006 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1981, Rabin reinvented a weak variant of the technique of [[oblivious transfer]] invented by Wiesner under the name of multiplexing,<ref>{{Cite book|last = Rabin|first = Michael O.|title = How to exchange secrets by oblivious transfer (Technical Report TR-81)|place = Aiken Computation Laboratory|publisher = Harvard University|year = 1981|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/187.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> allowing a sender to transmit a message to a receiver where the receiver has some probability between 0 and 1 of learning the message, with the sender being unaware whether the receiver was able to do so.\u000a\u000aIn 1987, Rabin, together with [[Richard Karp]], created one of the most well-known efficient [[string search algorithm]]s, the [[Rabin-Karp string search algorithm]], known for its rolling hash.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1147/rd.312.0249|last = Karp|first = RM|author2=Rabin, MO|title = Efficient randomized pattern-matching algorithms|journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume = 31|issue = 2|date=March 1987|pages = 249\u2013260|url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1012156.1012171|accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref>\u000a\u000aRabin's more recent research has concentrated on computer security. He is currently the [[Thomas J. Watson|Thomas J. Watson Sr.]] Professor of Computer Science at [[Harvard University]] and Professor of Computer Science at [[Hebrew University]]. During the spring semester of 2007, he was a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] teaching ''Introduction to [[Cryptography]]''.\u000a\u000aRabin is a foreign member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], a member of the\u000a[[French Academy of Sciences]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Society]].\u000a\u000aHe was also the PhD advisor of [[Saharon Shelah]], a researcher in [[mathematical logic]].\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000aIn 1976, the [[Turing Award]] was awarded jointly to Rabin and [[Dana Scott]] for a paper written in 1959, the citation for which states that the award was granted:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a''For their joint paper "Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems," which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept.
