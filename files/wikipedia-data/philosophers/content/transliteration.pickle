S. & Salman, A. (2011) The English Transliteration of Place Names in Oman. Journal of Academic and Applied Studies Vol. 1(3) September 2011, pp. 1\u201327 Available online at www.academians.org</ref>\u000a\u000aFor instance, a Latin transliteration of the Greek phrase "{{lang|el|\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}", usually translated as 'Hellenic Republic', is "{{transl|el|Ell\u0113nik\u1e17 D\u0113mokratía}}".\u000a\u000aTransliteration is not concerned with representing the [[phonetics|sounds]] of the original, only the characters, ideally accurately and unambiguously. Thus, in the above example, \u03bb\u03bb is transliterated as 'll', but pronounced /l/; \u0394 is transliterated as 'D', but pronounced 'ð'; and \u03b7 is transliterated as '\u0113', though it is pronounced /i/ (exactly like \u03b9) and is not [[vowel length|long]].\u000a\u000aConversely, [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] notes the ''sounds'' but not necessarily the spelling. So "{{lang|el|\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}}" could be transcribed as "{{transl|el|elinikí ðimokratía}}", which does not specify which of the /i/ sounds are written as \u03b7 and which as \u03b9.\u000a\u000a==Definitions==\u000aSystematic transliteration is a [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] from one system of writing into another, typically grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are [[one-to-one correspondence|one-to-one]], so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling.\u000a\u000aTransliteration is opposed to [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], which maps the ''[[Phone (phonetics)|sounds]]'' of one [[language]] into a writing system. Still, most systems of transliteration map the letters of the source script to letters pronounced similarly in the target script, for some specific pair of source and target language. If the relations between letters and sounds are similar in both languages, a transliteration may be very close to a transcription. In practice, there are some mixed transliteration/transcription systems that transliterate a part of the original script and transcribe the rest.\u000a\u000aFor many script pairs, there is one or more standard transliteration systems. However, unsystematic transliteration is common.\u000a\u000a== Difference from transcription ==\u000aIn Modern [[Greek language|Greek]] (and since the Roman Imperial period), the letters &lt;\u03b7&gt; &lt;\u03b9&gt; &lt;\u03c5&gt; and the letter combinations &lt;\u03b5\u03b9&gt; &lt;o\u03b9&gt; &lt;\u03c5\u03b9&gt; are pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} (except when pronounced as [[semivowel]]s), and a modern transcription renders them all as &lt;i&gt;; but a transliteration distinguishes them, for example by transliterating to &lt;\u0113&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;y&gt; and &lt;ei&gt; &lt;oi&gt; &lt;yi&gt;. (As the ancient pronunciation of &lt;\u03b7&gt; was {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, it is often transliterated as an &lt;e&gt; with a [[macron]], even for modern texts.) On the other hand, &lt;\u03b5\u03c5&gt; is sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[ev]}} and sometimes {{IPA|[ef]}}, depending on the following sound. A transcription distinguishes them, but this is no requirement for a transliteration. The initial letter 'h' reflecting the historical [[rough breathing]] in words such as Ell\u0113nik\u0113 should logically be omitted in transcription from [[Koine Greek]] on,<ref>See [[Koine Greek phonology]].</ref> and from transliteration from [[Greek diacritics|1982 on]], but it is nonetheless frequently encountered.\u000a\u000a{| class="wikitable"\u000a|-\u000a!

A source word can be transliterated by first identifying all the applicable prefix and suffix ''segments'' based on the letters in the source word. All of these segments, in combination constitute a list of potential partial transliterations. So a partial transliteration can include only prefix or only suffix segments. A partial transliteration will also include some unmapped letters of the source word, namely those letters between the end of the prefix and the beginning of the suffix. The partial transliteration can be \u201cfilled in\u201d by applying additional segment maps. Applying the segment maps can produce additional transliterations if more than one segment mapping applies to a particular combination of characters in the source word.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2008/0221866.html Machine Learning For Transliteration]</ref>\u000a\u000aSome examples or "partial transliterations" are words like "bishop" via [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''biscep'' from the Greek word "''episkopos''" and the word "deacon", which is partially transliterated from the Greek word "''diakonos''".\u000a\u000a== Challenges ==\u000aA simple example of difficulties in transliteration is the [[voiceless uvular plosive]] used in [[Arabic]] and other languages. It is pronounced approximately like English [k], except that the tongue makes contact not on the [[soft palate]] but on the [[uvula]]. Pronunciation varies between different languages, and different dialects of the same language. The consonant is sometimes transliterated into "g", sometimes "k", and sometimes "q" in English.<ref>[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2989 Language log]</ref> Another example is the Russian letter [[Kha (Cyrillic)|"\u0425" (kha)]]. It is pronounced as the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}, like the Scottish pronunciation of {{angbr|ch}} in "lo'''ch'''". This sound is not present in most forms of English, and is often transliterated as "kh", as in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Many languages have phonemic sounds, such as [[click consonant]]s, which are quite unlike any phoneme in the language into which they are being transliterated.\u000a\u000aSome languages and scripts present particular difficulties to transcribers.
