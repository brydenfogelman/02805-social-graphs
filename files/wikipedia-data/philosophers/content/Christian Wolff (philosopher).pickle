The mountain [[Mons Wolff]] on the Moon is named in his honor.\u000a\u000aWolff was the most eminent German philosopher between [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].  His main achievement was a complete ''oeuvre'' on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationality]] in Germany.\u000a\u000aWolff was also the creator of German as the language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in [[Latin]], so that an international audience could, and did, read him.  A founding father of, among other fields, economics and [[public administration]] as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000a[[File:Wolff-tablica.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Plaque on building in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] (''Breslau'') where Wolff was born and lived, 1679\u201399]]\u000a\u000aWolff was born in [[Breslau]], [[Habsburg Silesia|Silesia]] (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland), into a modest family. He studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Jena]], soon adding philosophy. In 1703, he qualified as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at [[Leipzig University]],<ref>His ''[[Habilitation]]'' thesis title was ''Philosophia practica universalis, methodo mathematica conscripta'' (''On Universal Practical Philosophy, Composed from the Mathematical Method'').</ref> where he lectured until 1706, when he was called as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. By this time he had made the acquaintance of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence), of whose philosophy his own system is a modified version. At Halle, Wolff at first restricted himself to mathematics, but on the departure of a colleague, he added physics, and soon included all the main philosophical disciplines.\u000a\u000aHowever, the claims Wolff advanced on behalf of [[rationalism|philosophical reason]] appeared impious to his theological colleagues. Halle was the headquarters of [[Pietism]], which, after a long struggle against [[Lutheran]] [[dogma]]tism, had itself assumed the characteristics of a new orthodoxy. Wolff's professed ideal was to base theological truths on mathematically certain evidence. Strife with the Pietists broke out openly in 1721, when Wolff, on the occasion of stepping down as pro-rector, delivered an oration "On the Practical Philosophy of the Chinese" (Eng. tr. 1750), in which he praised the purity of the moral precepts of [[Confucius]], pointing to them as an evidence of the power of human reason to reach moral truth by its own efforts.\u000a\u000a[[File:Delftware plaque with chinoiserie, 17th c.

His successors were [[Joachim Lange]], a pietist, and his son. His enemies had gained the ear of the king [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] and told him that, if Wolff's determinism were recognized, no soldier who deserted could be punished, since he would only have acted as it was necessarily predetermined that he should. This so enraged the king that he immediately deprived Wolff of his office, and commanded him to leave Prussian territory within 48 hours or be hanged. The same day Wolff passed into Saxony, and presently proceeded to [[Marburg]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], to whose university (the [[University of Marburg]]) he had received a call even before this crisis, which was now renewed. The [[Landgraf|Landgrave]] of Hesse received him with every mark of distinction, and the circumstances of his expulsion drew universal attention to his philosophy. It was everywhere discussed, and over two hundred books and pamphlets appeared for or against it before 1737, not reckoning the systematic treatises of Wolff and his followers.\u000a\u000aAccording to [[Jonathan I.

His entry into the town on 6 December 1740 took on the character of a triumphal procession. In 1743, he became chancellor of the university, and in 1745, he received the title of ''Freiherr'' ([[Baron]]) from the Elector of [[Bavaria]]. But his matter was no longer fashionable, he had outlived his power of attracting students, and his class-rooms remained, while not empty, then certainly emptier than they had been during his heyday in Marburg.\u000a\u000aWhen Wolff died on 9 April 1754, he was a very wealthy man, almost entirely due to his income from lecture-fees, salaries, and royalties.  He was also a member of many academies and probably the first scholar to have been created hereditary [[Baron]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the basis of his academic work.  His school, the Wolffians, was the first school, in the philosophical sense, associated with a German philosopher.  It dominated Germany until the rise of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianism]].\u000a\u000a==Philosophy==\u000a[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]]]\u000a\u000aChristian Wolff redefined philosophy as the science of the possible, and applied it in a comprehensive survey of human knowledge to the disciplines of his time.  Wolffian philosophy has a marked insistence everywhere on a clear and methodic exposition, holding confidence in the power of reason to reduce all subjects to this form. He was distinguished for writing copies in both Latin and German. Wolff's teachings held virtually undisputed sway in Germany till the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] revolution, and even after that, Wolff continued to be regarded as one of the most important philosophers from German-speaking lands.\u000a\u000aUntil the 1960s, it was usually maintained by historians that Wolff's philosophy amounted to a common-sense adaptation or watering-down of the [[Leibnizian]] system; or, more charitably, Wolff was said to have methodized and "reduced" to dogmatic form the thoughts of his great predecessor. The Wolffian system retains the determinism and optimism of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], but the [[monadology]] recedes into the background, the monads falling asunder into souls or conscious beings on the one hand and mere atoms on the other. The doctrine of the pre-established harmony also loses its metaphysical significance (while remaining an important [[heuristic]] device), and the [[principle of sufficient reason]]  is once more discarded in favor of the [[principle of contradiction]] which Wolff seeks to make the fundamental principle of philosophy.\u000a\u000aWolff had philosophy divided into a theoretical and a practical part. Logic, sometimes called ''philosophia rationalis'', forms the introduction or [[propaedeutics]] to both. Theoretical philosophy had for its parts [[ontology]] or ''philosophia prima'', [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]], rational psychology, and natural theology; ontology treats of the existent in general, cosmology of the world as a whole, psychology of the soul as a simple non-extended substance, and [[rational theology]] of the existence and attributes of God. These are best known to philosophical students by Kant's treatment of them in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Practical philosophy is subdivided into ethics, economics and politics. Wolff's moral principle is the realization of human perfection{{mdash}}seen realistically as the kind of perfection the human person actually can achieve in the world in which we live. It is perhaps the combination of Enlightenment optimism and worldly realism that made Wolff so successful and popular as a teacher of future statesmen and business leaders.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000aWolff's most important works are as follows:\u000a*''Dissertatio algebraica de algorithmo infinitesimali differentiali'' (''Dissertation on the Algebra of Solving Differential Equations Using Infinitesimals''; 1704)<ref>Available online on [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PID=PPN599485728 Göttinger Digitalisierungszentrum].</ref>\u000a*''Anfangsgründe aller mathematischen Wissenschaften'' (1710); in Latin, ''Elementa matheseos universae'' (1713\u20131715)\u000a*''Vernünftige Gedanken von den Kräften des menschlichen Verstandes'' (1712).
