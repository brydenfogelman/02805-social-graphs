He is a Professor of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. \u000a\u000a==Early life and education==\u000aHrushovski's father, [[Benjamin Harshav]] (né Hruszowski; 1928-2015),<ref>Archives, [[Ghetto Fighters' House]]</ref> was a [[literary theorist]], a Yiddish and Hebrew [[poet]] and a translator, [[Professor]] at [[Yale University]] and [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[comparative literature]]. Hrushovski earned his PhD from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986 under [[Leo Harrington]] He was Professor of Mathematics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] until 1998 before he went to Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\u000a\u000a==Career==\u000aHrushovski is well known for fundamental and important contributions to [[model theory]], in particular in the branch that has become known as [[geometric model theory]], and its applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} His PhD thesis revolutionized stable model theory (a part of model theory arising from the stability theory introduced by [[Saharon Shelah]]). Shortly afterwards he found counterexamples to the [[Trichotomy Conjecture]] of [[Boris Zilber]] and his method of proof has become well known as Hrushovski constructions and found many other applications since.\u000a\u000aIn 1996, Hrushovski found a proof the geometric [[Mordell\u2013Lang conjecture]] in all characteristics using model theory. This deep proof was a landmark in logic and geometry. He has had many other famous results in model theory and applications to [[Diophantine geometry]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\u000a\u000aHrushovski is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (2007), and [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (2008).\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a* [[Zariski geometry]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a* [http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehud/ Ehud Hrushovski at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem]\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Hrushovski, Ehud}}\u000a[[Category:Israeli mathematicians]]\u000a[[Category:Logicians]]\u000a[[Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty]]\u000a[[Category:Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]\u000a[[Category:American Jews]]\u000a[[Category:Israeli Jews]]\u000a[[Category:1959 births]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a[[Category:Model theorists]]\u000a[[Category:Tarski lecturers]]
