He was also briefly a member of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aGuy Debord was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1931. Guy's father, Martial, was a pharmacist who died due to illness when Guy was young. Guy's mother, Paulette Rossi, sent Guy to live with his grandmother in her family villa in Italy. During World War II, the Rossis left the villa and began to travel from town to town. As a result, Guy attended high school in Cannes, where he began his interest in film and [[vandalism]].<ref>Bourseiller, Christophe. "Vie et Mort de Guy Debord". Agora.</ref> As a young man, Debord actively opposed the [[Algerian War|French war in Algeria]] and joined in demonstrations in Paris against it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/guillaume.html|title=Pierre Guillaume Remembers Guy Debord|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Involvement with the Letterists ==\u000aDebord joined the Letterist International when he was 19. The Letterists were led dictatorially by [[Isidore Isou]] until a widely agreed upon schism ended Isou's authority. This schism gave rise to several factions of Letterists, one of which was decidedly led by Debord upon Gil Wolman's unequivocal recommendation.<ref>Bourseiller, ibid</ref> In the 1960s, Debord led the [[Situationist International]] group, which influenced the Paris Uprising of [[May 1968 in France|1968]]. Some consider his book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) to be a catalyst for the uprising.<ref>Andreotti, L. "Review: Leaving the twentieth century: The Situationist International." ''Journal of Architectural Education, 49''(3), p. 197.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Founding of the Situationist International==\u000aIn 1957, the Lettrist International, the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] gathered in Cosio d'Arroscia (Cuneo), Italy, to found the Situationist International, with Debord having been the leading representative of the Lettrist delegation. Initially made up of a number of well known artists such as Asger Jorn and Pinot Gallizio, the early days of the SI were heavily focused on the formulation of a critique of art, which would serve as a foundation for the group's future entrance into further political critiques. The SI was known for a number of its interventions in the art world, which included one raid against an international art conference in Belgium during 1958 <ref>Internationale Situationniste No. 1, June 1958, pages 29-30,</ref> that included a large pamphlet drop and significant media coverage, all of which culminated in the arrest of various situationists and sympathizers associated with the scandal. In addition to this action, the SI endeavored to formulate industrial painting, or, painting prepared en masse with the intent of defaming the original value largely associated with the art of the period. In the course of these actions, Debord was heavily involved in the planning and logistical work associated with preparing these interventions, as well as the work for ''Internationale Situationniste'' associated with theoretical defense of the Situationist International's actions.<ref>Debord, Guy. ''Correspondence: The Founding of the Situationist International. ''Semiotext(e). 2008.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Political phase of the Situationist International==\u000aIn the early 1960s Debord began to direct the SI toward an end of its artistic phase, eventually excluding members such as Jorn, Gallizio, Troche, and Constant - the bulk of the "artistic" wing of the SI - by 1965. Having established the situationist critique of art as a social and political critique, one not to be carried out in traditional artistic activities, the SI began, due in part to Debord's contributions, to pursue a more concise theoretical critique of capitalist society.\u000a\u000aWith Debord's 1967 work, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', and excerpts from the group's journal, ''Internationale Situationniste'', the Situationists began to formulate their theory of the spectacle, which explained the nature of late capitalism's historical decay. In Debord's terms, situationists defined the spectacle as an assemblage of social relations transmitted via the imagery of class power, and as a period of capitalist development wherein "all that was once lived has moved into representation".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} With this theory, Debord and the SI would go on to play an influential role in the [[May 1968 events in France|revolts of May 1968 in France]], with many of the protesters drawing their slogans from Situationist tracts penned or influenced by Debord.<ref>\u000aKnabb, Ken.

Debord was suspected of Lebovici's murder. Distraught by these accusations and his friend's death, Debord took his films and writings out of production until after his death, when he agreed to have his films released at the request of the American researcher, [[Thomas Y. Levin]].<ref>Guy Debord, "Reflections of the Death of Gérard Lebovici"</ref> Debord's two most recognized films date from this period: a film version of ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1973) and "{{Ill|fr|In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni}}" (1978).\u000a\u000aAfter the dissolution of the Situationist International, Debord spent his time reading, and occasionally writing, in relative isolation in a cottage at Champot with Alice Becker-Ho, his second wife. He continued to correspond on political and other issues, notably with Lebovici and the Italian situationist [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/debord.html|title=Guy Debord|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> He focused on reading material relating to war strategies, e.g. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] and [[Sun Tzu]], and he designed a [[A Game of War|war game]] with [[Alice Becker-Ho]].<ref>[http://www.amazon.fr/dp/2070776514 Le Jeu de la Guerre: Relevé des positions successives de toutes les forces au cours d'une partie] accessed January 14, 2008</ref>\u000a\u000aDebord was married twice, to [[Michèle Bernstein]] and [[Alice Becker-Ho]], however, these were open relationships. Debord had noted relationships with other women, including [[Michèle Mochot]], the daughter of a surrealist. Bernstein produced a vaguely fictional account of intimate details of the open relationships Mochot and she had with Debord in her novel, ''All The King's Horses''.\u000a\u000aDebord's alcohol consumption became problematic for his health, giving him a form of [[neuritis|polyneuritis]] brought on by his excessive drinking. Apparently, in order to end the suffering induced by this condition, he committed suicide,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jul/28/biography.artsandhumanities|title=Situation Abnormal|last=Hussey|first=Andrew|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 July 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2009 | location=London}}</ref> by shooting himself in the heart at his property in Champot, near [[Bellevue-la-Montagne]], [[Haute-Loire]], on November 30, 1994. Just before his death, he filmed (although did not publish) a documentary entitled, "Son art et son temps" (His Art and his Time), an "autobiography" that focused primarily on social issues in Paris in the 1990s. It has been suggested that this dark depiction of Debord's "time" was a suicide note of sorts.\u000a\u000aOn January 29, 2009, fifteen years after his death, [[Christine Albanel]], [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]], classified the archive of his works as a "[[national treasure]]" in response to a sale request by [[Yale University]].<ref>[http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-28060152.html juralibertaire.over-blog.com]</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/mar/18/guy-debord-situationist-international | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The resurrection of Guy Debord | first=Andrew | last=Gallix | date=March 18, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> The Ministry declared that "he has been one of the most important contemporary thinkers, with a capital place in history of ideas from the second half of the twentieth century."<ref>Journal Officiel de la Republique Francaise du 12 fevrier 2009 (texte 120)</ref> Similarly, Debord once called his book, ''The Society of the Spectacle'', "the most important book of the twentieth century".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} He continues to be a canonical and controversial figure particularly among European scholars of radical politics and modern art.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\u000a\u000a==Written works==\u000a{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\u000a{{Left communism sidebar |expanded=People}}\u000aGuy Debord's best known works are his theoretical books, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' and ''[[Comments on the Society of the Spectacle]]''. In addition to these he wrote a number of autobiographical books including ''Mémoires'', ''Panégyrique'', ''Cette Mauvaise Réputation...'', and ''Considérations sur l'assassinat de [[Gérard Lebovici]]''. He was also the author of numerous short pieces, sometimes anonymous, for the journals ''Potlatch'', ''Les Lèvres Nues'', ''Les Chats Sont Verts'', and ''Internationale Situationniste''.\u000a\u000aDebord was deeply distressed by the [[Cultural hegemony|hegemony]] of governments and media over everyday life through mass production and consumption. He criticized both the [[capitalism]] of the West and the dictatorial [[communism]] of the Eastern bloc for the lack of autonomy allowed to individuals by both types of governmental structure. Debord postulated that [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the 'spectacle' - "a social relation between people that is mediated by images" consisting of mass media, advertisement, and popular culture. The spectacle is a self-fulfilling control mechanism for society. Debord's analysis developed the notions of "[[reification (Marxism)|reification]]" and [[commodity fetishism|"fetishism of the commodity"]] pioneered by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Georg Lukács]]. Semiotics was also a major influence, particularly the work of his contemporary, Roland Barthes, who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle, and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle.<ref>Philippe Sollers "L'antifascisme de Barthes", Le Monde // Hors-Série Roland Barthes, Juillet-Août, 2015</ref> Debord's analysis of "the spectaclist society" probed the historical, economic, and psychological roots of the media and popular culture. Central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology: rather, it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization that has reached its climax in capitalism, as theorized by [[Herbert Marcuse]] of the [[Frankfurt School]]. \u000a{{Libertarian socialism |expanded=People}}\u000aThe Situationist International (SI), a political/artistic movement organized by Debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name, attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle. These strategies, including "[[dérive]]" and "[[détournement]]," drew on the traditions of [[Lettrism]]. As founder of the SI, it has been suggested that Debord felt driven to generalize and define the values, ideas, and characteristics of the entire group, which may have contributed to his hand-picking and expulsion of members. The hierarchical and dictatorial nature of the SI existed, however, in the groups that birthed it, including the Letterists and the Surrealists.\u000a\u000aDebord's first book, [[Mémoires]], was bound with a [[sandpaper]] cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it.\u000a\u000aDebord has been the subject of numerous biographies, works of fiction, artworks, and songs, many of which are catalogued in the bibliography by Shigenobu Gonzalves, "Guy Debord ou la Beauté du Negatif."\u000a\u000aOften, it is suggested that Debord was opposed to the creation of art, however, Debord writes in the Situationist International magazine ("Contre le Cinema") that he believes that "ordinary" (quotidian) people should make "everyday" (quotidian) art; art and creation should liberate from the spectacle, from capitalism, and from the banality of everyday life in contemporary society. In "The Society of the Spectacle," Debord argues that it is the price put on art that destroys the integrity of the art object, not the material or the creation itself. It is important to note that Debord does not equate art to "the spectacle."\u000a\u000a==Films==\u000a\u000aDebord began an interest in film early in his life when he lived in Cannes in the late 1940s. Debord recounted that, during his youth, he was allowed to do very little other than attend films. He said that he frequently would leave in the middle of a film screening to go home because films often bored him. Debord joined the Lettrists just as [[Isidore Isou]] was producing films and the Lettrists attempted to sabotage [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s trip to Paris through negative criticism. Debord directed his first film, ''Hurlements en faveur de Sade'' in 1952 with the voices of Michèle Bernstein and Gil Wolman. The film has no images represented; instead, it shows bright white when there is speaking and black when there is not. Long silences separate speaking parts. The film ends with 24 minutes of black silence. People were reported to have become angry and left screenings of this film. The script is composed of quotes appropriated from various sources and made into a montage with a sort of non-linear narrative. Later, through the financial support of Michèle Bernstein and Asger Jorn, Debord produced a second film, ''Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps'', which combined scenes with his friends and scenes from mass media culture. This integration of Debord's world with mass media culture became a running motif climaxing with "The Society of the Spectacle". Debord wrote the book ''The Society of the Spectacle'' before writing the movie. When asked why he made the book into a movie, Debord said, "I don't understand why this surprised people. The book was already written like a script". Debord's last film, "Son Art et Son Temps", was not produced during his lifetime. It worked as a final statement where Debord recounted his works and a cultural documentary of "his time".\u000a\u000a* ''Hurlements en faveur de Sade'' (Howls for Sade) 1952\u000a* ''Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps'' (On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time) 1959 (short film, Dansk-Fransk Experimentalfilmskompagni)\u000a* ''Critique de la séparation'' (Critique of Separation) 1961 (short film, Dansk-Fransk Experimentalfilmskompagni)\u000a* ''La Société du spectacle'' ([[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]) 1973 (Simar Films)\u000a* ''Réfutation de tous les judgements, tant élogieux qu\u2019hostiles, qui ont été jusqu\u2019ici portés sur le film « La Société du spectacle »'' (Refutation of All the Judgements, Pro or Con, Thus Far Rendered on the Film "The Society of the Spectacle") 1975 (short film, Simar Films)\u000a* ''{{Ill|fr|In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni}}'' (a Latin [[palindrome]] meaning "We Go Round and Round in the Night, Consumed by Fire") (Simar Films) 1978 - This film was meant to be Debord's last and is largely autobiographical.
