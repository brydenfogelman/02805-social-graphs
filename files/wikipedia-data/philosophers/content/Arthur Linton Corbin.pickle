Following graduation from Yale, he practiced law in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. Corbin returned to [[Yale Law School]] in 1903 to serve as an instructor in contract law.\u000a\u000a==Career at Yale==\u000aCorbin became a full professor at Yale Law School in 1909, a position he would hold until his retirement from teaching in 1943.<ref name="Yalecorbin"/>  During his time at Yale, he was strongly influential in turning the law school into the center of legal scholarship it is known for today.  He convinced the administration to hire more full-time professors and enact more selective admission criteria, and helped to implement and popularize the [[casebook method]] of legal study created by [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] at [[Harvard Law School]].\u000a\u000aHe was a founder of the [[American Law Institute]] and the first reporter of the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]].<ref name="Stephens"/>\u000a\u000a==Scholarship and writings==\u000aCorbin wrote extensively in the field of contract law.  His most famous work was the treatise ''Corbin on Contracts: A Comprehensive Treatise on the Working Rules of Contracts Law,'' the original version of which was eight volumes long and appeared in 1950 (though it has since been expanded).<ref name="jrank">[http://law.jrank.org/pages/5747/Corbin-Arthur-Linton.html Entry on Corbin from Thompson-Gale legal encyclopedia, courtesy of Jrank]</ref>  This treatise is still used today in [[Law school in the United States|American law schools]] and cited in [[law journals]] and [[judicial opinion]]s.<ref name="Yalecorbin"/>\u000a\u000aCorbin subscribed to the philosophy of [[legal realism]], the idea that law was the product of human efforts and society.  He believed that in resolving contract disputes, [[judge]]s should examine not just the "four corners" of the legal document itself, but the intention of the [[Party (law)|parties]], as evidenced by the [[course of dealing]] and [[course of performance]] between the parties, as well as the customs of the trade and business community.  Corbin felt that the main purpose of a contract was to protect the reasonable expectations of each party.\u000a\u000aCorbin's views are frequently contrasted with those of Harvard contracts scholar [[Samuel Williston]], who was more of a [[Legal formalism|formalist]] in his thinking.<ref name="Linzer">{{cite journal |first1=Peter |last1=Linzer |title=The Comfort of Certainty: Plain Meaning and the Parole Evidence Rule |volume=71 |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |page=799 |year=2002 |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol71/iss3/8 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>  Williston served as the reporter for the [[Restatement of the Law|First Restatement of Contracts]], but Corbin's contributions were more evident in the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]],<ref name="Yalecorbin"/> which he worked on until his retirement from legal study at age 90, due to failing eyesight.  Corbin died at age 92, in 1967.\u000a\u000aCorbin's scholarship heavily influenced the drafters of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], particularly the work of [[Karl N. Llewellyn|Karl Llewellyn]], who had previously studied under Corbin.\u000a\u000aHis portrait is in the Yale Law School collection.<ref name="Yalecorbin"/>\u000a\u000a==Works by Corbin==\u000a* {{cite journal |title=Bibliography of the Published Writings of Arthur Linton Corbin |volume=74 |journal=Yale Law Journal |page=311 |year=1964}}\u000a* {{cite book |last1=Corbin |first1=Arthur L. |first2=Joseph M. |last2=Perillo |title=Corbin on contracts |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |publisher=[[West Publishing|West Publishing Co]] |year=1993 |type=Print |isbn=0-327-00069-4}}\u000a* {{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Arthur L. |title=The Alumnus and the Law |volume=32 |journal=University of Kansas Law Review |page=763 |origyear=June 5, 1906, reprinted |date=1984 |location=[[University of Kansas]]}}\u000a* {{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Arthur L. |title=The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule |volume=50 |journal=[[Cornell Law Quarterly]] |publisher=[[Cornell Law School]] |page=161 |year=1965}}\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[Legal formalism]]\u000a\u000a==Notes==\u000a{{reflist|30em}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a*{{cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/cbl/3075.htm |title=Early Years, 1869-1916: Arthur L.
