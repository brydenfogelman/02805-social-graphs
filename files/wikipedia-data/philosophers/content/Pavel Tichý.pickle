V'''Pavel Tichý''' ({{IPA-cs|\u02c8pav\u025bl \u02c8c\u026axi\u02d0}}; 18 February 1936 [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovakia]] &ndash; 26 October 1994 [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[logician]],  [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]]. \u000aHe worked in the field of [[intensional logic]] and founded [[Transparent Intensional Logic]], an original theory of the logical analysis of natural languages \u2013 the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means. He spent roughly 25 years working on it. His main work is a book ''The Foundations of Frege's Logic'', published by [[Walter de Gruyter]] in 1988.\u000a\u000a==Early life and education==\u000aTichý was born in Brno in 1936. His father was an insurance clerk. His family lived in [[Zlín]] until 1948 when they moved to [[Vsetín]]. At school he was already a brilliant student. He also liked playing music of [[Jaroslav Je\u017eek (composer)|Jaroslav Je\u017eek]] on the piano. After finishing studies in Vsetin he moved to [[Prague]] followed by his parents. Tichý graduated in 1959 at [[Charles University]] in Prague. He stayed there tutoring as an assistant from 1961 to 1968 at the department of Logic at Faculty of Philosophy. One of his other hobbies was carpentry. He was said to be perfectionist in everything he did, whether he was learning a foreign language or making a table.\u000a\u000aIn 1968 he received an invitation from [[Exeter University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. He was permitted to leave the country even though it was shortly after Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia in the [[Prague Spring]]. He decided not to return. In 1970 he emigrated with his family to New Zealand, by ship. He started teaching at the [[University of Otago]] in Dunedin, New Zealand where he became Professor of Philosophy at Otago in 1981. Tichý stayed teaching there until his death. He is remembered as ferocious debater who liked to express his views directly regardless of any bad implications it could have. This made him a lot of friends but also a lot of enemies.\u000a\u000aFour years after the [[Velvet revolution]], in 1993, Tichý was offered the position of Head of the Department of Logic at the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts of [[Charles University in Prague]]. He planned to move to Prague in 1995 but committed suicide before taking up this position.{{Fact|date=December 2015}}\u000a\u000a===Degrees and academic appointment===\u000a*[[List of doctoral degrees awarded by country#Czech Republic|PhDr.]] ([[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]], 1959), thesis: ''Výklad Gödelovy v\u011bty o neúplnosti v prosté teorii typ\u016f'' [''An Exposition of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Incompleteness Theorem]] in the [[type theory|Simple Theory of Types]]''] \u000a*[[List of doctoral degrees awarded by country#Czech Republic|Candidate of Sciences]] (Charles University, 1964), thesis: ''Vy\u010díslitelnost ve vztahu k teoriím'' [''On Computability w.r.t.
