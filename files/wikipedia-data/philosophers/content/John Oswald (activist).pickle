He was born between 1755 and 1760 in [[Edinburgh]]. His father is said to have been a coffee-house-keeper, or a goldsmith.<ref name=RoyalHighlandRegiment>[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/scotreg/royal_highland.htm "Scottish Regiments: Royal Highland Regiment"] ''Scottish Military \u2013 Highland Regiments'', by William Melven, M.A., Glasgow</ref> He became a student goldsmith himself.<ref name=Jacobs>{{nl icon}} [http://www.athene.antenna.nl/ARCHIEF/NR03-Parijs/JACOBS%20-%20Oswald.htm "John Oswale: De Eerst Theoreticus Van De Directe Democratie?"] ("John Oswald: The First Theorist of Direct Democracy?"), by Roger Jacobs, ''Athene'', February 2003.</ref> It is said that Oswald learned [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] without a tutor, and later learned [[Arabic]].\u000a\u000a==Oswald in India==\u000a[[Image:Cry of Nature.jpg|right|thumb|Frontispiece of ''The Cry of Nature'', London, 1791. Caption reads: "The butcher's knife hath laid low the delight of a fond dam, & the darling of Nature is now stretched in gore upon the ground."]]\u000aOswald served in the [[British Army]] as a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Highland Regiment]], the forty-second regiment of foot.<ref name=RoyalHighlandRegiment/>  He served as a recruiting officer in Scotland during the [[American Revolution]], and then in 1780 to the [[Malabar Coast]] of [[India]].  Oswald's exposure to [[Hindu]] vegetarianism in India influenced his philosophy which he describes in ''The Cry of Nature or An Appeal to Mercy and Justice on Behalf of the Persecuted Animals'', published in 1791.<ref name=Jacobs/> This is considered an important work of western vegetarianism.<ref name=Vegetarian>[http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/olfahack/hist.htm "An Historical Perspective on Being Vegetarian."], by Indira Nathan, Frances Robinson, Lynne Burgess, and Allan Hackett, Centre for Consumer Education and Research, Liverpool John Moores University. Amended 20 January 2004</ref>\u000a\u000a==Return to Britain==\u000aOswald could no longer continue as an army officer. He left the army and returned to Britain in 1783, and began a period as an author of poetry and social criticism, and editor of ''The British Mercury'', a periodical publication.  During this period, Oswald wrote a sharp polemic in favour of [[republicanism]], ''Review of the Constitution of Great Britain'', and an anti-religious leaflet ''Ranae Comicae Evangelizantes: or the Comic Frogs turned Methodist'', in which he supported [[atheism]].<ref name=Jacobs/>\u000a\u000a==Oswald in France==\u000aWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Oswald travelled to Paris, and soon joined the [[Jacobin Club]].  In that body, he pressed for more energetic intervention by the Jacobins in British affairs, arguing that a revolution in England was essential for peace between the two nations.  An address to a [[Manchester]] radical organization was sent by the Jacobins on Oswald's urgings.  According to some reports, Oswald was sent to Ireland to offer French support for an Irish rebellion, but little appeared to come of this effort.\u000a\u000aIn March 1792, Oswald called for the universal arming of the masses, and began organizing a small army of [[sans-culottes]] in Paris known as the First Battalion of Pikers.  With the outbreak of [[Revolt in the Vendée|monarchist counter-revolution in La Vendée]], the First Battalion proceeded against the insurgents.  Oswald died in the battle of [[Les Ponts-de-Cé|Ponts-de-Cee]] on 14 September 1793.\u000a\u000a==''The Cry of Nature''==\u000aJohn Oswald, like his contemporary [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], argued that modern society was in conflict with man's nature.  Oswald argued in ''The Cry of Nature or an Appeal to Mercy and Justice on Behalf of the Persecuted Animals'', that man is naturally equipped with feelings of mercy and compassion. <ref name="pm"> [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], ''Nature's Web : An Exploration Of Ecological Thinking''. London : Simon & Schuster, 1992. ISBN 0671710656. (p. 255)</ref> If each man had to personally experience the death of the animals he ate, so argued Oswald, a vegetarian diet would be far more common. The division of labour, however, allows modern man to eat flesh without experiencing the prompting of man's natural sensitivities, while the brutalization of modern man made him inured to these sensitivities.<ref name="pm" /> Although Oswald gave compassion a central place in his philosophy, and was a vegetarian, he was not a pacifist, as evidenced by the fact that he died fighting in the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="pm" />\u000a\u000a==Works by John Oswald==\u000a* ''Review of the Constitution of Great Britain'', London 1784 (3rd ed.), Paris 1792\u000a* ''Ranae Comicae Evangelizantes: or the Comic Frogs turned Methodist'' (as Sylvester Otway), 1786\u000a* ''The Alarming Progress of French Politics'', 1787\u000a* ''Euphrosyne or an Ode to Beauty'', London, 1788\u000a* ''Poems, to which is added "The Humors of John Bull" an Operatic Farce'', London 1789 (published under the pseudonym Sylvester Otway)\u000a* ''[http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-timeline/animal-rights-o/osw-john-oswald/1791-cry-of-nature.htm#cry-of-nature The Cry of Nature, or An Appeal To Mercy and Justice On Behalf of the Persecuted Animals]'', 1791.
