V{{other people||Richard Weaver (disambiguation)}}\u000a[[File:Richard M Weaver.png|thumb|right|Richard M. Weaver]]\u000a'''Richard Malcolm Weaver, Jr''' (March 3, 1910 \u2013 April 1, 1963) was an [[United States|American]] scholar who taught [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  He is primarily known as an intellectual historian, political philosopher and a mid-20th century [[conservatism|conservative]] and as an authority on [[modern rhetoric]].  Weaver was briefly a [[socialist]] during his youth, a lapsed leftist intellectual (conservative by the time he was in graduate school), a teacher of [[composition (language)|composition]], a [[Plato]]nist philosopher, cultural [[critic]], and a theorist of human nature and society.  Described by biographer Fred Young as a "radical and original thinker,"<ref>Young 4</ref> Richard Weaver's books ''Ideas Have Consequences''  and ''The Ethics of Rhetoric'' remain influential among [[conservatism|conservative]] theorists and scholars of the [[Southern United States|American South]].  Weaver was also associated with the "New Conservatives," a group of scholars who in the 1940s and 1950s promoted [[traditionalist conservatism]].\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aWeaver was the eldest of four children born to a middle-class Southern family in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].  His father, Richard Sr., owned a livery stable. After the death of her husband during 1915, Carolyn Embry Weaver supported her children by working in her family's department store in her native [[Lexington, Kentucky]].  Lexington is the home of the [[University of Kentucky]] and of two private colleges.\u000a\u000aDespite his family's straitened circumstances after the death of his father, Richard Jr. attended a private boarding school and the [[University of Kentucky]]. He earned an A.B in English during 1932. The teacher at Kentucky who most influenced him was [[Francis Galloway]].  After a year of graduate study at Kentucky, Weaver began a master's degree in English at [[Vanderbilt University]]. [[John Crowe Ransom]] supervised his thesis, titled ''The Revolt against Humanism'', a critique of the [[humanism]] of [[Irving Babbitt]] and [[Paul Elmer More]].  Weaver then taught one year at [[Auburn University]] and three years at [[Texas A&M University]].\u000a\u000aDuring 1940, Weaver began a Ph.D. in English at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU), whose faculty included the rhetoricians and critics [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]], and the conservative political philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]]. While at LSU, Weaver spent summers studying at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Virginia]], and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. His Ph.D. was awarded during 1943 for a thesis, supervised first by [[Arlin Turner]] then by [[Cleanth Brooks]], titled ''The Confederate South, 1865-1910: A Study in the Survival of a Mind and a Culture''. It was published during 1968, posthumously, with the title ''The Southern Tradition at Bay''.\u000a\u000aAfter one year's teaching at [[North Carolina State University]], Weaver joined the English department at the [[University of Chicago]], where he spent the rest of his career,<ref>Young 3-4</ref> and where his exceptional teaching earned him that university's [[Quantrell Award]] during 1949. During 1957, Weaver published the first article in the inaugural issue of [[Russell Kirk]]'s ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]]''.\u000a\u000aWeaver spent his academic summers in a house he purchased in his ancestral [[Weaverville, North Carolina]], very near Asheville.  His widowed mother resided there year-round.  Weaver traveled between Chicago and Asheville by train.  To connect himself with traditional modes of agrarian life, he insisted that the family vegetable garden in Weaverville be plowed by mule. Every August the Weaver family had a reunion which Richard regularly attended and not infrequently addressed.\u000a\u000aPrecocious and bookish from a very young age, Weaver grew up to become "one of the most well-educated intellectuals of his era".<ref>Scotchie 4</ref> Highly self-sufficient and independent, he has been described as "solitary and remote",<ref>Young 1</ref> as a "shy little bulldog of a man".<ref>Nash 84</ref> Lacking close friends, and having few lifelong correspondents other than his Vanderbilt teacher and fellow Agrarian [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], Weaver was able to concentrate on his scholarly activities.\u000a\u000aDuring 1962, the [[Young Americans for Freedom]] gave Weaver an award for "service to education and the philosophy of a free society".<ref>Scotchie x</ref> Shortly before his sudden death in [[Chicago]], Weaver accepted an appointment at [[Vanderbilt University]]. According to his tombstone, Dr. Weaver died on April 3, 1963.  During 1964, the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]<ref>Nash 82</ref> created a [http://www.isi.org/programs/fellowships/richard_weaver.html graduate fellowship] in his memory. In 1983, the [[Rockford Institute]] established the annual [[Richard M. Weaver Award]] for Scholarly Letters.\u000a\u000a==Early influences==\u000aWeaver strongly believed in preserving and defending what he considered to be traditional Southern principles.<ref>Young 8</ref> These principles, such as [[anti-consumerism]] and [[chivalry]], were the basis of Weaver's teaching, writing, and speaking.\u000a\u000aHaving been raised with strong moral values, Weaver considered religion as the foundation for family and civilization.<ref>Young 21</ref> His appreciation for religion is evident in speeches he gave early while an undergraduate at the [[Young People's Society of Christian Endeavour|Christian Endeavour Society]], as well as in his later writings.<ref>Young 22</ref>\u000a\u000aInfluenced by his University of Kentucky professors, who were mostly of Midwestern origin and of social democratic inclinations, and by the crisis of the [[Great Depression]], Weaver believed that industrial [[capitalism]] had caused a general moral, economic, and intellectual failure in the [[United States]]. Hoping initially that [[socialism]] would afford an alternative to the prevailing [[industrialist]] culture,<ref>Young 3</ref> he joined the Kentucky chapter of the American Socialist Party. During 1932 Weaver actively campaigned for [[Norman Thomas]], the standard-bearer of that party. A few years later, he made a financial contribution to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Loyalist]] cause in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Encounters with intellectuals in coming years, such as [[Trillian (character)|Dr. Tricia McMillan]], would unsettle his early acceptance of socialism.\u000a\u000aWhile completing a thesis for a master's degree in English at [[Vanderbilt University]], Weaver discovered ideas related to the [[Southern Agrarians]] there.<ref>Young 69</ref> Gradually he began a rejection of socialism and embrace of tradition. He admired and sought to emulate its leader, the "doctor of culture" [[John Crowe Ransom]].<ref>Young 5</ref>\u000a\u000aThe Agrarians wrote passionately about the traditional values of community and the Old South. During 1930, a number of [[Vanderbilt University]] faculty and their students, led by Ransom, wrote an Agrarian manifesto, titled ''I'll Take My Stand''.<ref>Young 38</ref> Weaver agreed with the group's suspicion of the post-Civil War industrialization of the South.<ref>Young 47</ref> He found more congenial Agrarianism's focus on traditionalism and regional cultures than socialism's egalitarian "romanticizing" of the [[welfare state]].<ref>Scotchie 12</ref> Weaver abandoned socialism for Agrarianism only gradually over a number of years; the thinking of his 1934 M.A. thesis was not Agrarian.<ref>Young 58</ref>\u000a\u000a==Weaver's Old South==\u000a''The Southern Tradition at Bay'', the title under which Weaver's 1943 doctoral dissertation was published in 1968 after his death, surveyed the post-[[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] literature of the states that were part of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. He revealed what he considered its continuities with the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era (1781\u20131860)|antebellum era]]. Weaver also discussed certain Southerners who dissented from this tradition, such as [[Walter Hines Page]], [[George Washington Cable]], and [[Henry W. Grady]], whom he termed "Southern liberals."\u000a\u000aWeaver identified four traditional Southern characteristics: "a [[feudalism|feudal]] theory of society, a code of [[chivalry]], the ancient concept of the gentleman, and a noncreedal faith".<ref>Young 78</ref> According to him, the Southern feudal system was centered on the legitimate pride a family line derived from linking its name to a piece of land.<ref>Young 81</ref> For Weaver, land ownership gave the individual a much needed "stability, responsibility, dignity, and sentiment".<ref>Scotchie 25</ref>\u000a\u000aYet in his ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'', he downplayed the materialistic notion of ownership.  He asserted that private property was "the last metaphysical right" of the individual.<ref>Nash 100</ref> Southern chivalry and gentlemen's behavior, on the other hand, emphasized a paternalistic personal honor, and [[etiquette|decorum]] over competition and cleverness.<ref>Young 83</ref> Weaver claimed that women preferred the romanticized soldier to the materialistic businessman.<ref>Scotchie 36</ref>\u000a\u000aThe noncreedal faith Weaver advocated (he was a non-practicing [[Protestantism|Protestant]]) grew out of what he termed the South's "older religiousness".<ref>Young 84</ref> This "religion" emphasized a respect for tradition and nature, and for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]/[[Anglican Communion|Episcopal]] church,<ref>Young 84-85</ref> the established church in Virginia and south during the colonial era. Weaver agreed with the traditional Christian notion that external science and technology could not save man, born a sinner in need of redemption.<ref>Scotchie 21</ref>\u000a\u000aWeaver believed that the South was the "last non-materialist civilization in the Western World".<ref>Scotchie 17</ref> Weaver came to advocate a revival of Southern traditions as the only cure for a commodity-based capitalism. He believed it was a way to combat the social degradation he witnessed while living in Chicago.\u000a\u000aWeaver's ancestral region, [[Asheville, North Carolina]], was not typical of the American South whose virtues he came to revere and extol. It is instead part of the [[Appalachia]]n upland, settled mainly by persons of [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry and evangelical Presbyterian affiliation. Slavery was almost unknown there, because the soil and climate were not suited to cotton or any other plantation agriculture. Instead, the main economic activity was subsistence farming on small [[Fee simple|freeholds]], with many families living in serious poverty. North Carolina's decision to secede from the Union during 1861 was far from unanimous, and many Appalachian men refused to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the Civil War. The westernmost [[Congressional district]] of North Carolina, which includes Asheville, has mostly voted Republican since the Civil War.\u000a\u000a==The beginnings of a theory==\u000aWeaver gradually came to see himself as the "cultural doctor of the South," despite making his career in Chicago.<ref>Young 5</ref> More specifically, he sought to resist what he saw as America's growing [[barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]] by teaching his students of the correct way to write, use, and understand language, teaching that connected Weaver with Platonist ideals. Following the tradition of the Socratic dialogues, Weaver taught that misuse of language caused social corruption. That belief led him to criticize [[jazz]] as a medium that promoted "barbaric impulses" because he perceived the idiom as lacking form and rules.<ref>Scotchie 46</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Groothuis|first=Douglas|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/jazz-and-politics-by-douglas-groothuis.php?pg=1&width=1024|title=Jazz and Politics|publisher=All About Jazz|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>\u000a\u000aWeaver's study of American literature emphasized the past, such as the nineteenth century culture of New England and the South, and the [[Lincoln-Douglas debate]]s.<ref>Young 6</ref> Attempting to truly understand language, Weaver concentrated on a culture's fundamental beliefs; that is, beliefs that strengthened and educated citizens into a course of action.<ref>Young 9</ref> By teaching and studying language, he endeavored to generate a healthier culture that would no longer use language as a tool of lies and persuasion in a "prostitution of words".<ref>Young 9</ref> Moreover, in a capitalist society, applied science was the "sterile opposite" of what he saw as redemption \u2013 the "poetic and ethical vision of life".<ref>Young 62</ref>\u000a\u000aWeaver condemned modern media and modern journalism as tools for exploiting the passive viewer. Convinced that ideas, not machines, compelled humanity towards a better future, he gave words precedence over technology.<ref>Nash 96</ref> Influenced by the Agrarians' emphasis of poetry, he began writing poetry.<ref>Young 76</ref> In a civilized society, poetry allowed one to express personal beliefs that science and technology could not overrule. In Weaver's words, "We can will our world".<ref>Nash 97</ref> That is, human beings \u2013 not mechanical or social forces \u2013 can make positive decisions through language that will change their existence.\u000a\u000a==Communitarian individualism==\u000aIn a short speech delivered to the 1950 reunion of the Weaver clan, Weaver criticized urban life in Chicago as follows: "the more closely people are crowded together, the less they know one another".<ref>''Address'' 114</ref> In a comparative study of [[John Randolph of Roanoke|Randolph of Roanoke]] and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], Weaver defined  "individualism" in two ways: 1) "studied withdrawal from society" (i.e. Thoreau) and 2) "political action at the social level" (i.e. Randolph).<ref>Young 11</ref> Thoreau (according to Weaver) rejected society while Randolph embraced social bonds through politics.\u000a\u000aPersonally opposed to America's centralized political power, Weaver, like Randolph, preferred an individualism that included community.<ref>Young 12</ref> "Community" here refers to a shared identity of values tied to a geographical and spatial location \u2013 in Weaver's case, the Old South. He concluded that individualism that is founded on community enabled a citizen "to know who he was and what he was about".<ref>Young 12</ref> Without this intimate foundation, citizens seeking individualism would be unable to reach a true, personal identity. More importantly, he believed that people should grant priority to a living community and its well-being, not to individual fulfillment.<ref>Scotchie 3</ref>\u000a\u000a==Anti-nominalism==\u000aIn ''Ideas Have Consequences'', Weaver analyzed [[William of Ockham|William of Occam's]] 14th century notions of nominalist philosophy. In broad terms, nominalism is the idea that "[[universalism|universals]] are not real, only particulars".<ref>Young 107</ref> Nominalism deprives people of a measure of universal truth, so that each man becomes his own "priest and ethics professor".<ref>Scotchie 5</ref> Weaver deplored this [[relativism]], and believed that modern men were "moral idiots, ... incapable of distinguishing between better and worse".<ref>Nash 89</ref>\u000a\u000aWeaver viewed America's moral degradation and turn toward commodity-culture as the unwitting consequences of its belief in nominalism. That is, a civilization that no longer believed in universal [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental values]] had no moral ambition to understand a higher truth outside of man.<ref>Nash 89</ref> The result was a "shattered world",<ref>Young 113</ref> in which truth was unattainable, and freedom only an illusion. Moreover, without a focus on the sort of higher truth that can be found in organized religions, people turned to the more tangible idols of science and [[economic materialism|materialism]].\u000a\u000aWeaver's ideal society was that of the European [[Middle Ages]], when the [[Roman Catholic Church]] gave to all an accurate picture of reality and truth.<ref>Nash 94</ref> Nominalism emerged in the late Middle Ages and quickly came to dominate Western thinking. More generally, Weaver felt that the shift from universal truth and transcendental order to individual opinion and industrialism adversely affected the moral health of Americans.\u000a\u000aNominalism also undermines the concept of [[hierarchy]], which depends entirely on fundamental truths about people. Weaver, in contrast, believed that hierarchies are necessary. He argued that social, gender, and age-related equality actually undermine stability and order. Believing in "natural social groupings".<ref>Young 112</ref> he claimed that it should be possible to sort people into suitable categories without the envy of equality. Using the hierarchical structure of a family as an example, he thought that family members accept various duties grounded in "sentiment" and "fraternity," not equality and rights.<ref>Young 113</ref> Continuing in this direction, he claimed not to understand the [[feminist movement]], which led women to abandon their stronger connection to nature and intuition for a superficial political and economic equality with men.<ref>Young 123</ref>\u000a\u000aWeaver maintained that egalitarianism only promoted "[s]uspicion, hostility, and lack of trust and loyalty".<ref>Toledano 270</ref> Instead, he believed that there must be a center, a transcendent truth on which people could focus and structure their lives. Contrary to what nominalism would suggest, language can be pinned down, can serve as a foundation through which one can "find real meaning".<ref>Young 122</ref> So, those who do not understand language can never find real meaning, which is inordinately tragic. In Weaver's words, "a world without generalization would be a world without knowledge".<ref>Young 114</ref> Thus universals allow true knowledge.\u000a\u000a==Weaver on rhetoric==\u000aIn ''The Ethics of Rhetoric'', Weaver evaluates the ability of rhetoric to persuade. Similarly to [[ancient philosophy|ancient philosophers]], Weaver found that language has the power to move people to do good, to do evil, or to do nothing at all.<ref>Young 129</ref> In his defense of orthodoxy, Weaver set down a number of rhetorical principles. He grounded his definition of "noble rhetoric" in the work of [[Plato]]; such rhetoric aimed to improve intellect by presenting men with "better versions of themselves".<ref>Young 135</ref> He also agreed with Plato's notions of the realities of transcendentals (recall Weaver's hostility to nominalism) and the connection between form and substance.<ref>Johannesen 7</ref> For instance, Weaver admired the connection between the forms of poetry and rhetoric. Like poetry, rhetoric relies on the [[connotation]] of words as well as their [[denotation]]. Good rhetoricians, he asserted, use poetic [[analogy|analogies]] to relate [[abstraction|abstract]] ideas directly to the listeners.<ref>Young 132</ref> Specifically emphasizing [[metaphor]], he found that comparison should be an essential part of the rhetorical process.<ref>Johannesen 23</ref> However, arguments from definition\u2014that is, from the very nature of things (justice, beauty, the nature of man) -- had an even higher ethical status, because they were grounded in essences rather than similarities. Arguments grounded in mere circumstance ("I have to quit school because I cannot afford the tuition") Weaver viewed as the least ethical, because they grant the immediate facts a higher status than principle. Finally, Weaver pointed out that arguments from authority are only as good as the authority itself.<ref>Johannesen 27</ref>\u000a\u000aIn ''Language is Sermonic'', Weaver pointed to rhetoric as a presentation of values. Sermonic language seeks to persuade the listener, and is inherent in all communication. Indeed, the very choice to present arguments from definition instead of from consequence implies that one of the modes of reason carries greater value. He also considered rhetoric and the multiplicity of man. That is, he acknowledged that logic alone was not enough to persuade man, who is "a pathetic being, that is, a being feeling and suffering".<ref>Weaver 1352</ref> He felt that societies that placed great value on technology often became dehumanized. Like a machine relying purely on logic, the rhetorician was in danger of becoming "a thinking robot".<ref>Weaver 1353</ref>\u000a\u000aWeaver divided the nature of man into four categories: rational, emotional, ethical, and religious.<ref>Johannesen 13</ref> Without considering these characteristics as a whole, rhetoricians cannot hope to persuade their listeners. Moreover, when motivating the listener to adopt attitudes and actions, rhetoricians must consider the uniqueness of each audience.<ref>(Weaver 1351</ref> In other words, orators should acknowledge that each audience has different needs and responses, and must formulate their arguments accordingly. Weaver also divided "argumentation" into four categories: [[Causality|cause-effect]], [[definition]], [[consequentialism|consequences]], and [[communities of circumstance|circumstances]].<ref>Johannesen 27</ref> The rhetorician must decide which method of argument will best persuade a given audience.\u000a\u000aIn his ''The Ethics of Rhetoric'', Weaver coined the phrases "god terms" and "devil terms".<ref>Young 147-49</ref> "God terms" are words particular to a certain age and are vague, but have "inherent potency" in their meanings.<ref>Young 147</ref> Such words include [[wikt:progress|progress]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] \u2013 words that seem impenetrable and automatically give a phrase positive meaning. In contrast, "devil terms" are the mirror image, and include words such as [[Communist]] and [[Un-American]].<ref>Weaver 222-23</ref> Rhetoric, Weaver argued, must employ such terminology only with care. Employing ethical rhetoric is the first step towards rejecting vague terminology with propagandistic value.<ref>Johannesen 27</ref> Upon hearing a "god" or "devil" term, Weaver suggested that a listener should "hold a dialectic with himself" to consider the intention behind such persuasive words.<ref>Weaver 232</ref> He concluded that "a society's health or declension was mirrored in how it used language".<ref>Young 151</ref> If a language is pure, so too will be those who employ it.\u000a\u000a==Weaver's influence==\u000aSome regard ''The Southern Tradition at Bay'' as Weaver's best work.  ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' is more widely known, thanks to its substantial influence on the "postwar intellectual [[Right-wing politics|Right]]".<ref>Nash 87</ref> The leading young conservative intellectuals of the era, including [[Russell Kirk]], [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], and [[Willmoore Kendall]], praised the book for its critical insights.<ref>Young 179</ref> Publisher Henry Regnery claims that the book gave the modern conservative movement a strong intellectual foundation.<ref>Nash 82</ref> [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank S. Meyer]], a  [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] theorist of the 1960s \u2013 and former Communist Party USA member \u2013 publicly thanked Weaver for inspiring him to join the Right.<ref>Nash 88</ref>\u000a\u000aFor many liberals, Weaver was a misguided authoritarian. For many conservatives, he was a champion of tradition and liberty, with the emphasis on [[tradition]]. For Southerners, he was a refreshing defender of an "antimodern" South.<ref>Nash 108</ref> For others he was a historical revisionist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/138254/article-1G1-135580976/richard-weaver-untraditional-case-federalism|author=Bailey, Jeremy David|title=Richard Weaver's untraditional case for federalism.|publisher=Publius|date=September 22, 2004|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref> His refutation of what Russell Kirk termed "ritualistic [[liberalism]]"<ref>Nash 87</ref> struck a chord with conservative intellectuals. Stemming from a tradition of "[[cultural pessimism]]",<ref>Nash 92</ref> his critique of nominalism, however startling, gave conservatives a new philosophical direction. His writing attacked the growing number of modern Americans denying conservative structure and moral uprightness, confronting them with [[empirical evidence|empirical]] [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]. During the 1980s, the emerging [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]] adapted his vision of the Old South to express [[antimodernism]].<ref>Nash 109</ref> Weaver has come to be seen as defining America's plight and as inspiring conservatives to find "the relationship between faith and reason for an age that does not know the meaning of faith".<ref>Toledano 259</ref>\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a{{portal|conservatism}}\u000a*  [[agrarianism]]\u000a*  [[Neo-Confederate]]\u000a*  [[nominalism]]\u000a*  [[paleo-conservatism]]\u000a*  [[rhetoric]]\u000a*  [[traditionalist conservatism]]\u000a*  [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934)\u000a*  [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]] (1893-1968)\u000a*  [[Russell Kirk]] (1918-1994)\u000a*  [[John Crowe Ransom]] (1888-1974)\u000a*  [[Leo Strauss]] (1899-1973)\u000a*  [[Eric Voegelin]] (1901-1985)\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a\u000a===Books by Weaver===\u000aBooks in bold are still in print.\u000a* 1948.
