A year later he was abruptly released from the prison hospital, and sentenced to five years exile in the Kazakh town of Karaganda as a "socially dangerous element." In Karagada, he found employment as a teacher of evening and correspondence courses in mathematics. \u000a\u000aIn 1953, after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Volpin was released due to a general amnesty.

The leaflets written by Volpin and distributed through [[samizdat]] asserted that the accusations and their closed-door trial were in violation of the 1936 Soviet Constitution and the more recent RSFSR Criminal Procedural Code. \u000a\u000aThe meeting was attended by about 200 people, many of whom turned out to be [[KGB]] operatives.

He proclaimed that it is possible and necessary to defend human rights by strictly observing the law, and in turn demand that the authorities observe the formally guaranteed rights.

Here this \u2026 is totally innocent, in that it can be easily be replaced by 100 items (names) separated by commas. I raised just this objection with the (extreme) ultrafinitist Yessenin-Volpin during a lecture of his. He asked me to be more specific. I then proceeded to start with 2<sup>1</sup> and asked him whether this is \u201creal\u201d or something to that effect. He virtually immediately said yes. Then I asked about 2<sup>2</sup>, and he again said yes, but with a perceptible delay. Then 2<sup>3</sup>, and yes, but with more delay. This continued for a couple of more times, till it was obvious how he was handling this objection. Sure, he was prepared to always answer yes, but he was going to take 2<sup>100</sup> times as long to answer yes to 2<sup>100</sup> then he would to answering 2<sup>1</sup>.
