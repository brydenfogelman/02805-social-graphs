John Stuart was educated by his father, with the advice and assistance of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Francis Place]]. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing, and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father, a follower of Bentham and an adherent of [[associationism]], had as his explicit aim to create a [[genius]] intellect that would carry on the cause of\u000a[[utilitarianism]] and its implementation after he and Bentham had died.<ref>{{cite book|last=Halevy|first=Elie|title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism|year=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-19-101020-0|pages=282\u2013284}}</ref>\u000a\u000aMill was a notably precocious child.

His main reading was still history, but he went through all the commonly taught [[Latin literature|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and [[Demosthenes]] with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of Mill's earliest poetry compositions was a continuation of the [[Iliad]]. In his spare time, he also enjoyed reading about [[natural science]]s and popular novels, such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.\u000a\u000aHis father's work, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published in 1818; immediately thereafter, about the age of twelve, Mill began a thorough study of the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[logic]], at the same time reading [[Aristotle]]'s logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to [[political economy]] and studied [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] with his father, ultimately completing their [[Classical economics|classical economic view]] of [[factors of production]]. Mill's ''comptes rendus'' of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing ''Elements of Political Economy'' in 1821, a textbook to promote the ideas of [[Ricardian economics]]; however, the book lacked popular support.<ref name="Rothbard2006">{{cite book|author=Murray N.

The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In [[Montpellier]], he attended the winter courses on [[chemistry]], [[zoology]], [[logic]] of the ''Faculté des Sciences'', as well as taking a course of the higher mathematics. While coming and going from France, he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], a friend of Mill's father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party, as well as other notable Parisians, including [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]].\u000a\u000aMill went through months of sadness and pondered suicide at twenty years of age.  According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V, of his autobiography, he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society, his life's objective, would actually make him happy.  His heart answered "no" and unsurprisingly, he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective.  Eventually, the poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] showed him beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy. [http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/crisis.html]  With renewed joy, he continued to work towards a just society, but with more relish for the journey.  He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking.  In fact, many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy.\u000a\u000aMill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[positivism]] and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte's ''sociologie'' was more an early [[philosophy of science]] than we perhaps know it today, and the ''positive'' philosophy aided in Mill's broad rejection of Benthamism.<ref>Pickering, Mary (1993), ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 540</ref>\u000a\u000aAs a [[nonconformist]] who refused to subscribe to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], Mill was not eligible to study at the [[University of Oxford]] or the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name="bio">Capaldi, Nicholas.

Taylor was married when they met, and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died. Brilliant in her own right, Taylor was a significant influence on Mill's work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Harriet Taylor reinforced Mill's advocacy of [[women's rights]]. He cites her influence in his final revision of ''[[On Liberty]]'', which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe [[lung congestion]], after only seven years of marriage to Mill.\u000a\u000aBetween the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as [[Lord Rector]] of the [[University of St. Andrews]].

During his time as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland.

Mill became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]'', Mill called for various reforms of Parliament and voting, especially [[proportional representation]], the [[Single Transferable Vote]], and the extension of [[suffrage]]. In April 1868, Mill favoured in a Commons debate the retention of [[capital punishment]] for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition "an effeminacy in the general mind of the country."<ref>John Stuart Mill: ''Utilitarianism and the 1868 Speech on Capital Punishment''.

[[William Whewell]] expanded on this in his 1837 ''History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time'' followed in 1840 by ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon their History'', presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths, which could be known without need for empirical verification. Mill countered this in 1843 in ''[[A System of Logic|A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive]], Being a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence, and the Methods of Scientific Investigation.'' In [[Mill's Methods]] of induction, like Herschel's, laws were discovered through observation and induction, and required empirical verification.<ref name="Shermer2002">{{cite book|first= Michael| last= Shermer |authorlink=Michael Shermer|title=In Darwin's Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eu9Uu3PbdcgC&pg=PP212|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-992385-4|page=212}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Theory of liberty===\u000a{{Main article|On Liberty}}\u000aMill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' addresses the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]]. However Mill is clear that his concern for liberty does not extend to all individuals and all societies. He states that "Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians".<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm ''On Liberty'', by John Stuart Mill, pp. 18\u201319.]</ref>\u000a\u000aMill states that it is acceptable to harm oneself as long as the person doing so is not harming others. He also argues that individuals should be prevented from doing lasting, serious harm to themselves or their property by the [[harm principle]]. Because no one exists in isolation, harm done to oneself may also harm others, and destroying property deprives the community as well as oneself.<ref>Mill, John Stuart "On Liberty" Penguin Classics, 2006 ISBN 978-0-14-144147-4 pages 90\u201391</ref> Mill excuses those who are "incapable of [[self-government]]" from this principle, such as young children or those living in "backward states of society".\u000a\u000aThough this principle seems clear, there are a number of complications. For example, Mill explicitly states that "harms" may include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus, failing to rescue a [[drowning]] child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay [[taxes]], or failing to appear as a [[witness]] in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill. By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if \u2013 without force or fraud \u2013 the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved. (Mill does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to [[Voluntary slavery|sell themselves into slavery]]). In these and other cases, it is important to bear in mind that the arguments in ''On Liberty'' are grounded on the principle of Utility, and not on appeals to [[natural rights]].\u000a\u000aThe question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. It is important to emphasise that Mill did not consider giving offence to constitute "harm"; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society.\u000a\u000a''[[On Liberty]]'' involves an impassioned defense of free speech. Mill argues that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere [[dogma]]. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one.  Along those same lines Mill wrote, "unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them."<ref>Mill, John Stuart, On Liberty, Harvard Classics: Volume 25, p 258, PF Collier & Sons Company New York 1909</ref>\u000a[[File:J S Mill and H Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|John Stuart Mill and [[Helen Taylor (feminist)|Helen Taylor]]. Helen was the daughter of Harriet Taylor and collaborated with Mill for fifteen years after her mother's death in 1858.]]\u000a\u000a====Social liberty and tyranny of majority====\u000a{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\u000aMill believed that "the struggle between [[Liberty]] and [[Authority]] is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history." For him, liberty in antiquity was a "contest... between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government." Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers." He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and [[tyranny of the majority]].\u000a\u000a[[Social liberty]] for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler's power so that he would not be able to use his power on his own wishes and make decisions which could harm society; in other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government's decisions. He said that [[social liberty]] was "the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual". It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights; second, by establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".\u000a\u000aHowever, in Mill's view, limiting the power of government was not enough. He stated, "Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself."<ref>Mill, John Stuart "On Liberty" Penguin Classics, 2006 ISBN 978-0-14-144147-4 pp. 10\u201311</ref>\u000a\u000a====Liberty====\u000aJohn Stuart Mill's view on [[liberty]], which was influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], is that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right...The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him, his independence is, of right, [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the [[individual]] is [[sovereign]].<ref>John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), " (Mill, On Liberty, p.13).[http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=harp;cc=harp;rgn=full%20text;idno=harp0024-5;didno=harp0024-5;view=image;seq=00693;node=harp0024-5%3A1 Cornell.edu]</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aMill added: "Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion."<ref>[http://www.antiwar.com/stromberg/s051802.html "John Stuart Mill and Liberal Imperialism"] Retrieved 11 June 2013.</ref>\u000a\u000a====Freedom of speech====\u000aAn influential advocate of [[freedom of speech]], Mill objected to censorship. He says:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>I choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me \u2013 In which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of [[utility]], is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of [[infallibility]]. It is the undertaking to decide that question ''for others'', without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However, positive anyone's persuasion may be, not only of the faculty but of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of opinion. \u2013 yet if, in pursuance of that private judgement, though backed by the public judgement of his country or contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal.<ref>John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) "On Liberty" 1859. ed. Gertrude Himmelfarb, UK: Penguin, 1985, pp. 83\u201384</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aMill outlines the benefits of 'searching for and discovering the truth' as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false, he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions.<ref name="Freedomof">Freedom of Speech, Volume 21, by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Dycus Miller, Jeffrey Paul</ref> Worried about minority views being suppressed, Mill also argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds, stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have in order to empower debate over public policy.<ref name="Freedomof" /> Mill also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a person's potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that eccentricity was preferable to uniformity and stagnation.<ref name="Freedomof" />\u000a\u000a====Harm Principle====\u000a\u000aThe belief that the freedom of speech will advance the society was formed with trust of the public\u2019s ability to filter. If any argument is really wrong or harmful, the public will judge it as wrong or harmful, and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government shouldn\u2019t be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him, if rebellion is really necessary, people should rebel; if murder is truly proper, it should be allowed. But, the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing, not in a way that causes actual harm to others. This is the Harm Principle.\u000a\u000aFor example, if an influential politician points at a woman with a headscarf in front of an excited crowd of people and says she is part of ISIS, that is wrong, since it will cause clear danger to the woman who was pointed out. Mill says:\u000a\u000a<blockquote> That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\u201d <ref>John Stuart Mill. (1863). On Liberty. Ticknor and Fields. pp. 23</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of \u201cclear and present danger\u201d   based on Mill\u2019s idea. In the majority opinion, Holmes writes:\u000a\u000a<blockquote> The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.<ref>Schenck v.

Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence.<ref name="The Subjection of Women">Mill, J.S.

This philosophy has a long tradition, although Mill's account is primarily influenced by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and Mill's father [[James Mill]].\u000a\u000aJeremy Bentham's famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the "greatest-happiness principle". It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason. Mill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (lower pleasures). Mill distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that "it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question."<ref name="John Stuart Mill">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm#CHAPTER_II Mill, John Stuart, Utilitarianism (Project Gutenberg online edition)]</ref>\u000a\u000aMill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is, perhaps, in direct contrast with Bentham's statement that "Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry",<ref name="Bronfenbrenner">[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.1977.tb00452.x/abstract Poetry, push pin and utility]</ref> that, if a simple child's game like [[hopscotch]] causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house, it is more imperative upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mill's argument is that the "simple pleasures" tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to [[Informed judge|judge]]. Mill also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practice philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agent's own greatest happiness that matters "but the greatest amount of happiness altogether".<ref name=Mill >{{Harvnb|Mill|1906|p=16}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThe qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in ''On Liberty''. As Mill suggests in that text, utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity "as a progressive being", which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a "higher mode of existence". The rejection of censorship and [[paternalism]] is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities.\u000a\u000a===Economic philosophy===\u000a{{Main article|Principles of Political Economy}}\u000a[[File:Mill - Essays on economics and society, 1967 - 5499347.tif|thumb|''Essays on economics and society'', 1967]]\u000aMill's early [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] was one of [[free market]]s.

He concluded that a stationary state could be preferable to unending economic growth:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>I cannot, therefore, regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school.</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it.</blockquote>\u000a\u000a====Economic development====\u000a{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\u000aMill regarded economic development as a function of land, labour and capital. While land and labour are the two original factors of production, capital is "a stock, previously accumulated of the products of former labour." Increase in wealth is possible only if land and capital help to increase production faster than the labour force. It is productive labour that is productive of wealth and capital accumulation. "The rate of capital accumulation is the function of the proportion of the labour force employed productively. Profits earned by employing unproductive labours are merely transfers of income; unproductive labour does not generate wealth or income". It is productive labourers who do productive consumption. Productive consumption is that "which maintains and increase the productive capacity of the community." It implies that productive consumption is an input necessary to maintain productive labourers.<ref>''John Stuart Mill's Social and Political Thought: Critical Assessments'', by John Stuart Mill</ref>\u000a\u000a====Control of population growth====\u000a{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\u000aMill supported the [[Malthusian]] theory of population. By population he meant the number of the working class only. He was therefore concerned about the growth in number of labourers who worked for hire. He believed that population control was essential for improving the condition of the working class so that they might enjoy the fruits of the technological progress and capital accumulation. Mill advocated birth control. In 1823 Mill and a friend were arrested while distributing pamphlets on birth control by Francis Place to women in working class areas.<ref name="Capaldi2004">{{cite book|author=Nicholas Capaldi|title=John Stuart Mill: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SxydLpuVC4C|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=12 January 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44920-5|page=41}}</ref>\u000a\u000a====Wage fund====\u000a{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\u000aAccording to Mill, supply is very elastic in response to wages. Wages generally exceed the minimum subsistence level, and are paid out of capital. Hence, wages are limited by existing capital for paying wages. Thus, wage per worker can be derived by dividing the total circulating capital by the size of the working population. Wages can increase by an increase in the capital used in paying wages, or by decrease in the number of workers. If wages rise, supply of labour will rise. Competition among workers not only brings down wages, but also keeps some workers out of employment. This is based on Mill's notion that "demand for commodities is not demand for labourers". It means that income invested as advances of wages to labour creates employment, and not income spent on consumer goods. An increase in consumption causes a decline in investment. So increased investment leads to increases in the wage fund and to economic progress.\u000a\u000aIn 1869, Mill recanted his support of the Wage-Fund Doctrine due to recognition that capital is not necessarily fixed in that it can be supplemented through "income of the employer which might otherwise go into savings or be spent on consumption." (Spiegel,{{who|date=November 2015}} p.&nbsp;390) Walker{{who|date=November 2015}} also states in "The Wages Question" that the limits on capital and the growth in population "were accidental, not essential" to the formation of the doctrine. The limitation on the growth of industrial capacity placed a limit on the number of workers who could be accommodated more than the limit on capital. Furthermore, English agriculture "had reached the condition of diminishing returns." (Walker); therefore, each additional worker was not providing more output than he needed for himself for survival. Given the improvements in technology and productivity that followed 1848, the original reasons that gave rise to the doctrine were seen to be unusual and not the basis for a universal law.\u000a\u000a====Rate of capital accumulation====\u000a{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\u000aAccording to Mill, the rate of capital accumulation depends on: (1) "the amount of fund from which saving can be made" or "the size of the net produce of the industry", and (2) the "disposition to save". Capital is the result of savings, and the savings come from the "abstinence from present consumption for the sake of future goods". Although capital is the result of saving, it is nevertheless consumed. This means saving is spending. Since saving depends on the net produce of the industry, it grows with profits and rent which go into making the net produce. On the other hand, the disposition to save depends on (1) the rate of profit and (2) the desire to save, or what Mill called "effective desire of accumulation". However, profit also depends on the cost of labour, and the rate of profit is the ratio of profits to wages. When profits rise or wages fall, the rate of profits increases, which in turn increases the rate of capital accumulation.
