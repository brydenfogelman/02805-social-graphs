When he returned home, he set up two [[pendulum]]s of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together.

Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality.

This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his ''Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems'' the ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), p. 354, n. 52</ref> The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.\u000a\u000aFor Galileo, the [[tide]]s were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 119\u2013133</ref> His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the [[Adriatic Sea]] compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.\u000a\u000aIf this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at [[Venice]] instead of one, about twelve hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 127\u2013131 and Galilei, ([[#CITEREFGalilei1953|1953]]), pp. 432\u20136</ref> Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments, [[Albert Einstein]] expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his "fascinating arguments" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth.<ref>Einstein (1953) p. xvii</ref> Galileo dismissed the idea, held by his contemporary [[Johannes Kepler]], that the moon caused the tides.<ref>Galilei, ([[#CITEREFGalilei1953|1953]]), p.&nbsp;462.</ref> (Galileo also took no interest in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets.)<ref>James Robert Voelkel.

Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.<ref name="Graney and Danielson, 2014">Graney and Danielson ([[#CITEREFGraneyDanielson2014|2014]]).</ref>\u000a\u000aReligious opposition to heliocentrism arose from Biblical references such as [[Psalms|Psalm]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Psalm|93:1|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|96:10|KJV}}, and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|16:30|KJV}} which include text stating that "the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved."

In December 1613 the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, [[Benedetto Castelli]], with biblical objections to the motion of the earth.  According to Maurice Finocchiaro this was done in a friendly and gracious manner, out of curiosity. Prompted by this incident, Galileo wrote a letter to Castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts, and that the bible was an authority on faith and morals, not on science.  This letter was not published, but circulated widely.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 27-28.</ref>\u000a\u000aBy 1615 Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the [[Roman Inquisition]] by Father Niccolo Lorini, who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible, which was seen as a violation of the [[Council of Trent]] and looked dangerously like Protestantism.<ref name= "Langford 1992, p.56-57">Langford (1992), pp. 56\u201357</ref> Lorini specifically cited Galileo's letter to Castelli.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 28 & 134.</ref>  Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his Copernican and biblical ideas. At the start of 1616, Monsignor Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed.<ref>[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 68-69)]] Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015.</ref>  According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the "chief direct basis" for the Inquisition's actions.<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2010|Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72)]]</ref> The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned Brahe's argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself."<ref>[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 71)]]</ref>  The essay also included four theological arguments, but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments, and he did not mention Galileo's biblical ideas.<ref>[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 66-76, 164-175, 187-195)]]</ref> In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture."

He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo [[Barberini]] as [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the [[Inquisition]] and papal permission.<ref name = "Pope Urban VIII">{{cite web| work =Galileo Project | title = Pope Urban VIII Biography|url= http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}</ref>\u000a\u000aEarlier, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.\u000a\u000aWhether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, "Simplicio" in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also has the connotation of "simpleton".<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&Wallace-2003|Moss & Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&pg=PA11 p. 11]</ref> This portrayal of Simplicio made ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'' appear as an advocacy book: an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory. Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio.\u000a\u000aMost historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.<ref>See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133\u201334)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].</ref> However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the Copernican advocacy.\u000a\u000aGalileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings<ref>{{cite web |last=Lindberg |first=David |title=Beyond War and Peace: A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}</ref> in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor [[Vincenzo Maculani]] to be [[Criminal charge|charged]]. Throughout his trial Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his ''Dialogue'' could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the ''Dialogue'', his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.<ref>Sharratt ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|1994]], pp. 171\u201375); Heilbron ([[#CITEREFHeilbron2010|2010]], pp. 308\u201317); Gingerich ([[#Reference-Gingerich-1992|1992]], pp. 117\u201318).</ref>\u000a\u000aThe sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June. It was in three essential parts:\u000a* Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture.

He understood the [[parabola]], both in terms of [[conic section]]s and in terms of the [[ordinate]] (y) varying as the square of the [[abscissa]] (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal [[trajectory]] of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of [[air resistance]] or other disturbances.

The [[heliocentric model]] of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the [[Sun]] would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in [[geocentric model#Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy's geocentric model]] it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century as a result of his discovery the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models,<ref>Thoren (1989), p. 8; Hoskin (1999) p. 117.</ref> such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models,<ref>In the Capellan model only Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun, whilst in its extended version such as expounded by Riccioli, Mars also orbits the Sun, but the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are centred on the Earth</ref> each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.\u000a\u000aGalileo observed the planet [[Saturn]], and at first mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.<ref>Baalke, Ron.

Retrieved on 2007-03-11</ref>\u000a\u000aGalileo also observed the planet [[Neptune]] in 1612. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.<ref>Drake & Kowal (1980)</ref>\u000a\u000a===Sunspots===\u000aGalileo was one of the first Europeans to observe [[sunspot]]s, although Kepler had unwittingly observed one in 1607, but mistook it for a [[transit of Mercury]]. He{{who|date=August 2015}} also reinterpreted a sunspot observation from the time of [[Charlemagne]], which formerly had been attributed (impossibly) to a transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. The very existence of sunspots showed another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics. And the annual variations in sunspots' motions, discovered by [[Francesco Sizzi]] and others in 1612\u20131613,<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 209)]]. Sizzi reported the observations he and his companions had made over the course of a year to Orazio Morandi in a letter dated 10 April 1613 [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]],[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=11&VOLPAG=491 1901, 11:491)] {{it icon}}. Morandi subsequently forwarded a copy to Galileo.</ref> provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of [[Tycho Brahe]].<ref name="sunspot argument">In geostatic systems the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots could only be explained as the result of an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(Linton, 2004, p. 212;]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]], 1994, p. 166; [[#Reference-Drake-1970|Drake, 1970, pp. 191\u2013196)]]. This did not apply, however, to the modified version of Tycho's system introduced by his protegé, [[Longomontanus]], in which the Earth was assumed to rotate. Longomontanus's system could account for the apparent motions of sunspots just as well as the Copernican.</ref> A dispute over priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the [[Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]].\u000a\u000aIn fact, there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by [[David Fabricius]] and his son [[Johannes Fabricius|Johannes]]. Scheiner quickly adopted Kepler's 1615 proposal of the modern telescope design, which gave larger magnification at the cost of inverted images; Galileo apparently never changed to Kepler's design.\u000a\u000a===Moon===\u000aPrior to Galileo's construction of his version of a telescope, [[Thomas Harriot]], an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a "perspective tube" to observe the moon. Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only "strange spottednesse" in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, due in part to his artistic training<ref name="panofsky">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/348450 |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |author-link=Erwin Panofsky |title=Galileo as a Critic of the Arts: Aesthetic Attitude and Scientific Thought |journal=Isis |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201315 |date=1956 |jstor=227542}}</ref> and the knowledge of [[chiaroscuro]],<ref name="edgerton">Edgerton, Samuel Y. ''The Mirror, the Window, and the Telescope'', 2009</ref> had understood the patterns of light and shadow were in fact topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and [[impact crater|craters]]. In his study he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first "planet", an "eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian", as put forth by [[Dante]].\u000a\u000a===Milky Way and stars===\u000aGalileo observed the [[Milky Way]], previously believed to be [[Nebula|nebulous]], and found it to be a multitude of [[star]]s packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. He observed the double star [[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] in Ursa Major in 1617.<ref>[[#Reference-Ondra-2004|Ondra (2004), p. 72\u201373]]</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the ''Starry Messenger'', Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope revealed to be discs. But shortly thereafter, in his letters on sunspots, he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be "quite round". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter.<ref>Graney (2010, p. 455); Graney & Grayson (2011, p. 353).</ref> He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his ''Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems'', his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point.<ref>[[#CITEREFVan Helden1985|Van Helden]], (1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-yb7GX9mQIC&pg=PA75 p. 75]); [[#CITEREFChalmers1999|Chalmers]], (1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WQh5wDlE8cwC&pg=PA25 p. 25]); [[#CITEREFGalilei1953|Galilei]] (1953, pp. 361\u201362).</ref> In his ''Dialogue'', he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of [[stellar magnitude|first magnitude]] to be no more than 5 [[arcsecond]]s, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about <sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub> arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see [[Astronomical seeing#The effects of astronomical seeing|seeing disk]] or [[Airy disk]]), and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by [[Tycho brahe#Tycho's geo-heliocentric astronomy|Tycho Brahe]] (see [[Magnitude (astronomy)|Magnitude]]) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable.<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 167\u201376)]], [[#CITEREFGalilei1953|Galilei (1953, pp. 359\u201360)]], [[#Reference-Ondra-2004|Ondra (2004, pp. 74\u20135)]].</ref> Other astronomers such as [[Simon Marius]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], and [[Martin van den Hove|Martinus Hortensius]] made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.<ref>Graney (2010, p. 454-462); Graney & Grayson (2011, p. 352-355).</ref>\u000a\u000a==Engineering==\u000a[[File:Galileo's geometrical and military compass in Putnam Gallery, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|Galileo's geometrical and military compass, thought to have been made c. 1604 by his personal instrument-maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]]]]\u000a\u000aGalileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics.

As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular [[polygon]], computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]] produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.<ref>[[#Reference-Reston-2000|Reston (2000, p. 56).]]</ref>\u000a\u000aIn [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|about 1593]], Galileo constructed a [[Galileo thermometer|thermometer]], using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.\u000a\u000a[[File:Galileo telescope replica.jpg|thumb|left|A replica of the earliest surviving telescope attributed to Galileo Galilei, on display at the [[Griffith Observatory]].]]\u000a\u000aIn 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman [[Thomas Harriot]] and others, among the first to use a [[refracting telescope]] as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons.

He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life; but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by [[Zebulon Pike]] of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable [[marine chronometer]], such as that of [[John Harrison]].<ref>''Longitude: the true story of a lone genius who solved the greatest scientific problem of his time'', Dava Sobel Penguin, 1996 ISBN 0-14-025879-5, ISBN 978-0-14-025879-0</ref> Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an [[escapement]] mechanism for a pendulum clock (called [[Galileo's escapement]]), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s.\u000a\u000a== Physics ==\u000a[[File:Tito Lessi - Galileo and Viviani.jpg|thumb|''Galileo e [[Vincenzo Viviani|Viviani]]'', 1892, [[Tito Lessi]]]]\u000a\u000aGalileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and [[René Descartes]], was a precursor of the [[classical mechanics]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]]. Galileo conducted several experiments with [[pendulum]]s. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by [[Vincenzo Viviani]]) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his ''[[Two New Sciences]]''. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is [[Pendulum#Period of oscillation|isochronous]], i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the [[amplitude]]. In fact, this is only approximately true,<ref>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=R.

Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its [[verge escapement]], would have been a poor timekeeper. (See [[#Engineering|Engineering]] above.)\u000a\u000aGalileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency.

In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the [[Speed of light#Measurement|speed of light]] by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously.<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''Two New Sciences,'' (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1974) p. 50.</ref> Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine ''[[Accademia del Cimento]]'' repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result.<ref>I.

Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special theory of relativity]].\u000a\u000a=== Falling bodies ===\u000a{{see also|Equations for a falling body}}\u000a[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogg|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]A biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]] stated that Galileo had [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped balls]] of the same material, but different [[mass]]es, from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, pp. 19,20)]].
