Free logic itself is an adjustment of a given standard [[predicate logic]] such as to relieve it of existential assumptions, and so make it a free logic. Taking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s predicate logic in his ''Principia Mathematica'' as standard, one replaces universal instantiation, <math>\u005cforall x \u005c,\u005cphi x \u005crightarrow \u005cphi y</math>, with universal specification <math>(\u005cforall x \u005c,\u005cphi x \u005cand E!y \u005c,\u005cphi y) \u005crightarrow \u005cphi z</math>. Thus universal statements, like "All men are mortal," or "Everything is a unicorn," do not presuppose that there are men or that there is anything.  These would be symbolized, with the appropriate predicates, as <math>\u005cforall x\u005c,(Mx \u005crightarrow Lx)</math> and <math>\u005cforall x\u005c, Ux</math>, which in ''Principia Mathematica'' entail <math>\u005cexists x\u005c,(Mx \u005cand Lx)</math> and <math>\u005cexists x\u005c,Ux</math>, but not in free logic.  The truth of these last statements, when used in a free logic, depend on the [[Domain of discourse|domain of quantification]], which may be the null set.\u000a\u000a==Published works==\u000a* ''Philosophical Applications of Free Logic'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1991, "A Theory of Definite Descriptions", pp.&nbsp;17\u201327, details an account of Russell's Theory of Descriptions in free logic. In the process, he demonstrates how a formulation from Hintikka allows for a contradiction by a correlate in logic to Russell's Paradox. He introduces the predicate <math>(\u005clambda x)(\u005cphi x \u005cand \u005cneg \u005cphi x)</math>\u000a* ''Free Logic.
