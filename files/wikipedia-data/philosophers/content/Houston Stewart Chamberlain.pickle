Chamberlain's two-volume book, ''Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' (''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]''),<ref>{{Citation |last=Chamberlain |first=Houston Stewart |year=1899 |title=Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts |publisher=F.

His mother, Eliza Jane, daughter of Captain [[Basil Hall]], RN, died before he was a year old; his grandmother brought him up in France. Chamberlain's poor health frequently led him to being sent to the warmer climates of [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] for the winter. This constant moving about made it hard for Chamberlain to form lasting friendships and left him with a feeling of rootlessness, of not belonging anywhere.\u000a{{Nazism sidebar}}\u000aChamberlain's education, begun in a ''[[lycée]]'' at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], took place mostly on the Continent, but his father had planned a military career for his son and at the age of eleven he was sent to [[Cheltenham College]], an English [[boarding school]] which produced many army and navy officers.<ref>[[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Redesdale, Lord]], "Introduction" to ''Foundations of the Nineteenth Century'', London, 4th English language impression, 1913, p. vi</ref> Chamberlain grew up in a self-confident, optimistic Victorian atmosphere that celebrated the 19th century as the "Age of Progress"; a time of growing wealth, scientific discoveries, technological advances and democratic political reforms, a world that many Victorians only expected to get progressively better and better with Britain of course leading the way for the rest of the world.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 20-21</ref> Chamberlain grew up as a [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal]], and shared the general values of 19th century British liberalism such as a faith in progress, of a world that could only get better, of the greatness of Britain as a liberal democratic and capitalist society.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 23 & 27.</ref> The young Chamberlain was "a compulsive dreamer", more interested in the arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-[[mysticism|mystical]] sense of self.<ref name="Mosse, George L 1968">Mosse, George L.

The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic - for that is the only word which describes my feelings - than any of the people around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true ''friendship''".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 24"/> During his youth, Chamberlain - while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism - become influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution, which bemoaned the loss of [[Merry England|"Merry Old England"]], a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history.<ref name="Mosse, George L 1968"/> In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.<ref name="Mosse, George L 1968"/> The prospect of serving as an officer in [[British India|India]] or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]] held no attraction for him. In addition, he was a delicate child with poor health. At the age of fourteen he had to be withdrawn from school. After Cheltenham, Chamberlain always felt out of place in Britain, a society whose values Chamberlain felt were not his values, writing in 1876: \u201cThe fact may be regrettable but it remains a fact; I have become so completely un-English that the mere thought of England and the English makes me unhappy\u201d.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 32</ref>\u000a\u000aHe then travelled to various [[destination spa|spas]] around Europe, accompanied by a [[Prussia]]n tutor, Herr Otto Kuntze, who taught him German and interested him in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] and [[History of Germany|history]]. Fascinated by Renaissance art and architecture, Chamberlain learned Italian and planned to settle in [[Florence]].<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 36-37</ref> Chamberlain then went to [[Geneva]], where he studied under [[Carl Vogt]] (a supporter of racial typology at the [[University of Geneva]]),<ref>Bramwell, A., ''Blood and Soil \u2013 Richard Walther Darré and Hitler's "Green Party"'', London, 1985, p. 206, ISBN 0-946041-33-4</ref> Graebe, [[Johannes Müller Argoviensis|Müller Argoviensis]], Thury, Plantamour, and other professors.

His thesis, ''Recherches sur la sève ascendante'' (''Studies on rising sap''), was not finished until 1897<ref>published by Attinger Fréres at Neuchatel the same year</ref> and did not culminate in a further qualification.<ref name=Powell>{{cite book |last=Powell |first=J. |author2=D.W.

He summarises his thesis in the Introduction: {{quote|text=Without the participation of these vital functions it is quite simply impossible for water to rise to heights of 150&nbsp;feet, 200&nbsp;feet and beyond, and all the efforts that one makes to hide the difficulties of the problem by relying on confused notions drawn from [[physics]] are little more reasonable than the search for the [[philosopher's stone]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Chamberlain. |first =H.S. |title=Recherche sur la sève ascendante |year=1897 |publisher=Attinger Freres, Editeurs |page=8 |location=Neuchâtel }}</ref>}} Physical arguments, in particular [[transpirational pull]] and [[root pressure]], have since been shown to be adequate for explaining the ascent of sap.<ref>Melvin T.

preference for speaking French over English.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 219">Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' London: Vintage Books, 2000 page 219.</ref> It was only at the age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of [[Richard Wagner]]\u2014which struck him with all the force of a religious revelation\u2014that Chamberlain become not only a Wagnerite, but an ardent [[Germanophile]] and [[Francophobe]].<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 219"/><ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 53-54</ref> As he put later, it was then he realized the full "degeneracy" of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, who Chamberlain viewed as one of the great geniuses of all time.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 219"/> In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain finally found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had been unsuccessfully seeking to find in British and French cultures.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 219"/> Further increasing his love of Germany  was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst, and she with him.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 33">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 33</ref> As Chamberlain's wealthy, snobbish family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst on the grounds that she was socially unsuitable for him, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 33"/> By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic "land of love", a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 33-35</ref> In 1883-1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 41-43.</ref> Chamberlain's attempts to play the Paris bourse ended in failure as he proved to be inept at business, and much of his hatred of capitalism stemmed from his time in Paris.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 43-44.</ref> More happily for him, Chamberlain founded the first Wagner society in Paris and often contributed articles to the ''Revue Wagnérienne'', the first journal in France devoted to Wagner studies.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 60-62 & 64-67.</ref> Together with his friend, the French writer [[Édouard Dujardin]] Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner's music.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 64.</ref>\u000a\u000aThereafter he settled in [[Dresden]], where "he plunged heart and soul into the mysterious depths of [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] music and philosophy, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of the Master probably exercising as strong an influence upon him as the musical dramas".<ref name="Redesdale, Lord 1913"/> Chamberlain immersed himself in philosophical writings, and became a ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' author, one of those concerned more with a highly racist understanding of art, culture, civilisation and spirit than with quantitative physical distinctions between groups.<ref>Bramwell, A., ''Blood and Soil \u2013 Richard Walther Darré and Hitler's "Green Party"'', London, 1985, pps: 23 and 40, ISBN 0-946041-33-4</ref> This is evidenced by his huge treatise on [[Immanuel Kant]]<ref>''Immanuel Kant. Die Persönlichkeit als Einführung in das Werk'', Bruckmann, 1905.</ref> with its comparisons. His knowledge of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is demonstrated in that work (p.&nbsp;183) and in ''Foundations'' (p.&nbsp;153n). It was during his time in Dresden that Chamberlain came to embrace ''völkisch'' thought through his study of Wagner, and 1884 onwards, anti-Semitic and racist statements become the norm in his letters to his family in Britain.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 83</ref> In 1888, Chamberlain wrote to his family proclaiming his joy at the death of the Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich III]], a strong opponent of anti-Semitism whom Chamberlain called a "Jewish liberal", and rejoicing that his anti-Semitic son Wilhelm II was now on the throne.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 90.</ref> June 1888 was an auspicious month for Chamberlain. Besides for the death of the "Jew-lover" Friedrich III, June 1888 also saw Chamberlain's first visit to the [[Wahnfried]] to meet [[Cosima Wagner]], the reclusive leader of the Wagner cult.<ref>Biddiss, Michael "History as Destiny: Gobineau, H. S. Chamberlain and Spengler" pages 73-100 from ''The Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', Volume 7, 1997 page 80.</ref> Chamberlain later recalled that Cosima Wagner had "electrified" him as he felt the "deepest love" for Wagner's widow while Wagner wrote to a friend that she felt a "great friendship" with Chamberlain "because of his outstanding learning and dignified character."<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 74.</ref> Wagner came to regard Chamberlain as her surrogate son.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 75">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 75.</ref> Under her influence, Chamberlain abandoned his previous belief that art was a separate entity from other fields and came to embrace the ''völkisch'' belief of the unity of race, art, nation and politics.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 75"/>\u000a\u000aSaxony was a center of ''völkisch'' activity in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon ''Landtag'' in 1893, ''völkisch'' candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 89.</ref> Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was to a certain extent an outsider in his adopted country-a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being ''plus royaliste que le roi'', Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to ''völkisch'' politics.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 331">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 331</ref> Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized with most of the time.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 331"/> Chamberlain\u2019s friend [[Hermann Graf Keyserling|Hermann Keyserling]] later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English \u201cindividualist\u201d who \u201cnever saw Germany as it really is\u201d, instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 320">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 320.</ref> This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 58.</ref> To compensate, Chamberlain become ''über deutsche'', the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans.\u000a\u000aBy this time Chamberlain had met his first wife, the [[Prussian]] [[Anna Horst]], whom he would divorce in 1905 after 28 years of marriage.<ref>[[William L.

In particular, Wagner's lively sex life presented a problem for Chamberlain. Wagner had abandoned his first wife Minna, had an open affair with the married woman Mathilde Wesendonck and had started sleeping with his second wife Cosima while she was still married to her first husband.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 133">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 133</ref> Chamberlain in his Wagner biography went to considerable lengths to distort the Master's love-life such as implying that Wagner's relationship with Cosima von Bülow only started after the death of her first husband.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 133"/> \u000a[[File:Hschamberlain1895.jpg|right|thumb|Houston Stewart Chamberlain in 1895]]\u000a\u000aDuring his time in Dresden, Chamberlain like many other ''völkisch'' activists became fascinated with Hindu mythology and legend, and learned [[Sanskrit]] in order to read the ancient Indian epics like the ''[[Vedas]]'' and the ''[[Upanishads]]'' in the original.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 304">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 304</ref> In these stories about ancient Aryan heroes conquering the Indian subcontinent, Chamberlain found a very appealing world governed by a rigid caste system with social inferiors firmly locked into their place; full of larger-than-life Aryan gods and aristocratic heroes and a world that focused on the spiritual at the expense of the material.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 304"/> Since by this time, historians, archeologists and linguists had all accepted that the Aryans ("light ones") of Hindu legend were an Indo-European people, Chamberlain had little trouble arguing that these Aryans were in fact Germanic peoples, and modern Germans had much to learn from [[Hinduism]], stating "in the night of the inner life...the Indian...finds his way in the dark more surely than anyone".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 304"/> For Chamberlain the Hindu texts offered a body of pure Aryan thought that made it possible to find the harmony of humanity and nature, which provided the unity of thought, purpose and action that provided the necessary spirituality for Aryan peoples to find true happiness in a world being destroyed by a soulless materialism.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 304-305</ref> The popularity of the Hindu texts with the ''völkisch'' movement explains why the swastika, an ancient Indian symbol was adopted by the ''völkisch'' activists as one of their symbols.\u000a\u000a==Champion of Wagnerism==\u000aIn 1889 he moved to [[Austria]]. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, influenced by the concept of [[Teutons|Teutonic]] supremacy he believed embodied in the works of [[Richard Wagner]] and the French racist [[Arthur de Gobineau]].<ref name="CHASE">Chase, Allan. "The Legacy of Malthus: The Social Costs of the New Scientific Racism." New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1977, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> In his book [[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races|''Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines'']], the aristocratic snob Gobineau had invented the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standing as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 152</ref> Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst what was left of the "Aryan race", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  pages 152-153</ref> The Franco-Israeli [[historian]] [[Saul Friedländer]] wrote that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely \u201credemptive anti-semitism\u201d, a type of [[Völkisch movement|''völkisch'']] anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of \u201credemption\u201d for the anti-Semitic.<ref name="Friedländer, Saul page 87">Friedländer, Saul ''Nazi Germany and the Jews: Volume 1: The Years of Persecution 1933-1939'', New York: Harper Perennial 1998 page 87.</ref> Chamberlain had attended [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, [[Franz Liszt]]'s granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow-despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year he moved to Germany and became an important member of the "[[Bayreuth Circle]]" of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the Master's message of racial hatred.<ref name="Friedländer, Saul page 89">Friedländer, Saul ''Nazi Germany and the Jews: Volume 1: The Years of Persecution 1933-1939'', New York: Harper Perennial 1998 page 89.</ref> Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:<blockquote>"Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 150">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 150.</ref></blockquote> In another letter, Chamberlain stated that about the purpose of the Wagner cult:<blockquote>"If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning-that mankind must awaken to a consciousness of its 'pristine holy worth'-then the Babylonian tower of senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our being forever".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 150"/></blockquote> In Chamberlain's viewpoint, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 150"/> As such, Chamberlain become engulfed in the \u201credemptive anti-semitism\u201d that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult.<ref name="Friedländer, Saul page 87"/>\u000a\u000a==Vienna years==\u000aIn September 1891 Chamberlain visited [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as a journalist.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 98</ref> In 1878, the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina were occupied by Austria-Hungary; though the two provinces remained nominally Ottoman until 1908, in practice they were part of the Austrian empire from 1878 onwards. Because Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire, neither province was represented in the Austrian ''Reichsrat'' or the Hungarian Diet, and instead the two provinces were in practice a colony of Austria-Hungary. Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper. Chamberlain\u2019s Bosnia articles reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for having utterly no democratic aspects to their rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 100">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981, page 100</ref> Chamberlain wrote that he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner\u2019s dictum: \u201cAbsolute monarch-free people!\u201d<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 100"/> Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic \u201cparliamentary regime\u201d, instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was best for them.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 100"/> Equally important in Chamberlain\u2019s Bosnian articles was his celebration of \u201cnatural man\u201d who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 101">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 101</ref> At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages. Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the \u201cwesternization\u201d being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  pages 100\u2013101</ref> Chamberlain wrote about the average Bosnian: <blockquote>"He [the Bosnian peasant] builds his house, he makes his shoes, and plough, etc; the woman weaves and dyes the stuffs and cooks the food. When we have civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner-then Bosnia will no longer be interesting to us".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 101"/></blockquote> Chamberlain\u2019s awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 101"/> In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the [[Middle Ages]] and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 101"/> In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhymes of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal. Remembering Bosnia several years later, Chamberlain wrote: <blockquote>\u201cThe spirit of a natural man, who does everything and must create everything for himself in life, is decidedly more universal and more harmoniously developed than the spirit of an industrial worker whose whole life is occupied with the manufacturing of a single object\u2026and that only with the aid of a complicated machine, whose functioning is quite foreign to him. A similar degeneration is taking place amongst peasants: an American farmer in the Far West is today only a kind of subordinate engine driver. Also among us in Europe it becomes every day more impossible for a peasant to exist, for agriculture must be carried out in \u2018large units\u2019-the peasant consequently becomes increasingly like an industrial worker. His understanding dries up; there is no longer an interaction between his spirit and surrounding Nature\u201d.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 101"/></blockquote> Chamberlain's nostalgia for a pre-industrial way of life that he expressed so strongly in his Bosnia articles earned him ridicule as many believed that he had an absurdly idealized and romanticized view of the rural life that he never experienced first-hand.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981, page 102</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1893 after receiving a letter from [[Cosima Wagner]] telling him that he had to read Gobineau's ''Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines'', Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request.<ref>Biddiss, Michael "History as Destiny: Gobineau, H.

Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909 when he moved to [[Bayreuth]], Chamberlain had nothing, but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the ''Völkerchaos'' (chaos of the peoples).<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 114\u2013115.</ref> Vienna had a large Jewish population, and Chamberlain's time in Vienna marked the only time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 115-116.</ref> In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: "Unfortunately like everything else...it has fallen into the hands of the Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 116">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 116.</ref> In 1895, he wrote:<blockquote> "However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew...it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it...Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 116"/></blockquote> In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was "one of the most acute minds of the century" and "I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon."<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 81.</ref> Through Chamberlain was always very supportive of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world\u2019s biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 353"/> In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the [[Hamidian massacres]] in the Ottoman Empire during 1894\u201396:<blockquote>\u201dThe Armenian insurrection [of 1894] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course ''enormously exaggerated'' by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics required a 'diversion'.\u201d<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 353"/></blockquote> In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:<blockquote>\u201dThe English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal ''bully'', always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking as if it were umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding ''War'' predicated or threatened\u2026No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace-England alone, the world\u2019s bully, has been stirring it up on all sides.\u201d<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 355-356</ref></blockquote> During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in [[South Africa]], writing to his uncle in 1898: <blockquote>"We are ''the'' heathen nation and race ''par excellence''. War, conquest, commerce, money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions and acts is in direct contradiction."<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 356</ref></blockquote> At the time of the [[Boer War]], Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, through not publicity  and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other at a time when he believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged "[[Yellow Peril]]".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 357">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 357</ref> In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: <blockquote>"One thing I can clearly see, that is that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction...The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome-and ''has'' it been overcome?-by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only."<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 357"/></blockquote> Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the [[Randlords]] were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 357-358.</ref>\u000a\u000aAs a leading Wagnerite in Vienna, Chamberlain befriended a number of other prominent Wagnerites such as [[Hermann, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Prince Hohenhohe-Langenburg]], Ludwig Schemann, Georg Meurer, and Baron [[Christian von Ehrenfels]].<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 128</ref>  The most important friendship that Chamberlain made during his time in Vienna was with German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, [[Philip, Prince of Eulenburg|Prince Philip von Eulenburg]], who shared Chamberlain's love of Wagnerian music. Besides for being a passionate Wagnerite, Eulenburg was also an anti-Semite, an Anglophobe and a convinced enemy of democracy who found much to admire in Chamberlain's anti-Semitic, anti-British and anti-democratic writings.<ref>Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' London: Vintage Books, 2000 page 218</ref>\u000a\u000a==''Die Grundlagen'' (''The Foundations'')==\u000a{{main|The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century}}\u000aIn February 1896, the Munich publisher [[Hugo Bruckmann]], a leading ''völkisch'' activist who was later to publish ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' commissioned Chamberlain to write a book that was intended to summarize all of the achievements of the 19th century.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 169-170.</ref> In October 1899 Chamberlain published his most famous work, ''Die Grundlagen des Neunzehnten Jahrhunderts,'' in German. ''The Foundations''  are a pseudo-scientific "racial history" of humanity from the emergence of the first civilizations in the ancient Near East to the year 1800, and argued that all of the "foundations" of the great 19th century which saw huge economic, scientific and technological advances in the West were the work of the "Aryan race". ''Die Grundlagen''  was only the first volume of an intended three-volume history of the West with the second and third volumes taking up the story of the West in the 19th century and the looming war for world domination in the coming 20th century between the Aryans on one side vs. the Jews, blacks and Asians on the other side.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 171-172</ref> Chamberlain never wrote the second or third volumes, much to the intense annoyance of [[Cosima Wagner]] who was upset that ''Die Grundlagen''  stopped in 1800 before Wagner was born, and thus gave her late husband short shift.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 343-345</ref> The book argued that [[western culture|Western civilisation]] is deeply marked by the influence of [[Teutons|Teutonic]] peoples. Chamberlain grouped all European peoples \u2013 not just [[Germanic peoples|Germans]], but [[Celtic people|Celts]], [[Slavic people|Slavs]], [[Greeks]], and [[Latin people|Latins]] \u2013 into the "[[Aryan race]]," a race built on the ancient [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] culture. In fact he even included the [[Berber people]] of North Africa in the Aryan race: "The noble Moor of Spain is anything but a pure Arab of the desert, he is half a Berber (from the Aryan family) and his veins are so full of Gothic blood that even at the present day noble inhabitants of Morocco can trace their descent back to Teutonic ancestors."<ref>Houston Stewart Chamberlain, The Foundations of the 19th Century (1899), Adamant Media Corporation, 2005, p.398, [http://www.hschamberlain.net/grundlagen/division2_chapter5.html chap.5]</ref> At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, according to Chamberlain, were the Germanic or Teutonic peoples, who had best preserved the Aryan blood.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 223">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 223</ref> Chamberlain used the terms Aryan, Indo-European and Indo-Germanic interchangeably, but he went out of his way to emphasis that purest Aryans were to be found in Central Europe and that in both France and Russia miscegenation had diluted the Aryan blood.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 191</ref> The Russians in particular had become a semi-Asian people on the account of the rule of the [[Golden Horde]]. Much of Chamberlain's theory about the superiority of the Aryan race was taken from the writings of the French racist [[Arthur de Gobineau]], but there was a crucial difference in that Gobineau had used the Aryan race theory as a way of dividing society between an Aryan nobility vs. racially inferior commoners whereas Chamberlain used the Aryan racial theory as a way of uniting society around its supposed common racial origins.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 223-224</ref>\u000a\u000aEverything that Chamberlain viewed as good in the world was ascribed to the Aryans. For  an example, in ''The Foundations''  Chamberlain explained at considerable length that [[Jesus Christ]] could not possibly be a Jew, and very strongly implied that Christ was an Aryan.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 183</ref> Chamberlain's tendency to see everything good as the work of the Aryans allowed him to claim whoever he approved of for the Aryan race, which at least was part of the appeal of the book in Germany when it was published in 1899. Chamberlain claimed all of the glories and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome as due entirely to Aryan blood which supposedly flowed in the veins of the ancient Greeks and Romans.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 180</ref> Chamberlain wrote that ancient Greece was a "lost ideal" of beautiful thought and art that the modern Germans were best placed to recover if only the German people could embrace Wagner.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  pages 180-181.</ref> Chamberlain praised Rome for its militarism, civic values, patriotism, respect for the law and reverence for the family as offering the best sort of Aryan government.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 182">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 182.</ref> Reflecting his opposition to [[feminism]], Chamberlain lamented that about why modern women could not be like the submissive women of ancient Rome whom he claimed were most happy in obeying the wills of their husbands.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 182"/> Chamberlain asserted that Aryans and Aryans alone are the only people in the entire world capable of creating beautiful art and thinking great thoughts, so he claimed all of the great artists, writers and thinkers of the West such as [[Homer]], [[Dante]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Martin Luther]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] as part of one long glorious tradition of beautiful Aryan art and thought, which Chamberlain planned to have culminate with the life-changing, racially regenerating music of [[Richard Wagner]] in the 19th century.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 196-198</ref> As the British historian [[George Peabody Gooch]] wrote, here was "a glittering vision of mind and muscle, of large scale organization, of intoxicating self-confidence, of metallic brilliancy, such as Europe has never seen".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 196</ref>\u000a\u000aThe antithesis of the heroic Aryan race with its vital, creative life-improving qualities was the "Jewish race", whom Chamberlain presented as the inverse of the Aryan. Every positive quality the Aryans had, the Jews had the exact opposing negative quality.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 190-191 & 195</ref> The American historian Geoffrey Field wrote: <blockquote>"To each negative "Semitic" trait Chamberlain counter-posed a Teutonic virtue. Kantian moral freedom took the place of political liberty and egalitarianism. Irresponsible Jewish capitalism was sharply distinguished from the vague ideal of Teutonic industrialism, a romantic vision of an advanced technological society which had somehow managed to retain the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'', cooperation and hierarchy of the medieval guilds. The alternative to Marxism was "ethical socialism", such as that described by [[Thomas More]], "one of the most exquisite scholars ever produced by a Teutonic people, of an absolutely aristocratic, refined nature". In the rigidly elitist, disciplined society of [[Utopia (book)|''Utopia'']] with its strong aura of Christian humanism, Chamberlain found an approximation of his own nostalgic, communal ideal. "The gulf separating More from Marx", he wrote, "is not the progress of time, but the contrast between Teuton and Jew"".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 195</ref></blockquote> Chamberlain announced in ''The Foundations'' that "all the wars" in history were "so peculiarly connected with Jewish financial operations".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 190">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 190</ref> Chamberlain warned that the aim of the Jew was "to put his foot upon the neck of all nations of the world and be Lord and possessor of the whole earth".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 189">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 189</ref> As part of their plans to destroy Aryan civilization, Chamberlain wrote: "Consider, with what mastery they use the law of blood to extend their power."<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 189"/> Chamberlain wrote that Jewish women were encouraged to marry Gentiles while Jewish men were not, so the male line "remained spotless...thousands of side-branches are cut off and employed to infect Indo-Europeans with Jewish blood".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 189"/> In his account of the [[Punic wars]] between "Aryan Rome" and "Semitic Carthage", Chamberlain praised the Romans for their [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|total destruction of Carthage]] in 146 BC at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] as an example of how Aryans should deal with Semites.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 182</ref> Later on, Chamberlain argued that the Romans become too tolerant of Semites like the Jews, and this was the cause of the downfall of the Roman empire.<ref name="ReferenceA">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 182</ref> Chamberlain argued that it was due to [[miscegenation]] that the Jews had caused the Aryan [[Roman Empire]] to go into decline and collapse.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Chamberlain wrote that the \u201cAfrican half breed soldier emperor\u201d [[Caracalla]] had granted Roman citizenship to all the subjects in the Empire regardless of race or religion in 212 AD, and as result of this, the Romans had freely mixed with Semitic and African peoples, leading Chamberlain to conclude: \u201cLike a cataract the alien blood poured down into the depopulated city of Rome and soon the Romans ceased to exist\u201d.<ref>page 182.</ref> As such, the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the Germanic peoples were merely an act of liberation from the ''Völkerchaos'' (\u201cChaos of the Peoples\u201d) that the Roman empire had become.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 184.</ref>\u000a\u000aThe ultimate aim of the Jew according to Chamberlain was to create a situation were "there would be in Europe only a single people of pure race, the Jews, all the rest would be a herd of pseudo-Hebraic mestizos, a people beyond all doubt degenerate physically, mentally and morally".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 189"/> As part of their plans to destroy the Aryans, Chamberlain claimed that the Jews had founded the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which only preached a "Judaized" Christianity that had nothing to do with the Christianity created by the Aryan Christ.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 192">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 192</ref> At least some historians have argued that ''The Foundations'' are actually more anti-Catholic than anti-Semitic, but this misses the point that the reason why Chamberlain attacked the Catholic Church so fiercely was because he believed the Papacy was controlled by the Jews.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 192"/> In the 16th century, Chamberlain claimed that the Aryan Germans under the leadership of [[Martin Luther]] had broken away from the corrupt influence of Rome, and so laid the foundations of a "Germanic Christianity".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 194</ref> Chamberlain claimed that the natural and best form of government for Aryans was a dictatorship, and so he blamed the Jews for inventing democracy as part of their plans for destroying the Aryans.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 190"/> In the same way, Chamberlain blamed capitalism-which he saw as a very destructive economic system-as something invented by the Jews to enrich themselves at the expense of the Aryans while at the same time crediting the Jews with inventing socialism with its message of universal human equality as a cunning Jewish stratagem to divert attention away from all the economic devastation wrought by Jewish financiers.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 190"/> Chamberlain's relentless determination to prove that everything he viewed as evil in the world as the work of the Jews led him to some odd conclusions. Chamberlain had a deep dislike of the Chinese, and so in  ''The Foundations'' he announced that [[Chinese culture|Chinese civilization]] had been founded by the Jews because just like the Jews, the Chinese had "...the total absence of all culture and the one-sided emphasizing of civilization."<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 193</ref> For Chamberlain, this was more than sufficient proof that the Jews had created Chinese civilization.\u000a\u000aThe Franco-Israeli historian [[Saul Friedländer]] described ''The Foundations''-with its theory of two "pure" races left in the world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other-as one of the key texts of "redemptive anti-semitism".<ref name="Friedländer, Saul page 89"/> Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a \u201csolution\u201d to the \u201cJewish Question\u201d, stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 311</ref> In taking this stance, Chamberlain was going beyond his hero Wagner. The Dutch journalist [[Ian Buruma]] wrote:<blockquote>\u201cWagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it with his customary charm, \u201cannihilate\u201d his Jewishness by repudiating his ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory a Jew could be a German\u2026But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the national bloodstream.

The lack of precision, the muddle, and logical flaws that are so apparent to modern readers of ''The Foundations'' did not bother Wilhelm: he eagerly submitted to its subjective, irrational style of reasoning...And if the Kaiser was a Prussian with an ingrained respect for English values and habits, Chamberlain was just as much an Englishman who was deeply ambivalent about his own birthplace and who revered German qualities and Prussian society. Almost unconsciously, as his vast correspondence shows, he adopted an obsequious, scraping tone when addressing the lowliest of Prussian army officers.

Since Eulenburg had been the Emperor's best friend since 1886, the scandal led to much gossip all over the ''Reich'' about whether Wilhelm and Eulenburg had been more than just best friends. Since Eulenburg was quite open about being gay when he was in the company of his closest friends, and he and Wilhelm had been the very best of friends for 22 years, leading the British historian [[John C. G. Röhl]] to conclude it was very unlikely that Wilhelm was ignorant of Eulenburg's sexual orientation as he claimed after Eulenburg was outed.<ref>Röhl, John ''The Kaiser and His Court'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 61-62.</ref> After Eulenburg was exposed, the Kaiser wrote him a very cold letter saying that he could not stand the company of homosexuals, as such their friendship was now over and he never wanted to see or hear from Eulenburg again. Chamberlain was nowhere never as close to Eulenburg as Wilhelm was, and seemed genuinely shocked to learn of the allegations that Eulenburg was gay.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 260</ref> The Eulenburg affair played a role in Germany very similar to the Dreyfus affair in France except the victim in this case was the prominent anti-Semite Eulenburg. During the scandal, practically the entire ''völkisch'' movement came out in support of Eulenburg whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual framed by false allegations of homosexuality by the Jews' [[Max Bernstein]] and Dr. [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].<ref>Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 169</ref> The German journalist [[Theodor Wolff]] wrote in 1906 about Eulenburg's role as one of Germany's chief anti-Semites : <blockquote>"I bet you ten to one that it was that ''skald'' [Eulenburg], the friend and admirer of Gobineau, who first pointed his other friend, the Kaiser towards the racial prophet's most eager disciple, Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The mystical notion of the 'race that will bring order to the world' found its way from Gobineau via Eulenburg and Chamberlain to the Kaiser, and this notion in turn gave rise to the thought that 'the world should be healed by the German spirt.'"<ref>Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 172.</ref></blockquote> In a letter to Chamberlain, Wilhelm wrote that entire scandal had emerged because of "Jewish cheek, slander and lies".<ref name="Röhl, John page 206">Röhl, John ''The Kaiser and His Court'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 206.</ref> In the same letter, an enraged Wilhelm told Chamberlain that [[Maximilian Harden]], the German Jewish convert to Lutheranism and the journalist who had [[Outing|outed]] Eulenburg was a "loathsome, dirty Jewish fiend" and a "poisonous toad out of the slime of hell, a disgraceful stain on our ''Volk''".<ref name="Röhl, John page 206"/> However, despite his strongly held anti-Semitism and his frequently expressed wish to expel the entire German Jewish community, the Kaiser held back under the grounds that if he expelled all of the Jews from Germany, it would set the German economy back by a century, and as such, he had to grudgingly tolerate his Jewish subjects.<ref>Röhl, John ''The Kaiser and His Court'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 206-207.</ref>\u000a  \u000aAs a part of his role as the \u201cEvangelist of Race\u201d, Chamberlain toned his anti-Catholicism in the first decade of the 20th century, realizing belatedly that his attacks on the Catholic Church in ''The Foundations'' had alienated the German Catholic community from his message.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 307-309</ref> As a well-known public intellectual, Chamberlain wrote on numerous subjects in a vast array of newspapers and magazines. Besides for attacking the Jews, one of the chief themes of Chamberlain\u2019s essays was the unity of German culture, language, race and art and the need for the unity of German art with a racialized \u201cGermanic Christianity\u201d.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 310-311</ref> The other major theme of Chamberlain\u2019s work was science and philosophy. Chamberlain was always keenly interested in modern science and saw himself as a scientist, but he was deeply critical of the claim that modern science could explain everything, believing there was a spiritual side to humanity that science could not explain.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 280-281</ref> As such, Chamberlain believed that modern Germany was being destroyed by people losing their spiritual aspects owing to the materialist belief that science could explain all.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 281</ref> In his 1905 biography of one of his heroes, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown the limits of rationalism and reason for understanding the world.<ref>pages 283</ref> Instead, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown that the  instinctive approach based on intuition was a far more valid way of understanding the world.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 283</ref> Inevitably, Chamberlain\u2019s \u201cKantian\u201d way of understanding science was used to attack the Jews with Chamberlain writing: \u201cIn order to understand Kant we must\u2026begin by once and for all  getting rid of the heavy burden of inherited and indoctrinated Jewish conceptions\u201d.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 284</ref> In the same way, Chamberlain\u2019s 1912 biography of another of his heroes, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] was used to pass on the same message. Chamberlain depicted Goethe as a \u201cKantian\u201d man who had correctly embraced both the rational, scientific and instinctive, mystical approaches to life to achieve a synthesis that embraced the best of both worlds.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 287-290</ref>  Again, Chamberlain used Goethe as a way of bashing the Jews, with Chamberlain claiming Goethe was for banning Aryan-Jewish sex and was a man who would not \u201csuffered among us\u201d Jewish artists, journalists, and professors in modern Germany.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 290">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 290</ref> The German Jewish journal ''Im deutschen Reich'' wrote in a review of ''Goethe'' that Chamberlain had appropriated Goethe in \u201ca polemic about race politics, racial hygiene and racial worth from the standpoint of a monomaniacal Judeophobia\u201d.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 290"/>\u000a\u000aThe polices of ''Weltpolitik'', especially the [[Tirpitz Plan]] brought about a period of Anglo-German tension in the first years of the 20th century. Chamberlain who detested the land of his birth had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 357-358</ref> Chamberlain who come to hate Britain expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonesty vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 358"/> In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: "There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom.. in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined...We find ourselves in such a time today."<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 359-360">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 359-360</ref> Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and the good of the rest of the world.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 360">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 360</ref> In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of "stupid" Slavs which only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood, without the German blood in the House of Romanov "nothing would remain but a decaying ''matière brute''" in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 359-360"/> Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a "Dollar dynasty", writing: <blockquote>"From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, not a moment longer. That part of the world , it may be proven, creates sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 360"/></blockquote> Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: "The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 360"/> To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the [[High Seas Fleet]] which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing, ''völkisch'' [[Pan-German League]].<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 360-361</ref>\u000a\u000a==Propagandist of the World War==\u000aIn August 1914 he started suffering from a progressive [[paralysis]] of the limbs.<ref name=Otness>{{cite web |url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1841&context=open_access_etds |title=H.

When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 363</ref> In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the [[Japanology|Japanologist]] [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]], explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: "No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse...Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 352</ref> The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an "Aryan soldier-king" and as a "Siegfried" who had embraced the "struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry".<ref name="Röhl, John page 207">Röhl, John ''The Kaiser and His Court'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 207.</ref> Chamberlain went on to call the war "a life-or-death struggle...between two human ideals: the German and the un-German".<ref name="Röhl, John page 207"/> Accordingly, the ''Reich'' must "for the next hundred years or more" strengthen all things German and carry out "the determined extermination of the un-German".<ref name="Röhl, John page 207"/> Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: "I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations-1870 and 1914-and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes."<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 381">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 381</ref> In his 1914 essay, "Whose Fault Is the War?", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 365</ref> Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war and the French and Russians were just British puppets.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 365-366</ref>  Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 381"/> In 1916 he also acquired [[German citizenship]]. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited,<ref>Adorno, Theodor W. "On the Question: "What is German?"" trans. Levin, Thomas Y. ''New German Critique'', No. 36. 1985. p. 123.</ref> were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German [[Romanticism]] akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at [[Cheltenham College|Cheltenham]]. The British historian [[John C. G. Röhl]] wrote the war made the "brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular" of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain "more intense".<ref name="Röhl, John page 207"/>\u000a\u000aDuring World War I, Chamberlain published several propaganda texts against his country of birth \u2013 ''Kriegsaufsätze'' (Wartime Essays). In the first four tracts, he maintains that Germany is a nation of peace; England's political system is a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining "living" language; and the world would be better off doing away with English and French-styled [[parliamentary government]]s in favour of German rule "thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence." The final two discuss England and Germany at length.<ref>Chamberlain, Houston Stewart, [https://archive.org/details/ravingsofrenegad00chamuoft ''The Ravings of a Renegade: Being the War Essays of Houston Stewart Chamberlain.''] Translated with a Preface by Charles H. Clark, PhD., and an Introduction by Lewis Melville, Jarrold and Sons, London, 1915.</ref> Chamberlain's basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth-humans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the next was a completely flawed system.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 368-369</ref> Quoting the French scientist [[Gustave Le Bon]], Chamberlain wrote the vast majority of people were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 369</ref> In Germany, Chamberlain asserted true freedom existed as freedom came from the state which alone made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 368">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 368</ref> Field summarized Chamberlain's thesis "...the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Cosigning "liberty" to an inner, "nonpolitical" moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 368"/> Quoting-sometimes wildly out of context-various British, French and American authors such as [[John Richard Green]], [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky]], [[John Robert Seeley]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Paul Bourget]], [[Francis Delaisi]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John Burgess]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[H. G. Wells]], Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed "to further the interests of money making all over the globe".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 367-371</ref> Chamberlain's attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow "Jewish plutocrats" to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 368-371</ref> Right from the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 370-371</ref> Chamberlain wrote that America "is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 371">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 371</ref> Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|''Auswärtiges Amt'']] worked hard to prevent Chamberlain's essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 371"/> Chamberlain's wartime writings also gained much attention, albeit of a highly negative sort in his native Britain with ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' declaring: "The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 366">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981  page 366.</ref> In 1915, an unauthorised translation of Chamberlain's wartime essays was published in London under the unflattening title of ''The Ravings of a Renegade''.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 366"/>\u000a\u000aIn his 1915 pamphlet ''Deutschland und England'' (''Germany and England''), Chamberlain vigorously took the side of his adopted land against the land of his birth.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 220">Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' New York: Vintage Books page 220</ref> Chamberlain explained in ''Germany and England'' how the British were once noble Aryans like the Germans who lived in a perfect rigidly hierarchical, romantically rural "unmixed" society, but then starting in the 16th century capitalism had corrupted the English.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 220"/> Capitalism had turned the English into an urban nation dominated by a vulgar money-grubbing, philistine middle class incapable of any sort of culture.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 220"/> The beautiful English countryside, which Chamberlain claimed was once the home of an idyllic agrarian society had been replaced by an ugly urban landscape full of polluting factories owned by greedy Jewish capitalists. Even worse in Chamberlain's opinion, capitalism had led the English into a process of racial degeneration, democracy and rule by the Jews.<ref>Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' London: Vintage Books, 2000 page 220</ref> Chamberlain wrote with disgust how the sons of the English aristocracy "disappear from society to make money", leading to a warped "moral compass" on their part in contrast to Germany where the ''Junkers'' either tended to their estates or had careers in the Army.<ref name="Buruma, Ian page 220"/> Chamberlain's discussion of Britain ended with the lament that his idealised [[Merry England|"Merry Old England"]] no longer existed with Chamberlain writing:<blockquote>"We were merry, we are merry no longer. The complete decline of country life and the equally complete victory of God Mammon, the deity of Industry and Trade, have caused the true, harmless, refreshing merriness to betake itself out of England".<ref>Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' New York: Vintage Bookspages 220-221</ref></blockquote> Germany by contrast in Chamberlain's viewpoint, had preserved its racial purity and by having an authoritarian government and a welfare state, avoided both ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and Jewish rule.<ref name="Buruma, Ian pages 220-221">Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' New York: Vintage Books pages 220-221</ref> It was for this reason that Chamberlain alleged that Britain had started World War I in 1914 to destroy Germany.<ref name="Buruma, Ian pages 220-221"/> For all these reasons Chamberlain stated he had come to hate Britain and love Germany as Germany had preserved everything that Chamberlain considered to be noble in humanity while Britain had long since lost its nobility of spirit.<ref>Buruma, Ian ''Anglopmania An European Love Affair'' London: Vintage Books, 2000 pages 220-221</ref>  Chamberlain received the [[Iron Cross]] from the [[Kaiser]], with whom he was in regular correspondence, in 1916.<ref>[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]] ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', 1959, p.108 of 1985 Bookclub Associates Edition.</ref> By this time, Chamberlain's obsessive anti-Semitism had reached the point that Chamberlain was suffering from nightmares where he was kidnapped and sentenced to death by the Jews.<ref name="Friedländer, Saul page 89"/> In 1915, Chamberlain wrote proudly in a letter to a friend that: "My lawyer friend in Munich tell me there is no living being whom the Jews hate more than I."<ref name="Friedländer, Saul page 89"/> In another essay, Chamberlain wrote the "pure Germanic force" had to be saved from the "disgusting worm" (the phrase "disgusting worm" was often used by Wagner to describe the Jews).<ref name="Röhl, John page 207"/> Chamberlain wrote the purpose of this "struggle" was "salvation from the claws of the un-German and anti-German", going on to quote from Wagner's 1850 anti-Semitic essay ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' that "Against this devil's brood stands Germany as God's champion: Siegfried against the worm!".<ref name="Röhl, John page 207"/>\u000a\u000aDuring the war years, Chamberlain was one of the "annexationists" who wanted the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the ''Reich'' the "world power status" he believed it deserved.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 381-382">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 381-382</ref> As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the [[Pan-German League]], the [[German Conservative Party|Conservatives]] and the ''völkishe'' groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 381-382"/> Chamberlain was a founding member of the Independent Commission for a German Peace, and signed in July 1915 the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1, 347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 381-382"/> Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain's essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who supposedly were seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany's power that would allow the ''Reich'' to win the war.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 382">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 382</ref> In a letter to his friend [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]], Chamberlain wrote: <blockquote>"I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these things-even when they go on secretly-that the Jews are completely intoxicated by their success in Germany-first from the millions they have gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already they are beginning to lose their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 382"/></blockquote> In October\u2013November 1916, the so-called ''[[Judenzählung]]'' ("Jew count") was held by the German Army to examine the popular anti-Semitic claim that German Jews were "shirking" their duty to the Fatherland by avoiding war service.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 386-387">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 386-387</ref> The "Jew count" revealed that in fact German Jews were disproportionately over-represented in the front-line units as most German Jews were anxious to prove their German patriotism and love of the Fatherland by volunteering for front-line duty. Many young German Jewish men wished to rebut the anti-Semitic canard that they were not real Germans by fighting for the Fatherland, and thus showing that they loved Germany as much as their Gentile neighbors; hence the disproportionate number of German Jews on the front-line compared to their share of the German population.<ref>Wette, Wolfram ''The Wehrmacht'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006 pages 34- 37.</ref> As the results of the "Jew count" did not please the two men in charge of High Command, namely Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff]], the latter a "fanatical anti-Semite" who had been expecting the "Jew Count" to reveal that German Jews were disproportionally underrepresented on the front-line, the High Command issued a facetious statement saying that for the safety of the German Jewish community the "Jew count" could not be made public as it would endanger the lives of German Jews.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 386-387"/><ref>Wette, Wolfram ''The Wehrmacht'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006 page 37.</ref> The implication that if people could see just how far German Jews were allegedly "shirking" their duty to the Fatherland, then pogroms would break out in Germany led to a major upsurge in anti-Semitism, which Chamberlain was quick to exploit.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 387</ref>\u000a\u000aIn support of a harder line both in the war and on the home front, Chamberlain involved himself in the intrigues to oust Dr. [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] as Chancellor and replace him with the "hard man", Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]].<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 383">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 383</ref> In Chamberlain's opinion, if only Germany were to wage the war more ruthlessly and brutally, then the war would be won.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 383-384</ref> Chamberlain loathed Bethmann-Hollweg whom he saw as an inept leader who simply did not have the will to win.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 381"/> Chamberlain had an unbounded confidence in the ability of the Army and Navy to win the war, but on the home front, Chamberlain believed the ''Reich'' was "leaderless" as he viewed Bethmann-Hollweg as a Jewish "puppet" unwilling and unable to stop defeatism, corruption or the demand for more democracy.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 382"/> Besides supporting Tirptiz as Chancellor, Chamberlain was all for adopting unrestricted submarine warfare-even at the risk of provoking the United States into the war-as the best way of starving Britain into surrender.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 384">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 384</ref> Chamberlain was also a very public supporter of Zeppelin raids to destroy British cities.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 384"/> After a discussion with his friend and admirer, Count  [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], Chamberlain published a newspaper essay in July 1915 complaining that the government had imposed far too much restrictions on Zeppelin raids to save innocent British lives, and he argued that his country should bomb British cities with no concern for lives of civilians as ordinary British people deserved to die.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 384"/>\u000a\u000aThe campaign by the annexationists against Bethmann Hollweg was in large part motivated by the fact that the annexationists believed that Bethmann Hollweg was not one of them. Had Chamberlain or any of the other annexationists been aware of the secret September Programme of 1914, where Bethmann Hollweg planned to announce his intentions for annexing much of Europe and Africa after the soon to be expected fall of Paris, they would had a different opinion of Bethmann Hollweg.<ref name="Fraser pages 410-424">Fraser, David "Houston Stewart Chamberlain Revolutionary or Reactionary?" pages 410-424 from ''Journal of 20th Century History'', Volume 20, #1, January 1990 page 417</ref> Under the constitution of 1871, the ''Reichstag'' had limited powers, but one of those was the right to vote on the budget. In the 1912 ''Reichstag'' elections, the anti-militarist Social Democrats had won the largest number of seats in the ''Reichstag''. Thus Bethmann Hollweg had to work with the SPD to get the budgets passed to finance the war.<ref name="Fraser pages 410-424"/> In August 1914, the government had been able to persuade the majority of the SPD to support the war under the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany.<ref name="Fraser pages 410-424"/> The SPD broke into two; the Majority Social Democrats supported the war while the minority Independent Social Democrats stayed true to their pacifistic beliefs and opposed the war. The Majority Social Democrats agreed to support the war to the extent it was portrayed as a defensive struggle against Russia, but the Majority SPD wanted nothing to do with the annexationists.<ref name="Fraser pages 410-424"/>  Hence, Bethmann Hollweg's refusal to support the annexationists in public was due to pragmatic political considerations, namely his need for Majority Social Democratic co-operation in the ''Reichstag'' as opposed to being against the annexationists as Chamberlain mistakenly believed.<ref>Fraser, David "Houston Stewart Chamberlain Revolutionary or Reactionary?" pages 410-424 from ''Journal of 20th Century History'', Volume 20, #1, January 1990 page 418</ref> If the parties supporting annexationists such as the Conservatives, National Liberals and Free Conservatives had done better in the 1912 elections instead as poorly as they did, Bethmann Hollweg would almost certainly had taken a different line in public regarding the demands of the annexationists.<ref>Fraser, David "Houston Stewart Chamberlain Revolutionary or Reactionary?" pages 410-424 from ''Journal of 20th Century History'', Volume 20, #1, January 1990 page 418</ref> Much of Chamberlain's strident, aggressive and embittered rhetoric reflected the fact that the annexationists were a minority in Germany, albeit a vocal, well organized and large minority with many influential members inside and outside the government, but a minority nonetheless.<ref>Fraser, David "Houston Stewart Chamberlain Revolutionary or Reactionary?" pages 410-424 from ''Journal of 20th Century History'', Volume 20, #1, January 1990 page 419</ref> The majority of the German people did not support the annexationists.<ref>Fraser, David "Houston Stewart Chamberlain Revolutionary or Reactionary?" pages 410-424 from ''Journal of 20th Century History'', Volume 20, #1, January 1990 page 419</ref> Chamberlain regarded the refusal of the democratic parties like the left-wing SPD, the right-of-the-centre ''Zentrum'' and the liberal Progressives to join the annexationist movement as essentially high treason. In August 1916, there occurred to what amounted to a military coup d'état when Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff]] informed Wilhelm and Bethmann Hollweg that henceforward the Army would not longer obey either the Kaiser or the government, and that from now the Emperor and the Chancellor would now obey the Army. In July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff had Bethmann Hollweg dismissed and replaced with [[Georg Michaelis]] as Chancellor. Chamberlain's preferred candidate as Chancellor, Admiral Tirpitz was passed over. Tirpitz was an intelligent, media-savvy, charismatic political intriguer with a desperate hunger for political power, and the duumvirate of Hindenburg and Ludendorff regarded Tirpitz as Chancellor as too much of a threat to their own power. In response, to the firing of Bethmann Hollweg, the democratic parties decided to protest by passing a peace resolution. The [[Reichstag Peace Resolution]] of July 1917 where the SPD, ''Zentrum'' and the Progressives all joined forces to vote for a resolution asking the government to start peace talks at once on the basis of return to the status quo of 1914 "inflamed the paranoia and desperation of the right. The annexationists prepared for a war to the knife against the Chancellor and domestic "traitors"".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 388">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 388</ref> Chamberlain was disappointed that Tirpitz was not appointed Chancellor, but however, he was overjoyed with Bethmann Hollweg's sacking, and welcomed the military dictatorship of Hindenburg and Ludendorff as giving Germany the sort of government it needed.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 389</ref> Chamberlain was always inclined to hero worship, and for him, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were the greatest of a long line of German heroes.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389"/> Chamberlain wrote in 1917 that: "Had Hindenburg and Ludendorff stood on the first day in their rightful place, the peace would in all probability have been dictated in Paris before the end of 1914".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389"/>\u000a\u000aBesides for one being of the annexationists who wanted to see the war ending with Germany as the world's greatest power, Chamberlain also advocated a set of wide-ranging changes to German society intended to achieve a "rebirth" of Germany.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 377">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 377</ref> Chamberlain wanted to see the [[Spirit of 1914]] made permanent, to convert the wartime ''Burgfrieden'' ("peace within a castle under siege") into a peacetime ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]''  (people's community).<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 377"/> Chamberlain wanted a new economic and social system that would be a "third way" between capitalism and socialism to bring about the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' organized along [[Corporatism|corporatist]] lines.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 371"/> To achieve this, Chamberlain called for the end of what democratic aspects the constitution of 1871 possessed and the creation of a pure dictatorship; for end of the capitalist system with the state to nationalize huge sections of the economy while at the same time respecting the right to private property; and for the militarization of society on a new scale.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 371-377</ref> Chamberlain was somewhat vague about how this corporatist society would work in practice, but what he wanted was rule by an oligarchy of aristocrats, intellectuals, bureaucrats and military officers who would run a "planned economy" via "scientific management".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 373-374">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 373-374</ref> The entire German people (except for the Jews, whom Chamberlain believed did not belong in Germany) were to united by a common loyalty to the Emperor. A fanatical monarchist, Chamberlain saw the monarchy as the bedrock of German life, writing in his 1915 book ''Politische Ideale'': "Whoever speaks of a republic in Germany belongs on the gallows; the monarchical idea is here a holy law of life".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 372.</ref> At the same time, Chamberlain envisioned a Germany that would somehow remain the leading industrial power at the forefront of modern technology while at the same time become a romantic, agrarian society where ordinary people would work the land and retain their traditional deference to the aristocracy.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 pages 371-373</ref> Chamberlain was very vague and nebulous about this could be achieved, writing only that the a "planned economy", "scientific management" and an economically interventionist state committed to social reforms would make it all possible.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey pages 373-374"/>\u000a\u000aAfter's Germany diplomatic defeat in the [[Second Moroccan Crisis]] in 1911, Wilhelm II became the "Shadow Emperor", an increasing reclusive figure who was seen less and less in public. The war further reinforced Wilhelm's tendency to avoid the public spotlight as much as possible. In private, Chamberlain grew disillusioned with his friend, complaining that instead of being the "Aryan soldier king" leading the ''Reich'' to victory as he wanted and expected him to be, the Kaiser was a weak leader and the "Shadow Emperor" who was hiding himself away in deep seclusion from the rest of Germany at his hunting lodges.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 382"/> Wilhelm's hiding himself away from his own people during the war did immense damage to the prestige of the monarchy, and if the Kaiser's seclusion did not make the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] of 1918 inevitable, it at least made it possible. As a monarchist, Chamberlain was worried about how Wilhelm was hurting his own reputation, and often urged to no avail for the Kaiser to appear in public more often. Chamberlain wrote in 1916 that Wilhelm had an "absolute incapability for judging character" and was now being "forced to obey a Frankfurt pimp", the last being a disparaging reference to Bethmann Hollweg.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 382"/> Chamberlain was always very careful to avoid attacking Wilhelm in public, but his violent press attacks against Bethmann Hollweg caused something of a rift with the Kaiser who felt Chamberlain's very public criticism of the Chancellor was also an indirect attack on himself.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 383"/> Nonetheless, despite the strains the war imposed on their friendship, Chamberlain and Wilhelm continued to write throughout the war, but pointy did not meet in person anymore, through Chamberlain's increasing paralysis also played a part. Wilhelm wrote to Chamberlain on 15 January 1917, stating: <blockquote>"The war is a struggle between two ''Weltanschauugen'', the Teutonic-German for morality, right, loyalty and faith, genuine humanity, truth and real freedom, against...the worship of Mammon, the power of money, pleasure, land-hunger, lies, betrayal, deceit and-last but not least-treacherous assassination! These two ''Weltanschauugen'' cannot be reconciled or tolerate one another, one must be ''victorious'', the other must ''go under''!"<ref>Röhl, John ''The Kaiser and His Court'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 208.</ref></blockquote> In response, Chamberlain wrote back to Wilhelm on 20 January 1917, where he declared: <blockquote>"England has fallen totally into the hands of the Jews and the Americans. A person does not understand this war unless he realizes that it is in the deepest sense the war of ''Judentum'' and its near relative Americanism for the control of the world-a war against Christianity, against ''Bildung'', moral strength, uncommercial art, against every idealist perspective on life, and for the benefit of a world that would include only industry, finance, and trade-in short, unrestricted plutocracy. All the other additional factors-Russian greed, French vanity, Italian bombast, the envious and cowardly spirit of the neutrals-are whipped up, made crazy; the Jew and the Yankee are the driving forces that operate consciously and in a certain sense have hitherto been victorious or at all events successful...It is the war of modern mechanized "civilization" against the ancient, holy and continually reborn culture of chosen races. Machines will crush both spirit and soul in their clutches".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page384</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aChamberlain continued to believe right up until the end of the war that Germany would win only if the people willed victory enough and this sort of ideological war between "German idealism" vs. "Jewish materialism" could only end with one side utterly crushing the other.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 388"/> In the last two years of the war, Chamberlain become obsessed with defeating the "inner enemy" that he believed was holding Germany back.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389"/> In this regard, Chamberlain frequently asserted that Germany was not one nation, but two; on one side, the "patriots"  like Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], General [[Erich Ludendorff]], Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]], [[Wolfgang Kapp]], [[J. F. Lehmann]] and [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow|Count von Reventlow]] and on the other the "traitors" which included people like [[Philipp Scheidemann]], [[Eduard David]] and [[Matthias Erzberger]].<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389"/> No compromise between these two Germanies was possible or desirable Chamberlain argued, and one would have to be destroyed.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389"/> Chamberlain's wartime writings against the "inner enemy" anticipated the "stab-in-the-back legend" which emerged after 1918. Chamberlain was a founding member of both the extreme-right, anti-Semitic ''Deutschlands Erneuerung'' newspaper, and of the [[German Fatherland Party|Fatherland Party]] in 1917.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 389"/> The character of the Fatherland Party was well illustrated by an infamous incident in January 1918 when at Fatherland Party rally in Berlin, a group of disabled war veterans were invited to debate the Fatherland Party's speakers.<ref name="Evans, Richard J. page 68">Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', London: Penguin Books, 2005 page 68.</ref> The wounded veterans, which included men who were paralyzed, blinded, missing limbs, etc. all declared that they were now against the war and become pacifists.<ref name="Evans, Richard J. page 68"/> The crippled veterans deplored the Fatherland Party's militarism and demand for war for to go until victory, regardless of how many more would have to die or end up living with destroyed bodies.<ref name="Evans, Richard J. page 68"/> The ultra-nationalists of the Fatherland Party were so enraged by what the crippled veterans had to say that the audience stormed the stage, and savagely beat the disabled veterans senselessly.<ref name="Evans, Richard J. page 68"/> Chamberlain who lived in Bayreuth was not present during the Berlin rally, but expressed his approval of what happened when he heard of it.\u000a\u000aDuring the war, most Germans saw Britain as the main enemy, and so Chamberlain's status as the Englishman who supported the ''Reich'' made him an even more famous celebrity in Germany than he had been before 1914.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 366</ref> Chamberlain's wartime essays were widely read.

In March 1920, Chamberlain had supported the [[Kapp Putsch]] against the [[Weimar Republic]] which he called the ''Judenrepublik'' ("Jewish Republic"), and was even more embittered by the failure of the Kapp Putsch.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 417">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist  of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 417</ref> The Kapp putsch was defeated by a general strike called by the Social Democrats which shut down the entire German economy. A young ''völkisch'' activist Josef Stolzing-Cerny and a Chamberlain protégé who had participated in the Kapp putsch wrote to Chamberlain after its failure: "Unfortunately Kapp was not all 'the man with the lion heart', much rather the man with the beer heart, for he continually used all his energies befuddling his brain with alcohol...In the same situation a Bismarck or a Napoleon would have hunted the whole Jewish-socialist republic to the devil."<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 417"/> Stolzing-Cerny went on to criticize Kapp for not unleashing the ''[[Freikorps]]'' [[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt]] which had taken Berlin against the Jews of Berlin, instead ordering the ''Freikorps'' to keep order.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 417"/> After the failure of the putsch, Chamberlain no longer considered [[Wolfgang Kapp]] to be one of his heroes, and instead damned him as a weak-willed coward all too typical of German conservatives who talked tough, but never followed up their words with action.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 417"/> More importantly, the failure of the Kapp putsch to a certain extent discredited traditional German conservatism in Chamberlain's eyes, and led him on the search for a more radical alternative, a type of "German socialism" that would offer a "third way" between capitalism and socialism.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist  of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 419</ref> In January 1921, Stolzing-Cerny who joined the NSDAP in December 1920 wrote to Chamberlain about the new man on the political scene, "one Adolf Hitler, an Austrian worker, a man of extraordinary oratorical talents and an astonishingly rich political knowledge who knows marvelously how to thrill the masses".<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist  of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 421</ref> Initially, Chamberlain was hesitant about Hitler, believing that he might be another Kapp, but after the "battle of Coburg", where Hitler had personally fought with his followers in a street battle against the Communists, Chamberlain started to see Hitler as someone who practiced what he preached.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 422">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist  of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 422</ref> From that time onwards, Chamberlain started to closely follow and admire Hitler, whom he saw as "Germany's savior".<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 422"/> Hitler in his turn had read ''The Foundations'', Chamberlain's biography of Wagner and many of his wartime essays, and was much influenced by all that Chamberlain had written.<ref>Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist  of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 452</ref> Hitler's biographer, the British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]]  wrote that "...Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well known anti-Semitic tracts such as those by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, [[Adolf Wahrmund]] and especially, the arch-popularizer [[Theodor Fritsch]] (one of whose emphasis was the alleged sexual abuse of women by the Jews)...".<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler Hubris'', New York: Norton, 1998 page 151</ref> The fact that Hitler was an ardent Wagnerite who adored Wagner's music gave Chamberlain and Hitler a mutual ground for friendship beyond their shared hatred of the Jews.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 422"/> Likewise, [[Joseph Goebbels]] had been converted to the ''völkisch'' ideology after reading Chamberlain's books and essays, and come to the conclusion on the basis of Chamberlain's writings that the West could only be saved by removing the Jews from German society.<ref>Evans, Richard J.

It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding or vague, provisional statements...but the result of this is that he is decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian called him "the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of statecraft". I believe...we are all inclined to view those things as impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, even murderous influence of Jewry on the German ''Volk'' and not to take action; if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; nobody except Hitler...This man has worked like a divine blessing, cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening their courage and resoluteness.

His reception was particularly favourable among Germany's conservative elite. [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] patronised Chamberlain, maintaining a correspondence, inviting him to stay at his court, distributing copies of ''The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century'' among the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], and seeing that ''The Foundations'' was carried in German libraries and included in the school curricula.<ref name="CHASE"/><ref name=NaziSources>{{cite book\u000a |last=Stackelberg |first=R. |author2=S.A.

He translated them from the language of harmless snobberty into of a modernized, seductive mysticism."<ref>Ossietzky, Carl von "Anti-Semites" pages 276-280 from ''The Weimar Republic Sourcebook'' edited by Anton Kaes, Martin Jay and Edward Dimendberg, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994 page 280.</ref> Ossietzky ended his essay with the warning: "Today there is a strong smell of blood in the air.

If it did not form the framework of later [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ideology, at the very least it provided its adherents with a seeming intellectual justification.<ref>Mosse, xvi.</ref> Much of Chamberlain's ideas such as his emphasis on a racial struggle between Aryans vs. Jews for world domination; his championing of "world power status" for Germany; his call for a "planned economy" (something realized in 1936 when Hitler brought in the First [[Four Year Plan]] which saw the German state take over the economy); his vision of Germany becoming the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community"); his demand for a "third way" between capitalism and socialism; his total opposition to democracy and his nostalgia for an agrarian lifestyle were central to National Socialism.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 449">Field, Geoffrey ''The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 449</ref> However, there were differences in that Chamberlain was always a monarchist and he believed that when his friend Hitler came to power, he would restore the monarchy and put his other friend Wilhelm II back on the throne.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 449"/> Had Chamberlain lived to see the Third Reich, he likely would have been disappointed that Hitler did not carry out the restoration of the monarchy that he so desired. Moreover, Chamberlain was just one of the many ''völkische'' thinkers who influenced Hitler.<ref name="Field, Geoffrey page 449"/>\u000a\u000aChamberlain himself lived to see his ideas begin to bear fruit. [[Adolf Hitler]], while still growing as a political figure in Germany, visited him several times (in 1923 and in 1926, together with [[Joseph Goebbels]]) at the Wagner family's property in [[Bayreuth]].<ref name= NaziSources/> Hitler later attended Chamberlain's funeral in January 1927 along with several highly ranked members of the Nazi Party.<ref>{{cite news |title=Der Todestag des Schriftstellers Houston Stewart Chamberlain, 9.

Bored, he went to a book shelf, picked up a copy of Chamberlain's ''The Foundations'' and wrote of the moment: "I felt electrified; I wrote down the title and went straight to the bookshop."
