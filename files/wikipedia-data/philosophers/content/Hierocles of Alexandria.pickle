V'''Hierocles of Alexandria''' ({{lang-el|\u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2}}) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Neoplatonist]] writer who was active around AD 430.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aHe studied under [[Plutarch of Athens|Plutarch]] (the Neoplatonist) at [[Athens]] in the early 5th century, and taught for some years in his native city.<ref name="eb1911">{{1911}}</ref> He seems to have been banished from [[Alexandria]] and to have taken up his abode in [[Constantinople]], where he gave such offence that he was thrown into prison and flogged.<ref name="eb1911"/> The causes of this are not recorded.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000aThe only complete work of his which has been preserved is the commentary on the [[The golden verses of Pythagoras|''Chrysa Epe'' (''Golden Verses'') of Pythagoras]].<ref name="eb1911"/> It enjoyed a great reputation in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], and there are numerous translations in various European languages.<ref name="eb1911"/> Several other writings, especially one on providence and fate, a consolatory treatise dedicated to his patron [[Olympiodorus of Thebes]], are quoted or referred to by [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] and [[Stobaeus]].<ref name="eb1911"/> Hierocles argued against astrological fatalism on the basis that it is supported by an irrational necessity rather than a divine, rational [[Providence of God]].<ref name="iep">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/astr-hel.htm#SH7e Hierocles], Hellenistic Astrology, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> For the same reason, he opposed theurgic and magic practices as they were attempts to supersede the divine providential order.<ref name="iep"/>\u000a\u000aAlthough he never mentions [[Christianity]] in his surviving works, his writings have been taken as an attempt at reconciliation between Greek religion traditions and the Christian beliefs he may have encountered in Constantinople.<ref>{{cite DCBL|wstitle=Hierocles of Alexandria, a philosopher |first=J. R.|last=Mozley}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThe collection of some 260 witticisms attributed to Hierocles and Philagrius has no connection with Hierocles of Alexandria, but is probably a compilation of later date, founded on two older collections.<ref name="eb1911"/> It is now agreed that the fragments of the Elements of Ethics preserved in [[Stobaeus]] are from a work by a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] named [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]], contemporary of [[Epictetus]], who has been identified with the "Hierocles Stoicus vir sanctus et gravis" in [[Aulus Gellius]] (ix. 5. 8).<ref name="eb1911"/> This theory is confirmed by the discovery of a [[papyrus]] (ed. H. von Arnim in Berliner Kiassikertexte, Iv. 1906.)<ref name="eb1911"/>\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a* Hermann S.
