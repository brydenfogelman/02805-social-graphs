She begins by basing her theory of gender performativity on a feminist phenomenological point of view. She suggests that both phenomenology and feminism ground their theories in "lived experience".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|last = Butler|first = Judith|date = 17 November 2015|journal = Theatre Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> Further, in comparing phenomenologist [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]], Butler argues that both theories view the sexual body as a historical idea or situation; she accepts this notion of a "distinction between sex, as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation or signification of that facticity".<ref name=":0" /> This combination of theories is essential for founding Butler's view of "theatrical" or performative genders in society.\u000a\u000aButler argues that it is more valid to perceive gender as a performance in which an individual agent acts. The performative element of her theory suggests a social audience. For Butler, the "script" of gender performance is effortlessly transmitted generation to generation in the form of socially established "meanings": She states, "gender is not a radical choice... [nor is it] imposed or inscribed upon the individual".<ref name=":0" /> Given the social nature of human beings, most actions are witnessed, reproduced, and internalized and thus take on a performative or theatric quality. Currently, the actions appropriate for men and women have been transmitted to produce a social atmosphere that both maintains and legitimizes a seemingly natural gender binary.<ref name=":0" /> Consistent with her acceptance of the body as a historical idea, she suggests that our concept of gender is seen as natural or innate because the body "becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time".<ref name=":0" />\u000a\u000aButler argues that the performance of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender to the performance of the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the fact that there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.\u000a\u000aButler uses [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of how a person's identity is modeled in terms of the normal. She revises Freud's notion of this concept's applicability to lesbianism, where Freud says that lesbians are modeling their behavior on men, the perceived normal or ideal. She instead says that all gender works in this way of performativity and a representing of an internalized notion of gender norms.<ref>Rivkin, Julie, and Michael Ryan.

These stylized bodily acts, in their repetition, establish the appearance of an essential, [[ontology|ontological]] "core" gender.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This is the sense in which Butler famously theorizes gender, along with sex and sexuality, as [[performative]]. The performance of gender, sex, and sexuality, however, is not a voluntary choice for Butler, who locates the construction of the gendered, sexed, desiring subject within what she calls, borrowing from Foucault's ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', "regulative [[discourse]]s." These, also called "frameworks of intelligibility" or "disciplinary regimes," decide in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or "natural."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Regulative discourse includes within it [[Discipline and Punish#Discipline|disciplinary techniques]] which, by coercing subjects to perform specific stylized actions, maintain the appearance in those subjects of the "core" gender, sex and sexuality the discourse itself produces.<ref>Butler explicitly formulates her theory of [[performativity]] in the final pages of ''Gender Trouble'', specifically in the final section of her chapter "Subversive Bodily Acts" entitled "Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions" and elaborates performativity in relation to the question of political agency in her conclusion, "From Parody to Politics." See {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=171\u201390 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}</ref>\u000a\u000aA significant yet sometimes overlooked part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of "natural" or coherent gender and sexuality. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex, reconceiving the sexed body as itself culturally constructed by regulative discourse.<ref>For Butler's critique of biological accounts of sexual difference as a ruse for the cultural construction of "natural" sex, see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=135\u201341 |chapter=Concluding Unscientific Postscript |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}</ref> The supposed obviousness of sex as a natural biological fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a "natural" and unquestioned "fact," is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, unavoidably more cultural in their appearance, which can purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of a more fundamental sex. On Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural.<ref>For Butler's discussion of the performative co-construction of sex and gender see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=163\u201371, 177\u20138 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}} The signification of sex is also addressed in connection with [[Monique Wittig]] in the section "Monique Wittig: Bodily Disintegrations and Fictive Sex," pp. 141\u201363</ref> In this way, Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the [[sex/gender distinction]] as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]] will be ineffective.<ref>For Butler's problematization of the [[sex/gender distinction]] see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=9\u201311, 45\u20139 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThus, by showing the terms "gender" and "sex" as socially and culturally constructed, Butler offers a critique of both terms, even as they have been used by feminists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judith Butler|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t306.e100&srn=1&ssid=460269119#FIRSTHIT|publisher=Oxford reference Online Premium}}</ref> Butler argued that feminism made a mistake in trying to make "women" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler said this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations because it allows for two distinct categories: men and women.  Butler believes that feminists should not try to define "women" and she also believes that feminists should "focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement."<ref>{{cite web|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be "flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of [[Queer theory]].\u000a\u000a=== "Imitation and Gender Insubordination" (1990)===\u000aJudith Butler explores the production of identities such as "homosexual" and "heterosexual" and the limiting nature of identity categories. An identity category for her is a result of certain exclusions and concealments, and thus a site of regulation. However, Butler also acknowledges that categorized identities are important for political action at present times. An important idea in this work is also that identity forms through repetition of acts or imitation and not due to a certain original identity that exists prior to repetition. Imitation gives the illusion of continuity to produce identities. In the same way, heterosexual identity, which is set up as an ideal, requires constant "compulsive" repetition to protect the very identity repetition has created.<ref>Butler, Judith.

And this repetition is not performed ''by'' a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance. This concept is linked to Butler's discussion of performativity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex" |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=95 |isbn=0-415-90365-3}}</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aIterability, in its endless ''un''determinedness as to-be-determinedness, is thus precisely that aspect of performativity that makes the production of the "natural" sexed, gendered, heterosexual subject possible, while also and at the same time opening that subject up to the possibility of its incoherence and contestation.{{Technical statement|date=July 2011}}\u000a\u000a===''Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative'' (1997)===\u000a{{Main article|Performativity#Judith Butler's perspective on performativity}}\u000a\u000aIn ''Excitable Speech'', Butler surveys the problems of [[hate speech]] and censorship. She argues that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.<ref name="Jagger">{{cite book |last=Jagger|first=Gill |title=Judith Butler: Sexual politics, social change and the power of the performative |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=115\u20138 |isbn=978-0-415-21975-4}}</ref> She develops a new conception of censorship's complex workings, supplanting the myth of the independent subject who wields the power to censor with a theory of censorship as an effect of state power and, more primordially, as the condition of language and [[discourse]] itself. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\u000a\u000aButler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\u000a\u000aDeploying [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s argument from the first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=129\u201333 |isbn=0-415-91588-0}}</ref> As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality it sought to control.<ref>For example, {{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink=Michel Foucault |others=Trans.

There was installed [since the 17th century] rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy.}}</ref> Extending this argument using [[Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic ''I'' is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; "If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech".<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | page=140 |isbn=0-415-91588-0}}</ref>\u000a\u000aButler also questions the efficacy of censorship on the grounds that hate speech is context-dependent. Citing [[J.L. Austin]]'s concept of the [[performative utterance]], Butler notes that words' ability to "do things" makes hate speech possible but also at the same time dependent on its specific embodied context. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Austin's claim that what a word ''does'', its [[illocutionary force]], varies with the context in which it is uttered implies that it is impossible to adequately define the performative meanings of words, including hate, abstractly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On this basis, Butler rejects arguments like [[Richard Delgado]]'s which justify the censorship of certain specific words by claiming the use of those words constitutes hate speech in any context. In this way, Butler underlines the difficulty inherent in efforts to systematically identify hate speech.\u000a\u000a===''Undoing Gender'' (2004)===\u000a''[[Undoing Gender]]'' collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of her other books. Butler revisits and refines her notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing "restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life".\u000a\u000aButler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". She argues that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if his or her desires differ from normality. She states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.<ref>Butler, Judith (2004). Undoing Gender. New York: Routledge</ref>\u000a\u000aIn her discussion of intersex, Butler addresses the case of [[David Reimer]], a person whose sex was medically "reassigned" from male to female after a botched [[circumcision]] at eight months of age. Reimer was "made" female by doctors, but later in life identified as "really" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl'', which he wrote with John Colapinto.

Primarily borrowing from [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean Laplanche]], [[Adriana Cavarero]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. She theorizes the subject in relation to the social \u2013 a community of others and their norms \u2013 which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical "I", in the first place.\u000a\u000aButler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.\u000a\u000a{{cquote|"You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking "I" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final "irresponsibility," one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament" (page 78).}}\u000a\u000aInstead she argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\u000a\u000a==Reception==\u000a[[File:Adorno-preis-2012-judith-butler-ffm-287.jpg|thumb|Butler receives the [[Theodor W.

For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like "gender politics" and "gender violence" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the USA can "[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialised urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work", and produce instead "a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out".<ref>{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | page= 72 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250}}</ref> Nevertheless, both Namaste and Laurie acknowledge the enduring importance of Butler's critical contributions to the study of gender identities.\u000a\u000a==Political activism==\u000aMuch of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and she served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]].

My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left.
