He was awarded from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in mathematics: the BA (1932), MA (1933), and Ph.D. (1935). His Ph.D. thesis, on [[complex analysis]], was titled ''Some results in the theory of [[Schlicht function]]s''.\u000a\u000aIn 1941, Robinson married his former student [[Julia Robinson|Julia Bowman]]. She became his Berkeley colleague and the first woman president of the [[American Mathematical Society]].\u000a\u000aRobinson worked on [[mathematical logic]], [[set theory]], [[geometry]], [[number theory]], and [[combinatorics]]. In 1937 he set out a simpler and more conventional version of the [[John von Neumann]] 1923 [[Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013Gödel set theory|axiomatic set theory]]. Soon after [[Alfred Tarski]] joined Berkeley's mathematics department in 1942, Robinson began to do major work on the [[foundations of mathematics]], building on Tarski's concept of "essential undecidability," by proving a number of mathematical theories [[decision problem|undecidable]]. In 1950 Robinson proved that an essentially undecidable theory need not have an infinite number of [[axiom]]s by coming up with a counterexample: [[Robinson arithmetic Q|Robinson arithmetic]] ''Q''. ''Q'' is finitely axiomatizable because it lacks [[Peano arithmetic]]'s axiom schema of [[mathematical induction|induction]]; nevertheless ''Q'', like Peano arithmetic, is [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem|incomplete]] and undecidable in the sense of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]. Robinson's work on undecidability culminated in his coauthoring Tarski et al. (1953), which established, among other things, the undecidability of [[group theory]], [[lattice theory]], abstract [[projective geometry]], and [[closure algebra]]s.\u000a\u000aRobinson worked in [[number theory]], even employing very early computers to obtain results. For example, he coded the [[Lucas-Lehmer primality test]] to determine whether 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 was prime for all prime ''n'' < 2304 on a [[SWAC (computer)|SWAC]]. In 1952, he showed that these Mersenne numbers were all composite except for 17 values of ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281. He discovered the last five of these [[Mersenne prime]]s, the largest ones known at the time.\u000a\u000aRobinson wrote several papers on tilings of the plane, in particular a clear and remarkable 1971 paper "Undecidability and nonperiodicity for tilings of the plane" simplifying what had been a tangled theory.\u000a\u000aRobinson became a full professor at Berkeley in 1949, retired in 1973, and remained active in his educational interests for the duration of his life having published late in his life:\u000a* (age 80 years)  "[[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]]'s small universal Turing machine," describing a [[universal Turing machine|universal]] [[Turing machine]] with four symbols and seven states;\u000a* (age 83 years) "Two figures in the [[hyperbolic plane]]."\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a\u000a*[[Robinson arithmetic]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a* {{Citation |last=Robinson |first=R.
