Novak taught at [[Stanford University]] from 1965 to 1968, during the key years of student revolt throughout California.  During this period, he wrote ''A Time to Build'' (1967), discussing problems of belief and unbelief, [[ecumenism]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[war]].

His book ''Politics: Realism and Imagination'' includes accounts of visiting American Vietnam War deserters in France ("Desertion"), the birth and development of the student movement at Stanford ("Green Shoots of Counter-Culture") and philosophical essays on [[nihilism]] and [[Marxism]].\u000a\u000a== SUNY Old Westbury ==\u000aNovak left Stanford for a post as dean of a new "experimental" school at the newly founded [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]], [[Long Island]].\u000a\u000aNovak's writings during this period included the philosophical essay ''The Experience of Nothingness'' (1970, republished in 1998), in which he cautioned the New Left that utopianism could lead to alienation and rootlessness<!-- Suggestion: "and detailed the experience of formlessness that had become common in the West"? -->.

He wrote that "the family is the human race's natural defense against utopianism." (''The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism'')\u000a* He states that religion can 'thrive only in a personal universe' and not universities or companies, and that Western Humanism, which he states is the leading belief system of most of academia, does not ask "the fundamental questions about the meaning and limits of personal experience" and that "they leave aside the mysteries of contingency and transitoriness, for the certainties of research, production, consumption." ("God in the Colleges," ''A New Generation: American and Catholic'' (1964))\u000a* Novak states that the [[Holy Trinity]] and God are often thought of in abstract and impersonal terms in philosophy, and that they should be "thought of as a Communion of Divine Persons\u2014radiating his presence throughout creation, calling unworthy human beings to be his friends, and infusing into them his love so that they might love with it." (From \u201cThe Love That Moves the Sun,\u201d in ''A Free Society Reader'')\u000a* On December 12, 2007 Novak declared his support for the presidential candidacy of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Mitt Romney]].<ref name=romney>{{cite news| last=Novak| first=Michael| title=Why I Decided to Support Mitt Romney| date=2007-12-12| accessdate=2009-10-20| publisher=[[National Review]] | url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTc5NjdiNWVhNThmZDJhZWYwMzM4ZmIyNjgxM2MwODI=}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a* ''Social Justice Isn't What You Think It Is'' (2015)\u000a* ''Writing from Left to Right: My Journey From Liberal to Conservative'' (2013)\u000a* ''The Myth of Romantic Love and Other Essays'' (with Elizabeth Shaw) (2012)\u000a* ''Living the Call: An Introduction to the Lay Vocation'' (with William E.
