V'''Herman Johan "Hans" Achterhuis''' (born September 1, 1942, [[Hengelo]])<ref>http://personenencyclopedie.info/A/Achi/ACHTERHUIS,%20Herman%20Johan/view</ref> is Professor Emeritus in Systematic Philosophy at the [[University of Twente]], The Netherlands and one of the country's foremost philosophers. For now his research concerns particularly social and [[political philosophy]] and [[philosophy of technology]].\u000a\u000aHis list of publications shows a great scope (in fields of medical care, labour, third-world-philosophy). In 1967 he took his doctoral degree on [[Albert Camus]].\u000a\u000aHis latest books handle the topics of utopianism (\u2018De erfenis van de utopie\u2019, \u2018The Legacy of Utopia\u2019) and the tension between morality and politics in relation to the Kosovo War (\u201cPolitiek van Goede bedoelingen\u2019, \u2018Policy of good intentions\u2019). He is co-author of the volume American Philosophy of Technology; The Empirical Turn. This work includes contributions on [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Don Ihde]] and [[Langdon Winner]].\u000a\u000a== Main thoughts ==\u000a\u000aHis ideas add up to a philosophy of things ([[object (philosophy)|objects]]) and a plea for a [[morality]] of [[machines]]. Rather than being morally neutral, things guide our behaviour (barriers in the subway forcing us to buy a ticket). This is why they are capable of exerting moral pressure that is much more effective than imposing sanctions or trying to reform the way people think. Utopia has been superseded but the world can still be improved, if we take seriously our moral ties to the machines and devices that surround us.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosopher Laureate ==\u000aIn 2011 Achterhuis was chosen as the first [[Philosopher Laureate of the Netherlands]]. This honorary title was an initiative of the Magazine [[Filosofie]], and the [[Philosophy Month Foundation]] (Stichting Maand van de Filosofie), together with the newspaper [[Trouw]]. The person is chosen by a group of journalists and academics. The aim of the initiative  is to allow a philosophy heavyweight to speak in the media, to place news events in a broader context. In 2013 Achterhuis was succeeded as Philosopher Laureate by [[René Gude]] (Soerabaja, 2 March 1957 \u2013 Amsterdam, 13 March 2015).\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000a*Achterhuis, H.J.
