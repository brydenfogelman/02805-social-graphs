Negri founded the ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' (Worker Power) group in 1969 and was a leading member of  ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]''. As one of the most popular theorists of [[Autonomism]], he has published hugely influential books urging "revolutionary consciousness."\u000a\u000aHe was accused in the late 1970s of various charges including being the mastermind of the left-wing [[urban guerrilla]] organization<ref name="portelli"/> [[Red Brigades]] (''Brigate Rosse'' or BR), involved in the May 1978 kidnapping of [[Aldo Moro]], two-time Prime Minister of Italy, and leader of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy, historical)|Christian-Democrat Party]], among others. Voice evidence suggested Negri made a threatening phone call on behalf of the BR, but the court was unable to conclusively prove his ties.<ref name="portelli"/> The question of Negri's complicity with left-wing extremism is a controversial subject.<ref name=drake>Drake, Richard.

His father was an active communist, and although the father died when Negri was two years old, his political engagement made Negri familiar with [[Marxism]] from an early age. He began his career as a militant in the 1950s with the activist Roman Catholic youth organization ''Gioventú Italiana di Azione Cattolica (GIAC).'' Negri became a [[communism|communist]] in 1953\u201354 when he worked at a [[kibbutz]] in Israel for a year. The kibbutz was organised according to ideas of [[zionism|Zionist]] socialism and all the members were Jewish communists.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ganahl|first=Rainer|url=http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|title=Marx is still Marx: Antonio Negri|work=Semiotext(e)|accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref> He joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]] in 1956 and remained a member until 1963, while at the same time becoming more and more engaged throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in Marxist movements.\u000a\u000aHe had a quick academic career at the [[University of Padua]] and was promoted to full professor at a young age in the field of "''dottrina dello Stato''" (State theory), a peculiarly Italian field that deals with juridical and constitutional theory. This might have been facilitated by his connections to influential politicians such as [[Raniero Panzieri]] and philosopher [[Norberto Bobbio]], strongly engaged with the Socialist Party.\u000a\u000aIn the early 1960s Negri joined the editorial group of ''Quaderni Rossi'', a journal that represented the intellectual rebirth of Marxism in Italy outside the realm of the communist party.\u000a\u000aIn 1969, together with [[Oreste Scalzone]] and [[Franco Piperno]], Negri was one of the founders of the group [[Potere Operaio]] (Workers' Power) and the ''[[Operaismo]]'' ([[workerist]]) Communist movement. ''Potere Operaio'' disbanded in 1973 and gave rise to the [[Autonomia]] Operaia Organizzata (Organised Workers' Autonomy) movement.\u000a\u000a==Arrest and flight==\u000aOn 16 March 1978, [[Aldo Moro]], former Italian prime minister and Christian Democrat party leader, was kidnapped in Rome by the [[Red Brigades]], his five-man body guard murdered on the spot of the kidnapping in Rome's Via Fani. While they were holding him, forty-five days after the kidnapping,<ref name=windschuttle/> the Red Brigades called his family on the phone, informing Moro's wife of her husband's impending death.<ref name=windschuttle/> Nine days later his body, shot in the head, was found dumped in a city lane.<ref name=windschuttle/> The conversation was recorded, and later broadcast and televised. A number of people who knew Negri and remembered his voice identified him as the probable author of the call, but the claim has been since dismissed: the author of the call was, in fact, [[Valerio Morucci]].<ref name="telefonobluff">{{cite news |title=Tecniche d'indagine.

Padova's Public Prosecutor Pietro Calogero accused those involved in the political wing of the Red Brigades, and thus behind [[left-wing terrorism]] in Italy.

Accessed 7/04/10</ref>\u000a\u000a== Political thought and writing ==\u000a{{Left communism sidebar}}\u000aUnlike other forms of [[Marxism]], autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the [[working class]] to force changes to the organization of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[trade unions]] or [[political parties]]. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, for example [[absenteeism]], slow working, and socialization in the workplace. The journal ''Quaderni Rossi'' ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor ''Classe Operaia'' ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. Both were founded by Antonio Negri and [[Mario Tronti]].\u000a\u000aToday, Antonio Negri is best known as the co-author, with [[Michael Hardt]], of the controversial Marxist-inspired treatise ''[[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|Empire]]'' (2000).<ref name="bull"/>\u000a\u000aIn 2009 Negri completed the book ''Commonwealth'', the final in a trilogy that began in 2000 with ''Empire'' and continued with ''Multitude'' in 2004, co-authored with Michael Hardt.<ref name="gray">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |title=Commonwealth, By Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri / First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, By Slavoj Zizek | author= Gray, John |publisher=[[The Independent]]|language=|date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref>\u000a\u000aSince ''Commonwealth'', he has written multiple notable articles on the [[Arab Spring]] and [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] movements along with other social issues.<ref name="Arab">Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/24/arabs-democracy-latin-america Arabs are democracy's new pioneers], The Guardian, 24 February 2011.</ref><ref name="Foreign">Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136399/michael-hardt-and-antonio-negri/the-fight-for-real-democracy-at-the-heart-of-occupy-wall-street The Fight for 'Real Democracy' at the Heart of Occupy Wall Street], Foreign Affairs, 11 October 2011.</ref>\u000a\u000a=== ''Labor of Dionysus: A Critique of the State-Form'' (1994)===\u000aIn this book the authors ask themselves "How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society?"

The enemy now must be understood as a kind of criminal, as someone who represents a threat not to a political system or a nation but to the law. This is the enemy as a terrorist....In the "new order that envelops the entire space of... civilization", where conflict between nations has been made irrelevant, the "enemy" is simultaneously "banalized" (reduced to an object of routine police repression) and absolutized (as the Enemy, an absolute threat to the ethical order"<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, ''Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts & London, England: Harvard University Press, 2000), pg 6.</ref>).<ref>Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 171-172.</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000a''Empire'' elaborates a variety of ideas surrounding constitutions, global war, and class. Hence, the Empire is constituted by a [[monarchy]] (the [[United States]] and the [[G8]], and [[international organizations]] such as [[NATO]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] or the [[World Trade Organization]]), an [[oligarchy]] (the [[multinational corporations]] and other nation-states) and a democracy (the various [[non-government organization]]s and the [[United Nations]]). Part of the book's analysis deals with "imagin<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> resistance", but "the point of Empire is that it, too, is "total" and that resistance to it can only take the form of negation - "the will to be against".<ref>Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 173.</ref> The Empire is total, but [[economic inequality]] persists, and as all identities are wiped out and replaced with a universal one, the identity of the poor persists.<ref>"The problem, as they see it, is that "postmodernist authors" have neglected the one identity that should matter most to those on the left, the one we have always with us: "The only non-localizable 'common name' of pure difference in all eras is that of the poor" (156)...only the poor, Hardt and Negri say, "live radically the actual and present being" (157)."

In order to do so, Hardt and Negri argue, one must first analyze the present configuration of war and its contradictions. This analysis is performed in the first chapter, after which chapters two and three focus on multitude and democracy, respectively. ''Multitude'' is not so much a sequel as it is a reiteration from a new point of view in a new, relatively accessible style that is distinct from the predominantly [[Academia|academic]] prose style of ''Empire''. Multitude remains, the authors insist, despite its ubiquitous subject matter and its almost casual tone, a book of philosophy which aims to shape a conceptual ground for a political process of democratization rather than present an answer to the question \u2018what to do?\u2019 or offer a programme for concrete action.\u000a\u000a=== ''Commonwealth'' (2009)===\u000a{{main|Commonwealth (book)}}\u000aIn this book, the authors introduce the concept of "the republic of property": "What is central for our purposes here is that the concept of property and the defense of property remain the foundation of every modern political constitution. This is the sense in which the republic, from the great bourgeois revolutions to today, is a republic of property".<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.15</ref> Part 2 of the book deals with the relationship between modernity and anti-modernity and proposes "alter-modernity". Alter-modernity "involves not only insertion in the long history of antimodern struggles but also rupture with any fixed dialectic between modern sovereignty and antimodern resistance. In the passage from antimodernity to altermodernity, just as tradition and identity are transformed, so too resistance takes on a new meaning, dedicated now to the constitution of alternatives. The freedom that forms the base of resistance, as we explained earlier, comes to the fore and constitutes an event to announce a new political project."<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.107</ref>\u000a\u000aFor [[Alex Callinicos]] in a review "What is newest in ''Commonwealth'' is its take on the fashionable idea of the common. Hardt and Negri mean by this not merely the natural resources that capital seeks to appropriate, but also "the languages we create, the social practices we establish, the modes of sociality that define our relationships", which are both the means and the result of biopolitical production. Communism, they argue, is defined by the common, just as capitalism is by the private and socialism (which they identify in effect with statism) with the public."<ref>[http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11189 Commonwealth. Book Review by Alex Callinicos, March 2010]</ref> For [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] Negri and Hardt "in the search of an altermodernity-something that is outside the dialectical opposition between modernity and anti-modernity-they need a means of escape. The choice between capitalism and socialism, they suggest is all wrong. We need to identify something entirely different, communism-working within a different set of dimensions."<ref name="korotonomedya1">[http://www.korotonomedya.net/kor/index.php?id=27,316,0,0,1,0 David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

It "should not shun identity politics but instead must work through it and learn from it," because it is the "primary vehicle for struggle within and against the republic of property since identity itself is based on property and sovereignty."<ref name="korotonomedya1"/> In the same exchange in [[Artforum]] between Harvey and Micheal Hardt and Antonio Negri, Hardt and Negri attempt to correct Harvey in a concept that is important within the argument of ''Commonwealth''. As such, they state that "We instead define the concept of [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time - that is, a process of becoming."<ref name="korotonomedya1"/>\u000a\u000a=== Occupy movements of 2011\u20132012 and ''Declaration'' ===\u000aIn May 2012 Negri self-published (with Michael Hardt) an electronic pamphlet on the [[Occupy movement|occupy and encampment movements of 2011\u20132012]] called ''[[Declaration (book)|Declaration]]'' that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy.
