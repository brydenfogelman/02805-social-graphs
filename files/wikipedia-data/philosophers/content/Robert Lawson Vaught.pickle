C. Berkeley]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aVaught was a musical prodigy in his youth, in his case playing the piano. He began his university studies at [[Pomona College]], at age 16. When [[World War II]] broke out, he enlisted into the [[US Navy]] which assigned him to the [[University of California]]'s [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] program. He graduated in 1945 with an AB in physics.\u000a\u000aIn 1946, he began a Ph.D. in mathematics at Berkeley. He initially worked under the supervision of the topologist [[John L. Kelley]], writing on [[C* algebra]]s. In 1950, in response to [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] pressures, Berkeley required all staff to sign a [[loyalty oath]]. Kelley declined and moved his career to [[Tulane University]] for three years. Vaught then began afresh under the supervision of [[Alfred Tarski]], completing in 1954 a thesis on [[mathematical logic]], titled ''Topics in the Theory of Arithmetical Classes and Boolean Algebras''. After spending four years at the [[University of Washington]], Vaught returned to Berkeley in 1958, where he remained until his 1991 retirement.\u000a\u000aIn 1957, Vaught married Marilyn Maca; they had two children.\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000aVaught's work is primarily focused on [[model theory]]. In 1957, he and Tarski introduced [[elementary submodel]]s and the [[Tarski\u2013Vaught test]] characterizing them. In 1962, he and [[Michael D. Morley|M. D. Morley]] pioneered the concept of a [[saturated structure]]. His investigations on countable models of first order theories led him to the [[Vaught conjecture]] stating that the [[cardinality|number]] of countable models of a complete first order theory (in a countable language) is always either finite, or countably infinite, or equinumerous with the real numbers.  Vaught's [[Vaught's theorem|"Never 2" theorem]] states that a complete first order theory cannot have exactly 2 nonisomorphic countable models.\u000a\u000aHe considered his best work was his paper "Invariant sets in topology and logic"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, introducing the [[Vaught transform]]. He is known for the Tarski\u2013Vaught test for elementary substructures, the [[Feferman\u2013Vaught theorem]], the [[\u0141o\u015b\u2013Vaught test]] for completeness and decidability, the Vaught two-cardinal theorem, and his conjecture on the nonfinite axiomatizability of totally [[categorical theory|categorical theories]] (this work eventually led to [[geometric stability theory]]).\u000a\u000aVaught was a capable teacher of undergraduates, and his writing was reputed for elegance and clarity. His ''Set Theory: An Introduction'' (2001, 2nd ed.) attests to his abilities in this regard.\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[\u0141o\u015b\u2013Vaught test]]\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a*Feferman, Anita Burdman, and [[Solomon Feferman]], 2004.
