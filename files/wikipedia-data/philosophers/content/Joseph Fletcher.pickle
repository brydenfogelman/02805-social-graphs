Our cultural tradition holds that life has absolute value, but that is really not good enough anymore. Sometimes, no life is better."{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\u000a\u000a"Ethics critically examines values and how they are to be acted out; but whether they are acted out or not, loyalty to them depends on character or personal quality, and so it follows that the quality of medicine depends on the character of its clinicians."{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\u000a\u000a"We ought to love people and use things; the essence of immorality is to love things and use people."\u000a\u000a"People [with children with [[Down's syndrome]]]... have no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down's syndrome baby away, whether it's "put away" in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible lethal sense. It is sad; yes. Dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person, and a Down's is not a person."<ref name=Bard>{{cite journal|last=Bard|first=Bernard|author2=Joseph Fletcher|title=The Right to Die|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=April 1968|pages=59-64|url=http://www.riverbendds.org/index.htm?page=fletcher.html}}</ref>\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a* "Memoir of an Ex-Radical," Joseph Francis Fletcher Papers (20: 29).\u000a* "Recollections," Joseph Francis Fletcher Papers (20: 31).\u000a* Joseph Francis Fletcher Papers, The Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, Department of Historical Collections and Services, University of Virginia.\u000a\u000a== Notable works ==\u000a* 1954 ''Morals and Medicine'' N.J.: Princeton University Press.
