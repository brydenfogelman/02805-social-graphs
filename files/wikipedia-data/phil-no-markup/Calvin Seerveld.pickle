VCalvin Seerveld (born 1930 in New York) received a BA from Calvin College in 1952, an MA in English literature and classics from the University of Michigan in 1953. He then went on to study under D. H. Th. Vollenhoven at the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam, where his doctoral dissertation dealt with Croce's aesthetics. It was supervised by Vollenhoven and Carlo Antoni. He then taught philosophy and German at Trinity Christian College, and went on to teach philosophical aesthetics at the Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto.\u000aSeerveld has been influential in the reformational movement. In fact he was the first to coin the term 'reformational' to describe the philosophical aspects of neo-Calvinism. He has taken Dooyeweerd's aesthetic modal aspect and developed Dooyeweerd's ideas . His book Rainbows for a Fallen World has influenced many Christian artists . In it he argues that "aesthetic obedience is required of everyone by the Lord-artist or not."2\u000aLambert Zuidervaart identifies four claims that constitute Seerveld's contribution to aesthetics1:\u000aThe aesthetic is part of the fabric of created reality, and aesthetic norms can be violated or ignored only at great cost.\u000aThe arts, despite their variety and their continuing development, are a unified sphere distinct from other spheres of cultural endeavour, offering opportunities for vocational service to Christians today.\u000aThe aesthetic is not limited only to the arts, just as the arts have many facets other than the aesthetic.\u000aThe core meaning of the aesthetic - and distinguishing characteristic of the arts - is 'allusiveness' or 'imaginativity'.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000aRainbows for a Fallen World Tuppence Press, 1980\u000aOn Being Human: Imaging God in a Modern World Welch Publishing, 1998\u000aTake Hold of God and Pull Paternoster, 1999\u000aIn the Fields of the Lord: A Calvin Seerveld Reader Craig Bartholomew (Editor) Piquant/ Tuppence Press, 2000.\u000aVoicing God's Psalms Eerdmans, 2005\u000aAll available from Tuppence Press\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a1 In Zuidervaart and Luttikhuizen (ed.)
