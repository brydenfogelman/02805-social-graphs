VThomas Berry, C.P., PhD (November 9, 1914 \u2013 June 1, 2009) was a Catholic priest of the Passionist order, cultural historian and ecotheologian (although cosmologist and geologian \u2013 or \u201cEarth scholar\u201d \u2013 were his preferred descriptors). Among advocates of "ecospirituality" and the "New Story," he is famous for proposing the idea that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. He is considered a leader in the tradition of Teilhard de Chardin.\u000aBerry believed that humanity, after generations spent in self-glorification and despoiling the world, is poised to embrace a new role as a vital part of a larger, interdependent \u201ccommunion of subjects\u201d on earth and in the universe.\u000aBerry said the transformation of humanity\u2019s priorities will not come easily. It requires what he called \u201cthe great work\u201d \u2014 the title of his last major book \u2014 in four institutional realms: the political and legal order; the economic and industrial world; education; and religion.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aBorn to William and Betty Berry in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1914, Berry was the third of 13 children. He was named for his father, William Nathan Berry, who founded Berico Fuels in 1924. At age 11 he had an epiphany in a meadow, which became a primary reference point for the rest of his life. He later elaborated this experience into a set of Twelve Principles for Understanding the Universe and the Role of the Human in the Universe Process. The first of these principles states:\u000a\u000aThe universe, the solar system, and planet earth in themselves and in their evolutionary emergence constitute for the human community the primary revelation of that ultimate mystery whence all things emerge into being.\u000a\u000aBerry entered a monastery of the Passionist order in 1933, where he adopted the name "Thomas," after Thomas Aquinas. He was ordained in 1942. He began studying cultural history, especially the world's religions.\u000aHe received his doctorate in history from The Catholic University of America, with a thesis on Giambattista Vico's philosophy of history. He then studied Chinese language and Chinese culture in China and learned Sanskrit for the study of India and the traditions of religion in India. He published a book on the religions of India and one on Buddhism. Later he assisted in an educational program for the T'boli tribal peoples of South Cotabato, a province of the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, and he taught the cultural history of India and China at universities in New Jersey and New York (1956\u20131965). Later he was director of the graduate program in the History of Religions at Fordham University (1966\u20131979). He founded and directed the Riverdale Center of Religious Research in Riverdale, New York (1970\u20131995). Berry studied and was influenced by the work of Teilhard de Chardin and was president of the American Teilhard Association (1975\u20131987). He also studied Native American cultures and shamanism. From his academic beginnings as a historian of world cultures and religions, Berry developed into a historian of the Earth and its evolutionary processes. He described himself as a "geologian".\u000aIn 1995, Berry returned to Greensboro, North Carolina. While nominally retired, he continued to write, lecture, and receive friends at his home. In a tribute to Berry, Mary Evelyn Tucker says that his books \u2013 The Dream of the Earth (1988 reprinted, 2006), The Universe Story (with Brian Swimme, 1992), and The Great Work: Our Way into the Future (1999) \u2013 are "major contributions to the discussion on the environment". A collection of his essays, Evening Thoughts: Reflecting on Earth as Sacred Community, was jointly published by Sierra Club Books and the University of California Press.\u000aHis work continues with the Thomas Berry Foundation, the American Teilhard Association, the Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale, and the Journey of the Universe project.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aThomas Berry's books include:\u000aThe Historical Theory of Giambattista Vico (1949)\u000aBuddhism (1968)\u000aThe Religions of India (1972)\u000aThe Dream of the Earth (1988)\u000aBefriending the Earth (with Thomas Clarke, 1991)\u000aThe Universe Story From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era, A Celebration of the Unfolding of the Cosmos (with physicist Brian Swimme, 1992)\u000aThe Great Work: Our Way into the Future (1999), Bell Tower/Random House, NY, ISBN 0-609-80499-5\u000aEvening Thoughts: Reflecting on Earth as Sacred Community (2006), Essays, edited by Mary Evelyn Tucker, A Sierra Club Book, ISBN 1-57805-130-4, See description and TOC.\u000aThe Christian Future and the Fate of Earth (2009), [1], Essays edited by Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim.\u000aBerry also contributed two introductory essays ('Economics: Its Effects on the Life Systems of the World' and 'The Earth: A New Context for Religious Unity') to the volume Thomas Berry and the New Cosmology, in which Brian Swimme, Caroline Richards, Gregory Baum and others discuss the implications of Berry's thought for a range of disciplines and paradigms. Berry's 'Twelve Principles for Understanding the Universe and the Role of the Human in the Universe Process' offer a postscript to this 1987 work.\u000aBerry was featured in the 2007 documentary What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honorary degrees ==\u000a2008 Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.
