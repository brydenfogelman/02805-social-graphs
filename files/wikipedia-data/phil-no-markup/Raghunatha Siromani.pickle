VRaghunatha Shiromani (Bengali: \u09b0\u0998\u09c1\u09a8\u09be\u09a5 \u09b6\u09bf\u09b0\u09cb\u09ae\u09a3\u09bf, IAST: Raghun\u0101tha \u015airoma\u1e47i) (c. 1477\u20131547) was an Indian philosopher and logician. He was born at Nabadwip in present-day Nadia district of West Bengal state. He was the grandson of \u015aulap\u0101\u1e47i (c. 14th century CE), a noted writer on Sm\u1e5bti from his mother's side. He was a pupil of V\u0101sudeva S\u0101rvabhauma. He brought the new school of Nyaya, Navya Ny\u0101ya, representing the final development of Indian formal logic, to its zenith of analytic power.\u000aRaghunatha's analysis of relations revealed the true nature of number, inseparable from the abstraction of natural phenomena, and his studies of metaphysics dealt with the negation or nonexistence of a complex reality. His most famous work in logic was the Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47id\u012bdhiti, a commentary on the Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i of Gange\u015ba Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya, founder of the Navya Ny\u0101ya school.\u000aA descriptive information of Raghunatha with some controversial issues (his connection with Mahaprabhu Shri Chaitanya) and bibliography are to be found at Raghunatha: A Name of Negatives. The contemporary deployment of a new category, svatva ( endowment, possessed-ness, entitlement, my-ness), introduced by Raghunatha, is discussed in Language: From I-dentity to My-dentity\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==
