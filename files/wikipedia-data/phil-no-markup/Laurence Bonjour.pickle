VFrom other capitalisation: This is a redirect from a title with another method of capitalisation. It leads to the title in accordance with the Wikipedia naming conventions for capitalisation, or it leads to a title that is associated in some way with the conventional capitalisation of this redirect title. This may help writing, searching and international language issues.\u000aIf this redirect is an incorrect capitalisation, then {{R from miscapitalisation}} should be used instead, and pages that use this link should be updated to link directly to the target. Miscapitisations can be tagged in any namespace.\u000aUse this rcat to tag only mainspace redirects; when other capitalisations are in other namespaces, use {{R from modification}} instead.
