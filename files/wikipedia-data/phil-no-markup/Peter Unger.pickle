VPeter K. Unger (/\u02c8\u028c\u014b\u0259r/; born April 25, 1942) is a contemporary American philosopher and professor at New York University. His main interests lie in the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and the philosophy of mind. He attended Swarthmore College at the same time as David Lewis, earning a B.A. in philosophy in 1962, and Oxford University, where he studied under A. J. Ayer and earned a doctorate in 1966.\u000aUnger has written a defense of profound philosophical skepticism. In Ignorance (1975), he argues that nobody knows anything and even that nobody is reasonable or justified in believing anything.\u000aIn Philosophical Relativity (1984), he argues that many philosophical questions cannot be definitively answered.\u000aIn the field of applied ethics, his best-known work is Living High and Letting Die (1996). In this text, Unger argues that the citizens of first-world countries have a moral duty to make large donations to life-saving charities (such as Oxfam and UNICEF), and that once they have given all of their own money and possessions, beyond what is needed to survive, they should give what belongs to others, even if having to beg, borrow, or steal in the process.\u000aIn "The Mental Problems of the Many" (2002), he argues for Substantial Interactionist Dualism on questions of mind and matter: that each of us is an immaterial soul. The argument is extended and fortified in his 2006 book All the Power in the World.\u000aIn Empty Ideas (2014), he argues that analytic philosophy has delivered no substantial results as to how things are with concrete reality.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aIgnorance: A Case for Scepticism (Oxford University Press, 1975 and 2002) ISBN 0-19-824417-7\u000aPhilosophical Relativity (Blackwell and Minnesota, 1984; Oxford, 2002) ISBN 0-19-515553-X\u000aIdentity, Consciousness and Value (Oxford, 1990) ISBN 0-19-507917-5\u000aLiving High and Letting Die: Our Illusion of Innocence (Oxford, 1996) ISBN 0-19-510859-0\u000aAll the Power in the World (Oxford, 2006) ISBN 0-19-515561-0\u000aPhilosophical Papers, Volume 1 (Oxford, 2006) ISBN 0-19-515552-1\u000aPhilosophical Papers, Volume 2 (Oxford, 2006) ISBN 0-19-530158-7\u000aEmpty Ideas: A Critique of Analytic Philosophy (Oxford, 2014) ISBN 978-0-19933081-2\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Articles ===\u000a\u201cAn Analysis of Factual Knowledge,\u201d The Journal of Philosophy, LXV (1968): 157-170\u000a\u201cA Defense of Skepticism,\u201d The Philosophical Review, LXXX (1971): 198-219.\u000a\u201cThe Uniqueness in Causation,\u201d American Philosophical Quarterly, 14 (1977): 177-188.\u000a\u201cThere Are No Ordinary Things,\u201d Synthese, 41 (1979): 117-154.\u000a"I do not Exist", in Perception and Identity, G.
