VDign\u0101ga (c. 480 \u2013 c. 540 CE) was an Indian Buddhist scholar and one of the Buddhist founders of Indian logic (hetu vidy\u0101). Dign\u0101ga's work laid the groundwork for the development of deductive logic in India and created the first system of Buddhist logic and epistemology (Pramana). According to Georges B Dreyfus, his philosophical school brought about an Indian "epistemological turn" and became the "standard formulation of Buddhist logic and epistemology in India and Tibet." Dign\u0101ga's thought influenced later Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakirti and also Hindu thinkers of the Nyaya school. Dign\u0101ga's epistemology accepted only "perception" (pratyaksa) and "inference" (anum\u0101\u1e47a) are valid instruments of knowledge.\u000aDign\u0101ga was born into a South Indian Brahmin family in Simhavakta near Kanchipuram and very little is known of his early years, except that he took as his spiritual preceptor Nagadatta of the Pudgalavada school before being expelled and becoming a student of Vasubandhu.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosophy ==\u000a\u000aDign\u0101ga's epistemology holds that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (pram\u0101\u1e47a); "perception" (pratyaksa) and "inference" (anum\u0101\u1e47a). Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual. This conservative epistemic theory was in contrast to the Nyaya school who accepted other means of knowledge such as Upam\u0101\u1e47a (comparison and analogy).\u000aDuring Dign\u0101ga's time, the Nyaya school of Hinduism had begun to hold debates using their five-step approach to making and evaluating arguments with logic. Buddhist debaters such as Dign\u0101ga wanted to engage in these debates, and also have a way to logically evaluate arguments, but a premise such as "all dogs are mammals" proved problematic for his idealist Yogacara philosophy. Dign\u0101ga was a student of Vasubandhu, and therefore believed that "dharmas are empty." In other words, there are not universal qualities such as "dog-ness" or "mammal-ness." Such universals would have to be unchanging, and since all things are subject to change and are lacking in essential essence according to his school of philosophy, Dign\u0101ga attempted to find a way to engage in argument within the Nyaya school without positing metaphysical Universals.\u000aTo do this he employed what is referred to in formal logic in the West as contraposition, or in Sanskrit, Apoha, where one switches the terms and swaps them for their term complement. Therefore, the example premise above, "all dogs are mammals" becomes "all non-mammals are non-dogs." These two statements are logically equivalent. Once this had been done, Dign\u0101ga could make arguments about non-mammals without explicitly positing that mammals have an essential nature. While this move gets off the ground towards his goal, reflection shows that making universal statements about non-mammals still implies that there are mammals who share an essential nature, and everything else, which lacks this "mammal-ness." Still, using this method Dign\u0101ga and other Buddhist logicians were able to further their logical discourse and felt more comfortable engaging in Nyaya structured debates.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aAmong Dign\u0101ga's works there is Hetucakra (The wheel of reason), considered his first work on formal logic, advancing a new form of deductive reasoning. It may be regarded as a bridge between the older doctrine of trair\u016bpya and Dign\u0101ga's own later theory of vyapti which is a concept related to the Western notion of implication.\u000aDign\u0101ga's most important work, the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya (Compendium of Valid Cognition), examined perception, language and inferential reasoning. It presents perception as a bare cognition, devoid of conceptualization and sees language as useful fictions created through a process of exclusion (Apoha).\u000aOther works include:\u000aAlambana-par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101, (The Treatise on the Objects of Cognition)\u000aAbhidharmako\u015ba-marma-prad\u012bpa - a condensed summary of Vasubandhu's seminal work\u000aA summary of the A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrika-prajñ\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 s\u016btra\u000aTrik\u0101la-parik\u1e63a\u000aNy\u0101ya-mukha\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosophical school ==\u000aDign\u0101ga founded a tradition of Buddhist logic, and this school is sometimes called the "School of Dign\u0101ga" or the "Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti school". In Tibetan it is often called \u201cthose who follow reasoning\u201d (Tibetan: rigs pa rjes su \u2018brang ba); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit 'pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da', often translated as "the Epistemological School" or "The logico-epistemological school."\u000aBuddhist philosophers who wrote on pramana include:\u000aDharmak\u012brti (c. 7th century)\u000aJinendrabuddhi\u000aDharmapala of Nalanda\u000aSantabhadra\u000a\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (725\u2013788)\u000aDharmottara (8th century)\u000aPrajñakaragupta\u000aSamkarananda\u000aRatn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti (c.1000)\u000aJñanasrimitra (975-1025)\u000aRatnak\u012brti (11th century)\u000aThis tradition of logic and epistemology continued in Tibet, where it was expanded by thinkers such as Cha-ba (1182-1251) and Sakya Pandita (1182\u20131251).\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBuddhist logic\u000aCritical Buddhism\u000aDharmakirti\u000aEpistemology\u000aNyaya\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aChu, Junjie (2006).On Dign\u0101ga's theory of the object of cognition as presented in PS (V) 1, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 29 (2), 211\u2013254\u000aFrauwallner, Erich, Dign\u0101ga, sein Werk und seine Entwicklung.
