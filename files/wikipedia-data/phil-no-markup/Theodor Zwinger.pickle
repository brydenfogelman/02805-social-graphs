VTheodor Zwinger the Elder (2 August 1533 \u2013 10 March 1588) was a Swiss physician and humanist scholar. He made significant contributions to the emerging genres of reference and travel literature. He was the first distinguished representative of a prominent early modern Basel academic family.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and work ==\u000aZwinger was the son of the furrier Leonhard Zwinger who had become Basel citizen in 1526. His mother was Christina Herbster, the sister of Johannes Oporinus (Herbster) the famed humanist printer. After Zwinger\u2019s father\u2019s death, Christina married the noted humanist Conrad Lycosthenes (Wolffhart).\u000aZwinger studied at universities in Basel, Lyon, and Paris before taking a doctorate in medicine at the University of Padua with Bassiano Landi, the successor of Johannes Baptista Montanus. In Paris he studied with the iconoclastic philosopher Petrus Ramus. He joined the faculty of the University of Basel as a member of the consilium facultatis medicae from 1559. At Basel he held successively chairs in Greek (1565), Ethics (1571), and finally theoretical medicine (1580). While originally hostile to Paracelsus, in his later career he took an interest in Paracelsian medical theory for which he experienced some hostility. He associated with Paracelsians such as Thomas Moffet and Petrus Severinus.\u000aZwinger was the editor of the early encyclopedia Theatrum Humanae Vitae (editions 1565, 1571, 1586, 1604). The work is considered "perhaps the most comprehensive collection of knowledge to be compiled by a single individual in the early modern period." He was able to draw on the knowledge base of his stepfather Conrad Lycosthenes in compiling the Theatrum Humanae Vitae.\u000aZwinger\u2019s son, Jakob Zwinger, briefly served as his successor as editor of the Theatrum. His descendant Theodor Zwinger the Younger (1597\u20131654) was a prominent preacher and theology professor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Zwinger's works ==\u000aTheatrum Vitae Humanae \u2014 an early encyclopedia\u000aMethodus Apodemica \u2014 an early example of travel literature\u000aSpecimen Materiae medicae : cum subjunctis ubique Remediorum Formulis in Gratiam & Usum Philiatrorum ac Juniorum Practicorum tumultuaria methodo inter plurimas Mentis Distractiones fideli tamen Opera adornatum. - Basileae : Thurnisius, 1722.
