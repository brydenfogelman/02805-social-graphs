VPhilip Noel Pettit (born 1945) is an Irish philosopher and political theorist. He is Laurence Rockefeller University Professor of Politics and Human Values at Princeton University and also Professor of Philosophy at the Australian National University. He was a Guggenheim Fellow.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aHe was educated at Garbally College, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth and Queen's University, Belfast. He was a lecturer at University College, Dublin, a Research Fellow at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and professor at the University of Bradford. He was for many years Professorial Fellow in Social and Political Theory at the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University. He is the recipient of numerous honours, including an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland. He was keynote speaker at Graduate Conference, University of Toronto.\u000aPettit defends a version of republicanism in political philosophy. His book Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government provided the underlying justification for political reforms in Spain under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. Pettit detailed his relationship with Zapatero in his A Political Philosophy in Public Life: Civic Republicanism in Zapatero's Spain, co-authored with José Luis Martí.\u000aPettit holds that the lessons learned when thinking about problems in one area of philosophy often constitute ready-made solutions to problems faced in completely different areas. Views he defends in philosophy of mind give rise to the solutions he offers to problems in metaphysics about the nature of free will, and to problems in the philosophy of the social sciences, and these in turn give rise to the solutions he provides to problems in moral philosophy and political philosophy. His corpus as a whole was the subject of a series of critical essays published in Common Minds: Themes from the Philosophy of Philip Pettit (Oxford University Press, 2007).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Affiliations and honors ==\u000aFellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2009)\u000aHonorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (2010)\u000aCorresponding Fellow of the British Academy (2013)\u000aFellow of the Australian academies in Humanities and Social Science\u000aMember of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected bibliography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aThe Concept of Structuralism: a Critical Analysis (1975)\u000aJudging justice: an introduction to contemporary political philosophy (1980)\u000aRawls: 'A Theory of Justice' and its critics (1990) with Chandran Kukathas\u000aThe Common Mind; an essay on psychology, society and politics (1993)\u000aNot Just Deserts.
