He taught for many years at Wellesley College before moving to Duke.\u000aFlanagan has written extensively on consciousness. He has been realistic about the difficulty of consciousness as a scientific and philosophical problem, but optimistic about the chance of solving the problem. One of the problems in a study of consciousness is the hidden way in which conscious states are dependent on brain states. Flanagan has proposed that there is a "natural method" to go about understanding consciousness that involves creating a science of mind. Three key elements of this developing science are: paying attention to subjective reports on conscious experiences, incorporating the results from psychology and cognitive science, and including the results from neuroscience that will reveal how neuronal systems produce consciousness.\u000aFlanagan is also responsible for bringing attention to the relevance of empirical psychology on the way we think of moral psychology. His efforts spawned the modern field of moral psychology.\u000aFlanagan was also one of the first moral philosophers to see the relevance of developments in social psychology to ethics.\u000aFlanagan is currently on the Editorial Board of Greater Good Magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley. Flanagan's contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. He is also an active member of the Center for Pragmatic Buddhism's (CPB) Advisory Council.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aThe Science of the Mind (MIT Press, 1984; 2nd edition, 1991)\u000aIdentity, Character, and Morality: Essays in Moral Psychology (MIT Press, 1990)\u000aVarieties of Moral Personality: Ethics and Psychological Realism (Harvard University Press, 1991)\u000aConsciousness Reconsidered (MIT Press, 1992)\u000aSelf Expressions: Mind, Morals, and the Meaning of Life (Oxford University Press, 1996)\u000aThe Nature of Consciousness (MIT Press, 1998)\u000aDreaming Souls: Sleep, Dreams, and the Evolution of the Conscious Mind (Oxford University, 1999)\u000aNarrative and Consciousness: Literature, Psychology, and the Brain (Oxford University Press, 2002)\u000aThe Problem of the Soul: Two Visions of Mind and How to Reconcile Them (Basic 2002)\u000aThe Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World (MIT Press 2007)\u000aThe Bodhisattva's Brain: Buddhism Naturalized (MIT Press 2011)\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aJesusism\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aOwen Flanagan's Personal Webpage\u000aFlanagan's editorial work in Greater Good magazine\u000aOwen Flanagan's Personal Page
