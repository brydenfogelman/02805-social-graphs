VAlan Richard Bundy, CBE, FRS, FREng, FRSE, FBCS, FAAAI, FECCAI, FAISB, is a professor at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, known for his contributions to automated reasoning, especially to proof-planning, the use of meta-level reasoning to guide proof search.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000aAlan Bundy was educated as a Mathematician, obtaining an honours degree in Mathematics in 1968 from the University of Leicester and a PhD in Mathematical Logic in 1971, also from Leicester.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aSince 1971, Bundy has been at the University of Edinburgh: initially in the 'Metamathematics' Unit, which in 1972 became the Department of Computational Logic, in 1974 was absorbed into the new Department of Artificial Intelligence and in 1998 was absorbed into the new School of Informatics. From 1971\u201373, he was a research fellow on Prof. B. Meltzer's SERC grant Theorem Proving by Computer; in 1973 he became a university lecturer; in 1984 he was promoted to reader; in 1987 he was promoted to professorial fellow; and in 1990 he was promoted to professor. From 1987\u201392 he held an Science and Engineering Research Council Senior Fellowship. From 1998\u20132001 he was Head of the newly formed of Division (subsequently School) of Informatics at Edinburgh.\u000aFrom 2000\u20132005 he was a founder and convener of the UK Computing Research Committee, which plays an advocacy role for computing research in the UK. From 2010 he is a Vice-President and Trustee of the British Computer Society with special responsibility for the Academy of Computing.\u000aBundy is the leader of the Mathematical Reasoning Group at Edinburgh.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours and awards ==\u000aBundy was elected a founding Fellow of AAAI in 1990, a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1996, a founding fellow of AISB in 1997, a founding fellow of ECCAI in 1999, a fellow of the British Computer Society in 2004, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 2005. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2008. He was elected to ACM Fellow (2014) "For contributions to artificial intelligence, automated reasoning, and the formation and evolution of representations.".\u000aHe is the winner of the 2007 IJCAI Award for Research Excellence and Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Deduction.\u000aHe was one of the 41 professors selected worldwide to receive one of the HP Labs Innovation Research Awards 2008.\u000aBundy was appointed CBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to computing science. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012, his certificate of election reads\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==
