VTadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski (Polish: ['kotarbi\u0144ski]; 31 March 1886 \u2013 3 October 1981), was a Polish philosopher, logician and ethicist.\u000aA pupil of Kazimierz Twardowski, he was one of the most representative figures of the Lwów\u2013Warsaw School, and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU) as well as the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). He developed philosophical theory called reism (Polish: reizm) and an ethical system called independent ethics. Kotarbi\u0144ski also contributed significantly to the development of praxeology.\u000aHenryk Greniewski and Kazimierz Pasenkiewicz have been doctoral students of Kotarbi\u0144ski.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aTadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski was born on 31st March of 1886 in Warsaw, then Congress Poland, Russian Empire, into an artist's family. His father, Mi\u0142osz Kotarbi\u0144ski, was a painter and a composer; his mother, Ewa de domo Koskowska, a pianist. His uncles were - Józef Kotarbi\u0144ski, an important figure in Polish theater circles and Wilhelm Kotarbi\u0144ski - a talented painter. Expelled from secondary school in 1905 for participating in a strike, Kotarbi\u0144ski managed to graduate two years later. He studied first as an unenrolled student at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, attending mostly lectures on mathematics and physics; then architecture in Lvov and Darmstadt, to finally settle for studies in philosophy and classical philology at the Lvov University. His professors were some of the most esteemed philosophers, logicians and mathematicians of his time: Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Witwicki and philologist Stanis\u0142aw Witkowski. He received his PhD degree with the thesis "Utilitarianism in the ethics of Mill and Spencer" in 1912.\u000aAfter graduation he first worked as a secondary school classical languages teacher at the Rey Gymnasium in Warsaw. In 1918 Kotarbi\u0144ski started lecturing career in philosophy at the Warsaw University. In years 1929/1930 he held the position of Dean of Humanities Faculty.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosophy ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reism ===\u000aReism is a pansomatism (from Greek:\u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd meaning "all" and \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 - "body") ontology as well as semantic theory developed by Kotarbi\u0144ski and most extensively exposed in his major work: Elements of the Theory of Knowledge, Formal Logic and Methodology of the Sciences, first published in 1929. Kotarbi\u0144ski was the creator of the term reism - a word derived from the Latin "res" meaning "thing".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ontological reism ===\u000aKotarbi\u0144ski's ontological reism approach assumes that the only things that exist, and thus the only ontological category to be used, are individual, concrete objects (or bodies) in opposition to doctrines allowing for the existence of such categories as universals, states of affairs, properties, relations, sets, classes, mental constructs etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Semantic reism ===\u000aIn its sematic formulation Kotarbi\u0144ski postulated that meaningful sentences have to contain so-called genuine names (referring to concrete objects) as opposed to abstract objects' names or non-genuine names (onomatoids). He also distinguished onomatoids from empty names, which he considered to be reistic. Sentences with onomatoids only were in his view meaningless, whereas those with empty names meaningful.\u000aReism has been anticipated by philosophers preceding Kotarbi\u0144ski (Leibnitz, Brentano and his pupils and earlier nominalists and materialists), but it was Kotarbi\u0144ski who developed it to the complete, systematic exposition and gave it its name.\u000aIn 1958 in "Philosophical Studies" n4 (7) Kotarbi\u0144ski published Developmental Stages of Concretism, an essay in which he discussed the construction and evolution of his theory starting from the early concretism or nominalism, passing through seven stages of re-elaboration and finally culminating in pansomatism. Kotarbi\u0144ski used terms: reism, pansomatism and concretism as equivalents to some extent throughout his works.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aElementy teorii poznania, logiki formalnej i metodologii nauk.
