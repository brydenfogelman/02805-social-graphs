VHolly Martin Smith (also known as Holly S. Goldman) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. Her publications focus on questions in normative ethics, moral responsibility and structural questions common to normative theories.\u000aA recipient of the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Fellowship at the National Humanities Center (2013\u201314), she held an American Association of University Women Postgraduate Fellowship (1975\u201376) and a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for Independent Study (1982-83.)\u000aBetween 1985 and 2006 she held a series of increasingly responsible academic administrative positions, first at the University of Arizona, including Head, Department of Philosophy (1985\u201390), Vice Provost for Academic Affairs (1991-June 1993), and Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences (1993-July 2001); and then at Rutgers University-New Brunswick from 2001 to 2006: Executive Dean Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Dean of the Graduate School-New Brunswick. Active in national academic administrative organizations, she served as President of the Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences, a national organization of arts and sciences deans, during 2000-01.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and career ==\u000aSmith received her early education in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Attending Wellesley College on a National Merit Scholarship, she received her B.A. as First Trustee Fellow in 1966, followed by an M.A. (1970) and a Ph.D. (1972) in Philosophy from the University of Michigan. Smith taught at Tufts University (1970\u201371), The University of Michigan at Flint (1971\u201372), The University of Pittsburgh (1972\u201373), The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (1973-80), The University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (1980\u201383), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Visiting Associate Professor, 1981\u201382), and The University of Arizona (1983-2001). From 2001 she has served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.\u000aHer husband Alvin I. Goldman is Board of Governors Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers. Her sister Sherri Smith, a prominent fiber artist, is Catherine B. Heller Collegiate Professor at the University of Michigan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Research ==\u000aSmith\u2019s philosophical work falls into four main areas: biomedical ethics (with an emphasis on reproductive ethics); consequentialism (the theory that the moral status of our acts depends on their consequences alone); moral responsibility; and normative ethics concerns that transcend particular normative theories.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reproductive ethics ===\u000aSmith defended a liberal perspective, arguing that the fetus has no natural right to the use of its mother\u2019s body during pregnancy, and that it has no right to \u201crescue\u201d by the mother.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Consequentialism ===\u000aSmith focused on forms of rule utilitarianism, arguing, contra David Lyons, that act utilitarianism and full compliance forms of rule utilitarianism do not always prescribe the same actions, and maintaining that the project of finding an appropriate definition for \u201cconsequences\u201d within rule utilitarianism had been misconceived and was doomed to failure.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Moral responsibility ===\u000aSmith explored how to assess an agent\u2019s degree of credit or blameworthiness for an action when the agent acts from a mixture of good and bad motives. She worked on the question of whether an agent is blameworthy for a wrongful act done in culpable ignorance. Her most noted paper is \u201cCulpable Ignorance,\u201d which was named by The Philosopher\u2019s Annual as one of the ten best articles in 1983. It analysed in detail the terms of the debate between those who argue that a person is blameworthy for an action performed in culpable ignorance, versus those who hold that while a person is blameworthy for the initial dereliction of failing to acquire information, that does not taint a subsequent action, done in culpable ignorance, that is itself done from acceptable motives.\u000aSmith concluded that the only defense for the position\u2014a controversial one in law and philosophy\u2014is one that holds people blameworthy for the unlucky consequences of their actions.\u000aLater she explored the implications of cognitive and social psychology for questions about moral responsibility, arguing that agents should not be held responsible for emotional reactions and behavior that issue from cognitive processes involving automatic (Kahneman/Tversky's System 1) responses to environmental stimuli.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Actualism ====\u000aMuch of Smith\u2019s work focused on questions about right and wrong that are common to many distinct ethical theories, including both consequentialist theories and deontological ones (the moral status of an act depends on features of an act other than its consequences, such as whether or not it involves telling a lie or breaking a promise). Her paper \u201cDated Rightness and Moral Imperfection\u201d helped launch a debate now known as the debate between Actualism and Possibilism by arguing for the first time in favor of Actualism. Possibilists believe that whether or not the agent ought to perform an immediate action depends on whether performing it would enable the ideal course of action in the future. Actualists believe that whether or not an agent ought to perform the action depends on what performing that action would actually lead her to do in the future.\u000aThe issue is illustrated by an example from Smith/Goldman\u2019s later paper \u201cDoing the Best One Can\u201d. A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a job interview. If S agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year job. If S accepts the task but fails to comment on the paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no job offer. If S declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year job offer. Clearly S\u2019s accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student\u2019s receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. Actualism takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Information ===\u000aSmith also considered the question of how to use moral theories in actual decision-making, especially given agent's lack of enough information about the world to ascertain accurately which action their favored moral theory implies. Thus the intent to avoid adultery may be thwarted by not knowing that a partner is actually married. And someone trying to follow W. D. Ross\u2019s prima facie duty to keep promises may fail should she forget the promise. Smith repeatedly explored these \u201cepistemic\u201d problems and argued that the solution depends on recognizing that moral theories must be supplemented by a hierarchy of decision rules that prescribe acts as \u201csubjectively right\u201d to agents who are uncertain what the moral theory itself recommends. Smith was awarded a National Humanities Center Fellowship during 2013-14 to complete a book manuscript on this cluster of epistemic challenges to using morality to make decisions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Recognition ==\u000aSmith\u2019s article "Culpable Ignorance" was selected by The Philosopher's Annual as one of the ten best articles to appear in print in 1983. Fellowships supporting her research included:\u000aDanforth Graduate Fellowship (1966\u201371),\u000aAmerican Association of University Women Postgraduate Fellowship (1975\u201376);\u000aNational Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for Independent Study (1982\u201383),\u000aCouncil for Philosophical Studies Institute on Moral Problems in Medicine Fellowship;\u000aVisiting Fellowship from the School of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, The Australian National University (Summer 2011);\u000aCarl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Fellowship, National Humanities Center (2013\u201314).\u000aWhile dean she was elected to the Presidency of the Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences (2000\u201301). She served as chair of the American Philosophical Association Pacific Division Program Committee, 1989\u201390, and is a member of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Editorial Board as subject co-editor for Normative Ethics (from August 2013).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000a"Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection," The Philosophical Review, Vol. LXXXV (October 1976), 449-487 (published under the name Holly S.
