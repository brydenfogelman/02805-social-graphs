VJay Frank Rosenberg (April 18, 1942 in Chicago IL \u2013 February 21, 2008 in Chapel Hill NC) was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was a student of Wilfrid Sellars and established his reputation with ten books and over 80 articles in metaphysics, epistemology, the philosophy of language, and the history of philosophy (especially Kant). His most commercially successful work, The Practice of Philosophy: A Handbook for Beginners, is a standard text in introductory philosophy courses, and has been translated into German.\u000aRosenberg's first publication, The Impoverished Students' Book of Cookery, Drinkery, and Housekeepery!, written while an undergraduate at Reed College, has since been republished and is available from the Reed College bookstore. Also while at Reed, Rosenberg was a keen observer and commenter of the tabletop game Empire, though he never played.\u000aRosenberg won almost $50,000 on the television game show Jeopardy! in 1986 and returned for the program's Ultimate Tournament of Champions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Books ==\u000aReadings in the Philosophy of Language, co-edited with Charles Travis; Prentice-Hall, Inc.; Englewood Cliffs, NJ; 1971.\u000aLinguistic Representation, D.
