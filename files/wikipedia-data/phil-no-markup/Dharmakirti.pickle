VDharmak\u012brti (fl. c. 6th or 7th century) was an influential Indian Buddhist philosopher who worked at N\u0101land\u0101. He was one of the key scholars of epistemology (pramana) in Buddhist philosophy, and is associated with the Yogacara  and Sautrantika schools. He was also one of the primary theorists of Buddhist atomism. His works influenced the scholars of Mimamsa, Nyaya and Shaivism schools of Hindu philosophy as well as scholars of Jainism.\u000aDharmak\u012brti's Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, his largest and most important work, was very influential in India and Tibet as a central text on pramana ('valid knowledge instruments') and was widely commented on by various Indian and Tibetan scholars. His texts remain part of modern era studies in Buddhist monasteries in Tibet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aLittle is known for certain about the life of Dharmakirti. Tibetan hagiographies suggest he was a Brahmin born in South India, studied under Isvarasena, belonged to the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, left Mimamsa and moved to Nalanda where he interacted with 6th century Dharmapala. However, the accuracy of the Tibetan hagiographies is uncertain, and scholars place him in the 7th-century instead. This is because of inconsistencies in different Tibetan and Chinese texts, and because it is around the middle of 7th-century, and thereafter, that Indian texts begin discussing his ideas, such as the citation of Dharmakirti verses in the works of Adi Shankara. Dharmak\u012brti is placed by most scholars to have lived between 600\u2013660 CE, but a few place him earlier.\u000aDharmakirti is credited with building upon the work of Dign\u0101ga, the pioneer of Buddhist logic, and Dharmakirti has ever since been influential in the Buddhist tradition. His theories became normative in Tibet and are studied to this day as a part of the basic monastic curriculum.\u000aDharmakirti worked at Nalanda as a lay Buddhist, not as an ordained monk, and his work reflects his belief that no one will understand the value of his work, his efforts soon forgotten. History proved his fears wrong.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosophy ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Historical context ===\u000aThe Buddhist works such as the Yogacarabhumi-sastra and the Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra composed before the 6th century CE, on hetuvidy\u0101 (logic, dialectics) are unsystematic, whose approach and structure are heresiological, proselytical and apologetic. Their aims were to defeat non-Buddhist opponents (Hinduism, Jainism, Ajivikas, others), defend the ideas of Buddhism, develop a line of arguments that monks can use to convert those who doubt Buddhism and to strengthen the faith of Buddhists who begin to develop doubts. Around the middle of the 6th century, possibly to address the polemics of non-Buddhist traditions with their pramana foundations, the Buddhist scholar Dign\u0101ga shifted the emphasis from dialectics to more systematic epistemology and logic, retaining the heresiological and apologetic focus. Dharmak\u012brti followed in Dign\u0101ga footsteps, and is credited with systematic philosophical doctrines on Buddhist epistemology, which Vincent Eltschinger states, has "a full-fledged positive/direct apologetic commitment". Dharmak\u012brti lived during the collapse of the Gupta Empire, a time of great insecurity for Buddhist institutions. The role of Buddhist logic was seen as an intellectual defense against Hindu philosophical arguments formulated by epistemically sophisticated traditions like the Nyaya school. However, Dharmak\u012brti and his followers also held that the study of reasoning and its application was an important tool for soteriological ends.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Epistemology ===\u000a\u000aDharmak\u012brti's philosophy is based on the need to establish a theory of logical validity and certainty grounded in causality. Following Dign\u0101ga's Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya, Dharmak\u012brti also holds that there are only two instruments of knowledge or 'valid cognition' (pram\u0101\u1e47a); "perception" (pratyaksa) and "inference" (anum\u0101\u1e47a). Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual. In the Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika Dharmak\u012brti defines a pramana as a "reliable cognition". What it means for a cognition to be reliable has been interpreted in different ways. Following commentators like Dharmottara, who define it as meaning that a cognition is able to lead to the obtaining of one's desired object, some modern scholars such as Jose I. Cabezon have interpreted Dharmak\u012brti as defending a form of Pragmatism. Tillemans sees him as holding to a weak form of correspondence theory, which holds that to "confirm causal efficacy" (arthakriy\u0101sthiti) is to have a justification that an object of cognition has the causal powers we expected. That justification comes through a certain kind of non-conceptual perception (pratyak\u1e63a) which is said to be an "intrinsical source of knowledge" (svata\u1e25 pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) which is ultimately reliable. Dharmak\u012brti sees a cognition as being valid if it has a causal connection with the object of cognition through an intrinsically valid, un-conceptual perception of the object which does not err regarding its functionality. As Dharmakirti says: "A pram\u0101\u1e47a is a reliable cognition. [As for] reliability, it consists in [this cognition\u2019s] compliance with [the object\u2019s capacity to] perform a function" (Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika 2.1ac).\u000aDharmak\u012brti also holds that there were certain extraordinary epistemic warrants, such as the words of the Buddha, who was said to be a authoritative/reliable person (pram\u0101\u1e47apuru\u1e63a) as well as the 'inconceivable' perception of a yogi (yogipratyak\u1e63a). On the role of scriptural authority, Dharmak\u012brti has a moderate and nuanced position. For Dharmak\u012brti, scripture (Buddhist or otherwise) is not a genuine and independent mean of valid cognition. He held that one should not use scripture to guide one on matters which can be decided by factual and rational means and that one is not to be faulted for rejecting unreasonable parts of the scriptures of one's school. However scripture is to be relied upon when dealing with "radically inaccessible things", such as the laws of karma and soteriology. However according to Dharmak\u012brti scripture is a fallible source of knowledge and has no claim to certainty.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Metaphysics ===\u000aAccording to Buddhologist Tom Tillemans, Dharmak\u012brti's ideas constitute a nominalist philosophy which disagrees with the Madhyamaka philosophy, by asserting that some entities are real. Dharmak\u012brti states that the real is only the momentarily existing particulars (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), and any universal (s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) is unreal and a fiction. He criticized the Nyaya theory of universals by arguing that since they have no causal efficacy, there is no rational reason to posit them. What is real must have powers (\u015bakti), fitness (yogyat\u0101) or causal properties which is what individuates a real particular as an object of perception. Dharmak\u012brti writes "whatever has causal powers (arthakriy\u0101samartha), that really exists (param\u0101rthasat)." This theory of causal properties has been interpreted as a form of trope theory. Svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a are said to be part-less, undivided and property-less, and yet they impart a causal force which give rise to perceptual cognitions, which are direct reflections of the particulars.\u000aDharmak\u012brti's ultimately real (param\u0101rthasat) particulars are contrasted with conventionally real entities (sa\u1e43v\u1e5btisat) as part of his presentation of the Buddhist Two truths doctrine. The conventionally real for him are based on linguistic categories, intellectual constructs and erroneous superimpositions on the flow of reality, such as the idea that universals exist. According to Dharmak\u012brti, cognitive distortion of the direct perception of particulars occurs during the process of recognition (pratyabhijñ\u0101na) and perceptual judgment (ni\u015bcaya) which arises due to latent tendencies (v\u0101san\u0101) in the mind left over from past impressions of similar perceptions. These latent dispositions come together into constructed representations of the previously experienced object at the moment of perception, and hence it is an imposed error on the real, a pseudo-perception (pratyak\u1e63\u0101bh\u0101sa) which conceals (sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti) reality while at the same time being practically useful for navigating it. Ignorance (avidy\u0101) for Dharmak\u012brti is conceptuality, pseudo-perception and superimposition overlaid on the naturally radiant (prabh\u0101svara) nature of pure perception. By correcting these defilements of perception through mental cultivation as well as using inference to gain "insight born of (rational) reflection" (cint\u0101may\u012b prajñ\u0101) a Buddhist yogi is able to better see the true nature of reality until his perception is fully perfected.\u000aDharmak\u012brti, again following Dign\u0101ga, also holds that that things as they are in themselves are \u201cineffable\u201d (avyapade\u015bya). Language is never about the things in themselves, only about conceptual fictions, hence they are nominalists. Due to this theory, the main issue for Dharmakirti becomes how to explain that it is possible for our arbitrary and conventional linguistic schemas to refer to perceptual particulars which are ineffable and non conceptual. To explain this gap between conceptual schema and perceptual content, Dharmakirti takes up Dignaga's theory of "exclusion" (apoha). Dign\u0101ga's view is that "a word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation of other things." Dharmak\u012brti's unique take on this nominalist theory, which underlies his entire system, is to reinterpret it in terms of causal efficacy - arthakriy\u0101 (which can also be translated as 'telic function', 'functionality', and 'fulfillment of purpose').\u000aDharmak\u012brti developed his philosophical system to defend Buddhist doctrines, so it is no surprise that he developed a number of arguments for rebirth, the four noble truths, the authority of the Buddha, karma, anatta and compassion as well as attacking Brahminical views such as the authority of the Vedas, the existence of God and the Indian caste system.\u000aDharmak\u012brti also defended the Buddhist theory of momentariness (k\u1e63a\u1e47ikatva), which held that dhammas spontaneously perish the moment they arise. Dharmak\u012brti came up with an argument for the theory which stated that since anything that really exists has a causal power, the fact that its causal power is in effect proves it is always changing. For Dharmak\u012brti, nothing could be a cause while remaining the same, and any permanent thing would be causally inert.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Philosophy of Mind ===\u000aDharmak\u012brti defends Dign\u0101ga's theory of consciousness being non-conceptually reflexive (svasamvitti or svasa\u1e43vedana). This is the idea that an act of intentional consciousness is also aware of itself as aware. Consciousness is said to illuminate itself like a lamp that illuminates objects in a room as well as itself. Dharmak\u012brti also defends the Yogacara theory of "awareness-only" (vijñaptim\u0101trat\u0101), which held that 'external objects' of perception do not exist. According to Dharmak\u012brti, an object of cognition is not external or separate from the act of cognition itself. This is because the object is "necessarily experienced simultaneously with the cognition [itself]" (Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika 3.387). The view that there is a duality (dvaya) between an object (gr\u0101hya) and a subjective cognition (gr\u0101haka) arises out of ignorance.\u000aDharmak\u012brti's Substantiation of Other Mindstreams (Sa\u1e43t\u0101n\u0101ntarasiddhi) is a treatise on the nature of the mindstream and Buddhist response to the Problem of other minds Dharmakirti held the mindstream to be beginning-less yet also described the mindstream as a temporal sequence, and that as there are no true beginnings, there are no true endings, hence, the "beginningless time" motif that is frequently used to describe the concept of mindstream.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Affiliation ===\u000aThere is disagreement among Indian and Tibetan doxographers as to how to categorise Dharmak\u012brti's thought. The Gelug school asserts that he expressed Yogacara views, most non-Gelug Tibetan commentators assert that he expressed Sautr\u0101ntika views and, according to one Tibetan source, a number of renowned later Indian Madhyamikas asserted that he expressed Madhyamaka views.\u000aAmong modern scholars, some like Tillemans argue that Dharmak\u012brti represented the Yogacara school, while Amar Singh argues that he was a Sautr\u0101ntika. For Christine Mullikin Keyt, Dharmak\u012brti represents a "synthesis of two schools of Indian Buddhism, the Sautrantika and the Yogacara." Likewise, Dan Arnold argues that Dharmak\u012brti's alternating philosophical perspectives of Sautrantika and Yogacara views are ultimately compatible and are applied at different levels of his \u2018sliding scale of analysis.\u2019\u000aThere is also a tendency to see Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti as founding a new type of Buddhist school or tradition, which is known in Tibetan as "those who follow reasoning" (rigs pa rjes su \u2018brang ba) and sometimes is known in modern literature as pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Writings and Commentaries ==\u000aDharmak\u012brti is credited with the following major works:\u000aSa\u1e43bandhaparik\u1e63h\u0101vrtti (Analysis of Relations)\u000aPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya (Ascertainment of Valid Cognition)\u000aPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikak\u0101rika (Commentary on Dignaga's 'Compendium of Valid Cognition')\u000aPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvavrtti (Auto-commentary on the above text)\u000aNy\u0101yabinduprakara\u1e47a (Drop of Logic)\u000aHetubindun\u0101maprakara\u1e47a (Drop of Reason)\u000aSa\u1e43t\u0101n\u0101ntarasiddhin\u0101maprakara\u1e47a (Proof of Others' Mindstreams)\u000aV\u0101dany\u0101yan\u0101maprakara\u1e47a (Reasoning for Debate)\u000aThere are various commentaries by later thinkers on Dharmak\u012brti, the earliest commentators are the Indian scholars Devendrabuddhi (ca. 675 C E.) and Sakyabuddhi (ca. 700 C.E.). Other Indian commentators include Kar\u1e47akagomin, Prajñ\u0101karagupta, Manorathanandin, Ravigupta and \u015aa\u1e45karanandana.\u000aHe was extremely influential in Tibet, where Cha-ba (phya pa chos kyi seng ge, 1182-1251) wrote the first summary of his works, called "Clearing of Mental Obscuration with Respect to the Seven Treatises on Valid Cognition" (tshad ma sde bdun yid gi mun sel). Sakya Pandita (sa skya pandita) wrote the "Treasure on the Science of Valid Cognition" (tshad ma rigs gter) and interpreted Dharmakirti as an anti-realist against Cha-ba's realism. These two main interpretations of Dharmak\u012brti became the foundation for most debates in Tibetan epistemology.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aPramana\u000aBuddhist atomism\u000aEpistemology\u000aDign\u0101ga\u000aWilliam of Ockham\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sources ===\u000aEltschinger, Vincent (2010).
