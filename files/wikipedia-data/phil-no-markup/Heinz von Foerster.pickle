VHeinz von Foerster (German spelling: Heinz von Förster; November 13, 1911, Vienna \u2013 October 2, 2002, Pescadero, California) was an Austrian American scientist combining physics and philosophy, and widely attributed as the originator of Second-order cybernetics. He was twice a Guggenheim fellow (1956\u201357 and 1963\u201364) and also was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1980. He is well known for his 1960 Doomsday equation formula published in Science predicting future population growth.\u000aAs a polymath, he wrote nearly two hundred professional papers, gaining renown in fields from computer science and artificial intelligence to epistemology, and researched high-speed electronics and electro-optics switching devices as a physicist, and in biophysics, the study of memory and knowledge. He worked on cognition based on neurophysiology, mathematics, and philosophy and was called "one of the most consequential thinkers in the history of cybernetics". He came to the United States, and stayed after meeting with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, where he received funding from The Pentagon to established the Biological Computer Laboratory, which built the first parallel computer, the Numa-Rete. Working with William Ross Ashby, one of the original Ratio Club members, and together with Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann and Lawrence J. Fogel, Heinz von Foerster was an architect of cybernetics and one of the members of the Macy conferences, eventually becoming editor of its early proceedings alongside Hans-Lukas Teuber and Margaret Mead.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aVon Foerster was born in 1911 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, as Heinz von Förster. He was the grandson of Austrian architect Emil Ritter von Foerster. He studied physics at the Technical University of Vienna and at the University of Breslau, where in 1944 he received a Ph.D. in physics. His relatives included Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Lang and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Ludwig Förster was his great-grandfather.\u000aHe moved to the USA in 1949, and worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was a professor of electrical engineering from 1951\u20131975. He also was professor of biophysics (1962\u20131975) and Director of the Biological Computer Laboratory (1958\u20131975). Additionally, in 1956\u201357 and 1963\u201364 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and also President of the Wenner-Gren-Foundation for anthropological research from 1963\u20131965.\u000aHe knew well and was in conversation with John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Gordon Pask, Gregory Bateson, Lawrence J. Fogel and Margaret Mead, among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aVon Foerster was influenced by the Vienna Circle and Ludwig Wittgenstein. He worked in the field of cybernetics and is known as the inventor of second-order cybernetics. He made important contributions to constructivism. He is also known for his interest in computer music and magic.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The electron tube laboratory ===\u000aIn 1949 von Foerster started work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded Joseph Tykoci\u0144ski-Tykociner. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high-frequency electronics\u000aHe also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and developed a general model now called the "von Foerster Equation"\u000aThe mathematical formula can be derived from first principles and reads:\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              n\u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              t\u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a        +\u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              n\u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              a\u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a        =\u000a        \u2212\u000a        m\u000a        (\u000a        a\u000a        )\u000a        n\u000a        ,\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle {\u005cfrac {\u005cpartial n}{\u005cpartial t}}+{\u005cfrac {\u005cpartial n}{\u005cpartial a}}=-m(a)n,}\u000a  \u000awhere: n = n(t,a), t stands for time and a for age. m(a) is the death in function of the population age; n(t,a) is the population density in function of age.\u000aWhen m(a) = 0, we have:\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              n\u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              t\u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a        =\u000a        \u2212\u000a        \u000a          \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              n\u000a            \u000a            \u000a              \u2202\u000a              a\u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle {\u005cfrac {\u005cpartial n}{\u005cpartial t}}=-{\u005cfrac {\u005cpartial n}{\u005cpartial a}}}\u000a  \u000aIt relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out.\u000aIt is therefore a transport equation; it can be solved using a characteristics method. Another way is by similarity solution; and a third is a numerical approach such as finite differences.\u000aTo get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added:\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        n\u000a        (\u000a        t\u000a        ,\u000a        0\u000a        )\u000a        =\u000a        \u000a          \u222b\u000a          \u000a            0\u000a          \u000a          \u000a            \u221e\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        b\u000a        (\u000a        a\u000a        )\u000a        n\u000a        (\u000a        t\u000a        ,\u000a        a\u000a        )\u000a        \u000a        d\u000a        t\u000a        ,\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle n(t,0)=\u005cint _{0}^{\u005cinfty }b(a)n(t,a)\u005c,dt,}\u000a  \u000awhich states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe\u2013Lotka\u2013McKendrick\u2019s equation for otherwise), and that\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        n\u000a        (\u000a        0\u000a        ,\u000a        a\u000a        )\u000a        =\u000a        f\u000a        (\u000a        a\u000a        )\u000a        ,\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle n(0,a)=f(a),\u005c,}\u000a  \u000awhich states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Biological Computer Laboratory ===\u000aIn 1958 he formed the Biological Computer Lab, studying similarities in cybernetic systems in biology and electronics.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Macy conferences ===\u000aHe was the youngest member of the core group of the Macy conferences on Cybernetics and editor of the five volumes of Cybernetics (1949\u20131953), a series of conference transcripts that represent important foundational conversations in the field. It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage "Cybernetics" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called "Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Doomsday equation ===\u000aA 1960 issue of Science magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula. The formula gave 2.7 billion as the 1960 world population and predicted that population growth would become infinite by Friday, November 13, 2026 \u2013 von Foerster's 115th birthday anniversary \u2013 a prediction that earned it the name "the Doomsday Equation."\u000aBased on population data obtained from various sources, von Foerster and his students concluded that world population growth over the centuries was faster than an exponential. In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.\u000aResponders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Doomsday Equation: recent research ====\u000aThe hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s has recently been correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows:\u000atechnological growth implies an increase in carrying capacity, an increase in the number of people who can survive on any given plot of land\u000ademographic growth (more people) implies more potential inventors and hence an acceleration of technological growth\u000aaccelerating technological growth causes accelerating growth of carrying capacity, in a positive feedback loop\u000afaster population growth likewise feeds back by accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors, and then even faster technological growth\u000ahence, even faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aLogarithmic timeline\u000aDas Netz: interview with von Foerster, 2003\u000aMacy conferences\u000aPower law: The equation that he derived for the date calculated is one that nowadays is called a power law.\u000aList of dates predicted for apocalyptic events\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000aVon Foerster authored more than 100 publications.
