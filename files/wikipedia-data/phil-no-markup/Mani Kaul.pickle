It marked a drastic departure from earlier Indian cinema technique, form and narrative. It was one of the early formal experimental films in Indian cinema.\u000aAshadh Ka Ek Din (1971), his next film, was based on a play by Mohan Rakesh.\u000aDuvidha, his third film, was his first in colour. It grew out of a short story by Vijaydan Detha and tells the story of a merchant's son, who returns with his new bride. When he departs on a business trip, a ghost falls in love with the wife. It was widely shown across Europe. He was awarded the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1974.\u000aKaul was one of the co-founders of the Yukt Film Co-operative (Union of Kinematograph Technicians) in 1976, leading to avant-garde films. Critics opined in "Mani Kaul's cinematic conception, fiction and documentary films have no clear demarcated dividing line." He also taught music in the Netherlands, and was Creative Director of the film house at Osian's Connoisseurs of Art, Mumbai.\u000aIn 1971, he was a member of the jury at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival.\u000aHe was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University for the 2000\u20132001 school year.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Death ==\u000aMani Kaul died on 6 July 2011 at his home in Gurgaon, near Delhi, after prolonged battle with cancer. He is survived by two sons and two daughters.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Tribute ==\u000aAccording to a tribute from Prabha Mahajan on the Indian documentary film discussion network Docuwallahs2 [1], Mani Kaul's significant body of work included both feature films and documentaries. In an interview Mani stated: "The dividing line from my films and documentaries is thin. Some of my films like Siddheshwari are like poetic documentaries." Mani Kaul's fellow alumni from FTII intend to put together a collective tribute to Mani Kaul and his work, and interested persons were invited to send in their thoughts on Mani as a film maker, teacher/ mentor, colleague, and as a person.\u000aIndian film critic Khalid Mohamed commented, "As a film director, he discussed the status of women (Uski Roti, Duvidha), crafted visually seductive documentaries (Arrival, Before My Eyes, A Desert of a Thousand Lines) and went through a spell of interpreting Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s masterworks. The Russian writer\u2019s short story A Gentle Creature inspired Nazar, shot in low, chiaroscuro lighting."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Filmography ==\u000aUski Roti (1969)\u000aAshadh Ka Ek Din (1971)\u000aDuvidha (1973)\u000aPuppeteers of Rajasthan (Documentary) (1974)\u000aA Historical Sketch of Indian Women (Documentary) 1975\u000aChitrakathi (Documentary) (1977)\u000aGhashiram Kotwal (1979)\u000aArrival (Documentary) (1980)\u000aSatah Se Uthata Admi (1980)\u000aDhrupad (film) (1982)\u000aMati Manas (Documentary) (1984)\u000aA Desert of a Thousand Lines (Documentary) (1986)\u000aBefore My Eyes (Documentary)(1989)\u000aSiddheshwari (Documentary) (1989)\u000aNazar (1991)\u000aIdiot (1992)\u000aThe Cloud Door (1995)\u000aNaukar Ki Kameez (The Servant's Shirt) (1999)\u000aBojh (Burden)(2000)\u000aIk Ben Geen Ander (I Am No Other) Nederland 2002\u000aA Monkey's Raincoat Nederland (2005)\u000aSignature Film for Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema (2006)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== National Film Awards ===\u000a1974: Best Direction: Duvidha\u000a1989: Best Documentary Film: Siddheshwari\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Filmfare Awards ===\u000aMani Kaul won Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie four times.\u000a1971: Uski Roti (1970)\u000a1972: Ashad Ka Ek Din (1971)\u000a1974: Duvidha (1973)\u000a1993: Idiot (1992)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aAvijit Ghosh, "He was, by far, our most original filmmaker" The Times of India.\u000aMani Kaul at the Internet Movie Database\u000aMani Kaul on Cinematography and Time at Indian Auteur\u000aThe Films of Mani Kaul\u000aAn Interview with Mani Kaul
