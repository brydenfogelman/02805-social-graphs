VMarilyn McCord Adams (born 1943) is an American philosopher and priest of the Episcopal Church. She specialises in philosophy of religion, philosophical theology and medieval philosophy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Family ==\u000aAdams is the daughter of William Clark McCord and Wilmah Brown McCord. In 1966, she married the philosopher Robert Merrihew Adams.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000aAdams was educated at the University of Illinois (AB); Cornell University (PhD 1967); and Princeton Theological Seminary (ThM 1984, 1985); and holds the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford (2008).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aAdams is Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University. Before that she was, in reverse chronological order, Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford University, the Horace Tracy Pitkin Professor of Historical Theology at Yale University, and a Professor of Philosophy at UCLA. She is also a former President of the Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy.

Her work on the problem of evil largely focuses on what she calls "horrendous evils". She is an avowed Christian universalist, believing that ultimately all will receive salvation and restoration in Christ:\u000a\u000aTraditional doctrines of hell err again by supposing either that God does not get what God wants with every human being ("God wills all humans to be saved" by God's antecedent will) or that God deliberately creates some for ruin. To be sure, many human beings have conducted their ante-mortem lives in such a way as to become anti-social persons. Almost none of us dies with all the virtues needed to be fit for heaven. Traditional doctrines of hell suppose that God lacks the will or the patience or the resourcefulness to civilize each and all of us, to rear each and all of us up into the household of God. They conclude that God is left with the option of merely human penal systems \u2013 viz., liquidation or quarantine!\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aAdams, Marilyn McCord.
