VRichard Milton Martin (1916, Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 22 November 1985, Milton, Massachusetts) was an American logician and analytic philosopher. In his Ph.D. thesis written under Frederic Fitch, Martin discovered virtual sets a bit before Quine, and was possibly the first non-Pole other than Joseph Henry Woodger to employ a mereological system. Building on these and other devices, Martin forged a first-order theory capable of expressing its own syntax as well as some semantics and pragmatics (via an event logic), all while abstaining from set and model theory (consistent with his nominalist principles), and from intensional notions such as modality.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aMartin was educated as follows:\u000aB.A. Harvard, philosophy, 1941;\u000aM.A. Columbia, 1941;\u000aPh.D. Yale, philosophy, 1952.\u000aMartin studied under Alfred North Whitehead, then in his last year at Harvard, and may have studied under Ernest Nagel at Columbia.\u000aDuring WWII, Martin taught mathematics at Princeton University, then at the University of Chicago. After the war, he taught philosophy at Bryn Mawr College 1946\u201348, the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) 1948\u201359, the University of Texas 1959\u201363, New York University 1963\u201373, Northwestern 1973\u201376 (full-time) and 1976\u201385 (one course per year). Martin also held visiting appointments at Bonn, Yale, Hamburg, the New School, and Temple.\u000aIn 1976, Martin largely retired from teaching, becoming a research associate with Boston University\u2019s Center for the History and Philosophy of Science. He made excellent use of the resulting leisure, so that his final decade of life was by far his most productive, publishing over 100 book chapters and journal articles. In 1979, he published the definitive treatment of his logic / first-order theory, Part A of Semiotics, and edited a volume of Carolyn Eisele\u2019s writings on Charles Sanders Peirce. He helped edit the Festschrift books for Fitch and J. N. Findlay, respectively, published in 1975 and 1985.\u000aAt the time of his death, Martin served on the editorial board of eight journals and on the advisory board of the Peirce Edition Project. In 1981, he became president of the Charles S. Peirce Society. In 1984, he was elected president of the Metaphysical Society of America.\u000aDespite having held tenure track appointments from 1948 until his death, the only Ph.D. thesis known to have been completed under Martin\u2019s supervision is that of James Scoggin. Otherwise, Martin\u2019s legacy is coextensive with his published writings.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ideas ==\u000a"\u2026one of the most many-sided, prolific, and scholarly of analytic philosophers."\u000a\u2014Hans Burkhardt, Foreword to Metaphysical.\u000aMartin was part of the first wave of American analytic philosophers; arguably, only Quine (1908\u20132000), Fitch (1909\u20131987), and Henry Leonard (1905\u201367) preceded him. His chronological elders Nelson Goodman (1906\u20131998) and Wilfrid Sellars (1912\u201389) were arguably his contemporaries, as they all began their careers in earnest at about the same time, namely right after WWII. Martin's formal treatment of syntax followed Alfred Tarski; of semantics, Rudolf Carnap. Martin was generally well-disposed towards Carnap's work, contributed a long paper to the Schilpp volume on Carnap, and was seen as a disciple. Paradoxically, Martin was a positivist and radical nominalist who also sympathized with process theology and orthodox Christianity.\u000aBetween 1943 and 1992, Martin published 16 books and about 240 papers (of which 179 were included in his books) on an extraordinary range of subjects, including aesthetics, logic, the foundation of mathematics, metaphysics, syntax/semantics/pragmatics, the philosophy of science, phenomenology, process philosophy, theology, Frege, and Charles Sanders Peirce. Martin preached and practiced that philosophy should be done formally, by employing first-order logic, the theory of virtual sets and relations, and a multiplicity of predicates, all culminating in an event logic. Starting with the papers reprinted in his 1969 Belief, Martin argued that the Frege's Art des Gegebensein was crucial to his thinking. Just what this Art entailed remains to be elucidated.\u000aMartin was especially fond of applying his first-order theory to the analysis of ordinary language, a method he termed logico-linguistics. He often referenced the work of the linguists Zellig Harris (admiringly) and Henry Hiz (more critically); Martin, Harris, and Hiz all taught at Penn in the 1950s. Yet Martin was dismissive of the related theoretical work by Noam Chomsky and his MIT colleagues and students. Ironically, Martin appears to have been Chomsky's main teacher of logic; while a student at Penn, Chomsky took every course Martin taught.\u000aQuine's Word and Object cites Martin with approval, but Martin's wider impact has not been commensurate with the breadth and depth of his writings; the secondary literature on Martin consists of little more than reviews of his books. This silence, as puzzling as it is broad-based, begs elucidation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Quotations ==\u000a\u201cOver the portals of the entrance to contemporary philosophy is writ: Enter here fully equipped with the tools of the new logic.\u201d Intension, p. 153.\u000a\u201cGod made first-order logic and all the rest is the handiwork of man.\u201d Semiotics, p. xv.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aThe first four titles below and Part A of Semiotics are monographs.
