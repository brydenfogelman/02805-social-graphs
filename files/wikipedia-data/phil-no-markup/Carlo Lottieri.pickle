He holds a bachelor's degree (summa cum laude) in Philosophy from the University of Genoa, a M.A. from the Institut Universitaire d\u2019Etudes Européens (now attached to the University of Geneva), a M.A. and a Ph.D. from the Paris-Sorbonne University. His research interests cover Philosophy of Law, Federalism, Libertarianism, Political Theology, Religion and Public Life, Military Ethics, Elitism, Evolutionary Theory of Law, Commons and Private Property, Modern State. He edited many works by Bruno Leoni in English, French, Italian, Spanish and Czech.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career and thought ==\u000aHe is currently Professor of Political Philosophy at the University of Siena and Professor of Philosophy of Law and Philosophy of Social Sciences at Facoltà di Teologia di Lugano. In the years 2003-2004 he taught Philosophy of Social Sciences at Ca' Foscari University of Venice and in 2011 he has been visiting professor at Aix-en-Provence. Fellow of many institutions, he is the Director of Political Theory department of the Istituto Bruno Leoni (IBL), based in Turin. Lottieri's research develops a radical libertarianism combining a strong emphasis on the inviolability of other people (marked by the influence of Emmanuel Lévinas) and a realistic approach to the modern State, largely influenced by Italian elitist school, Carl Schmitt's scholarship and Public Choice and Austrian School economists. Following Raimondo Cubeddu and Alberto Mingardi, in his work Lottieri "argues for the legitimacy of many so-called 'monopolistic practices' (cartels, monopolization, mergers, predatory pricing\u2026), and for the legitimacy of conglomerates, and big business at large, vis-à-vis those governmental agencies built to thoroughly implement 'competition' from top to bottom". His last book emphasizes the historic features of the modern State, suggesting to libertarian scholars to understand the cultural and even theological implications of the struggle between the rulers and the ruled.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Single-authored books ===\u000aEvery New Right Is A Freedom Lost. e-book, translated by Chiara Brown, 2016.\u000aCredere nello Stato?
