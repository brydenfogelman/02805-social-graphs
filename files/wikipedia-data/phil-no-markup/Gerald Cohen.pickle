VGerald Allan "Jerry" Cohen, FBA (14 April 1941 \u2013 5 August 2009) was a Marxist political philosopher who held the positions of Quain Professor of Jurisprudence, University College London and Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory, All Souls College, Oxford. Born into a communist family in Montreal, Cohen was educated at McGill University, Canada (BA, philosophy and political science) and the University of Oxford (BPhil, philosophy) where he studied under Isaiah Berlin and Gilbert Ryle.\u000aCohen was assistant lecturer (1963\u20131964), lecturer (1964\u20131979) then reader (1979\u20131984) in the Department of Philosophy at University College London, before being appointed to the Chichele chair at Oxford in 1985. Several of his students, such as Alan Carter, Cécile Fabre, Will Kymlicka, John McMurtry, David Leopold, Michael Otsuka, Seana Shiffrin, Jonathan Wolff and Michael E. Rosen have gone on to be important moral and political philosophers in their own right.\u000aKnown as a proponent of Analytical Marxism and a founding member of the September Group, Cohen's 1978 work Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence defends an interpretation of Marx's historical materialism often referred to as 'technological determinism' by its critics. In Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality, Cohen offers an extensive moral argument in favour of socialism, contrasting his views with those of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, by articulating an extensive critique of the Lockean principle of self-ownership as well as the use of that principle to defend right \u2013 as well as left \u2013 libertarianism. In If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich? (which covers the topic of his Gifford Lectures) Cohen addresses the question of what egalitarian political principles imply for the personal behaviour of those who subscribe to them.\u000aCohen was close friends with Marxist political philosopher Marshall Berman.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aKarl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence (1978, 2000)\u000aHistory, Labour, and Freedom (1988)\u000aSelf-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality.
