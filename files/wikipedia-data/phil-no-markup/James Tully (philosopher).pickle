VJames Hamilton Tully (born 1946) is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Law, Indigenous Governance and Philosophy at the University of Victoria, Canada. His research and teaching comprise a public philosophy that is grounded in place (Canada) yet reaches out to the world of civic engagement with the problems of our time. He does this in ways that strive to contribute to dialogue between academics and citizens. For example, his research areas include the Canadian experience of coping with the deep diversity of multicultural and multinational citizenship; relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous people; and the emergence of citizenship of the living earth as the ground of sustainable futures.\u000aTully is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and Emeritus Fellow of the Trudeau Foundation. In May 2014, he was awarded the University of Victoria\u2019s David H. Turpin Gold Medal for Career Achievement in Research. In 2011, he received the Thousand Waves Peacemaker Award. In 2010, he was awarded the prestigious Killam prize in recognition of his distinguished career and exceptional contributions to Canadian scholarship and public life. Also in 2010, he was awarded the C.B. Macpherson Prize by the Canadian Political Science Association for the "best book in political theory written in English or French" in Canada 2008-10 for his 2008 two-volume Public Philosophy in a New Key.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aJames Tully is one of the four general editors of the Cambridge University Press Ideas in Context Series. He first gained his reputation for his scholarship on the political philosophy of John Locke, and has written on constitutionalism, diversity, indigenous politics, recognition theory, multiculturalism, and the problem of imperialism. He was special advisor to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1991\u20131995).\u000aTully has held positions at McGill University, the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Oxford University, and the University of Victoria.\u000aAfter completing his BA at the University of British Columbia and PhD at Cambridge University, he taught in the departments of Philosophy and Political Science at McGill University 1977-1996. He was Professor and Chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria 1996-2001. In 2001-2003 he was the inaugural Henry N.R. Jackman Distinguished Professor in Philosophical Studies at the University of Toronto in the departments of Philosophy and Political Science and the Faculty of Law. He returned to the University of Victoria in 2003, where he is now the Distinguished Professor of Political Science, Law, Indigenous Governance and Philosophy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Political Philosophy ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Renewing and transforming public philosophy ===\u000aTully\u2019s approach to the study and teaching of politics is a form of historical and critical reflection on problems of political practice in the present. It is an attempt to renew and transform the tradition of public philosophy so it can effectively address the pressing political problems of our age in a genuinely democratic way. It does this by means of a dual dialogue of reciprocal and mutual learning among equals: between academics in different disciplines addressing the same problems (multidisciplinary); and between academics and citizens addressing the problems and struggles on the ground by their own ways of knowing and doing (democratic). The aim is to throw critical light on contemporary political problems by means of studies that free us to some extent from hegemonic ways of thinking and acting politically, enabling us to test their limits and to see and consider the concrete possibilities of thinking and acting differently.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The politics of cultural recognition ===\u000a\u000aTully\u2019s 1995, Strange Multiplicity: Constitutionalism in an Age of Diversity engages with the famous indigenous sculpture Spirit of Haida Gwaii by Bill Reid as a metaphor for the kind of democratic constitutionalism that can help reconcile the competing claims of multicultural and multinational societies. The \u2018strange multiplicity\u2019 of cultural diversity is embodied in the varied and assorted canoe passengers \u201csquabbling and vying for recognition and position.\u201d There is no universal constitutional order imposed from above nor a single category of citizenship, because identities and relations change over time. This view rejects the \u201cmythic unity of the community\u201d imagined \u201cin liberal and nationalist constitutionalism.\u201d\u000aTully argues that the concept of \u2018culture\u2019 is more flexible and constructive for thinking about the rival claims of political groups than the more rigid and exclusive concept \u2018nation.\u2019 Culture more readily suggests that group identities are plural, overlapping, and changing over time in their encounters with others. Unlike nationalism, the politics of cultural recognition does not assume that every group aspires to its own culturally homogenous \u2018nation-state.\u2019 Rather, cultures must find ways to share spaces and co-exist. While they may always strive to determine their own identities and relations, pursuant to \u201cself rule, the oldest political good in the world,\u201d the solution is not to crack down on diversity or to impose one cultural model over others.\u000aThe solution is to broaden opportunities for participation and contestation, to further democratize institutions and relations of governance, including foundational constitutions. According to Tully, \u201ca constitution should not be seen as a fixed set of rules but, rather, as an imperfect form of accommodation of the diverse members of a political association that is always open to negotiation by the members of the association.\u201d No aspect of relations should be off limits to deliberation if called into question by participants affected by those relations. This is what Tully means by \u201cdemocratic constitutionalism\u201d as opposed to more conventional \u201cconstitutional democracy.\u201d From this perspective, Tully can claim that \u201c[t]he constitution is thus one area of modern politics that has not been democratised over the last three hundred years.\u201d\u000aFor Tully, The Spirit of Haida Gwaii prefigures a more democratic, pluralistic, and just society. It evokes a simpler, more elegant, and sustainable ethos of gift-reciprocity in all our relationships, human and non-human. Getting along may be messy and imperfect business, but the passengers continue to row cooperatively, and the canoe of society glides onward.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Practices of civic freedom and global citizenship ===\u000aIn Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom, and Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom (2008), Tully expands his approach \u201cto a broader range of contemporary struggles: over diverse forms of recognition, social justice, the environment and imperialism.\u201d The two volumes mark a shift toward a principal emphasis on freedom. \u201cThe primary question,\u201d Tully writes, \u201cis thus not recognition, identity or difference, but freedom; the freedom of the members of an open society to change the constitutional rules of mutual recognition and association from time to time as their identities change.\u201d This is \u201ccivic freedom,\u201d referring to the capacity people have to participate in the constitution of their own governance relations.\u000aTo the extent that governance relations restrict this basic freedom, \u201cthey constitute a structure of domination, the members are not self-determining, and the society is unfree." Conditions of oppression, however, do not rule out or discount practices of civic freedom. Tully\u2019s public philosophy is not concerned with ideal conditions or hoped-for peaceful futures. Rather, civic freedom exists in conduct and in relations in the \u201chere and now,\u201d not least under conditions of oppression and conflict. Against violence and tyranny, Tully argues, practices of civic freedom make the best \u201cstrategies of confrontation,\u201d because they generate conditions for transformative change. The concluding chapter of Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II examines \u201cthe democratic means to challenge and transform imperial relationships [and] brings together the three themes of the two volumes: public philosophy, practices of civic freedom and the countless ways they work together to negotiate and transform oppressive relationships.\u201d\u000aTully\u2019s civics-based approach offers a new way of thinking about a diverse array of contemporary and historical traditions of democratic struggle, including environmental movements and indigenous struggle. Tully summarizes the approach and its potential:\u000a\u000a\u2018Practices of civic freedom\u2019 comprise the vast repertoire of ways of citizens acting together on the field of governance relationships and against the oppressive and unjust dimensions of them. These range from ways of \u2018acting otherwise\u2019 within the space of governance relationships to contesting, negotiating, confronting and seeking to transform them. The general aim of these diverse civic activities is to bring oppressive and unjust governance relationships under the on-going shared authority of the citizenry subject to them; namely, to civicise and democratize them from below.\u000a\u000aFrom this perspective, these kinds of powerful, civic movements are not deviations or anomalies to be corrected or appeased through discipline or cooptation, but exemplars of civic freedom. They disclose their positions or grievances not only through words and stated goals but through the very world they bring into being by their actions: civic \u201cactivists have to be the change that they wish to bring about.\u201d \u201cUnderlying this way of democratization,\u201d Tully argues, \u201cis the Gandhian premise that democracy and peace can be brought about only by democratic and peaceful means.\u201d However, this is no utopian vision, according to Tully, referring to the \u201cthousands\u201d and \u201cmillions of examples of civic\u201d practices everyday that make another world not only possible but \u201cactual.\u201d\u000aTo clarify and reinforce this approach, Tully argues for an expanded conception of the term citizenship to encompass all forms of governance-related conduct, with an emphasis on \u201cnegotiated practices.\u201d Civic or global citizenship refers to the myriad of relations and practices (global and local) people find themselves embedded and participating in. The term global draws attention to the diverse and overlapping character of governance \u2014 and hence citizen \u2014 relations. Modes of civic and global citizenship \u201care the means by which cooperative practices of self-government can be brought into being and the means by which unjust practices of governance can be challenged, reformed and transformed by those who suffer under them.\u201d\u000aTully carefully distinguishes his expanded notion of citizenship (diverse, cooperative, civic, global) from the narrower but more conventional notion of citizenship, which he calls \u201ccivil citizenship\u201d (modern, institutional, and international). Where civic denotes practice and pluralism, civil citizenship singularly refers to \u201ca status given by the institutions of the modern constitutional state in international law.\u201d This kind of (civil) citizenship is associated with the dominant tradition of liberalism, in which the state ensures a free market, a set of negative liberties (especially protections against state infringements into the private sphere), and a narrow range of participation through institutions of free speech and representative government. Tully argues that this dominant module of civil citizenship is neither universal nor inevitable; rather, it is \u201cone singular, historical form of citizenship among others.\u201d More problematically, the civil tradition often plays handmaiden to empire, insofar as imperial powers operate under international banners of \u2018progress\u2019 and \u2018liberalism\u2019:\u000a\u000athe dominant forms of representative democracy, self-determination and democratisation promoted through international law are not alternatives to imperialism, but, rather, the means through which informal imperialism operates against the wishes of the majority of the population of the post-colonial world.\u000a\u000aBy contextualizing and de-centering, or \u201cprovincializing,\u201d modern categories of \u201callegedly universal\u201d citizenship, Tully aims to broaden and democratize the field of citizenship and citizen practices. \u201cThis [civic and global] mode of citizenship,\u201d he argues, \u201chas the capacity to overcome the imperialism of the present age and bring a democratic world into being.\u201d\u000aMore recently, Tully has emphasized the importance of \u201ccoordinating\u201d the different ways that civil (deliberative) and civic (cooperative) citizens address the same political problems, such as social and ecological justice.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The transformative power of nonviolence ===\u000aIn the closing pages of Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II, Tully explicitly links his work to the study and practice of nonviolence. He identifies four main components of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s life practice of Satyagraha that offer a model for approaching civic freedom and global citizenship practices: 1) noncooperation with unjust institutions, 2) a commitment to nonviolent means of resistance, 3) a focus on local, community-based modes of self-reliance and self-governance, and 4), as a precursor to these three components, \u201cpersonal practices of self-awareness and self-formation.\u201d According to Tully, these cornerstones of nonviolent power \u201care daily practices of becoming an exemplary citizen.\u201d\u000aTully has since focused increasingly on the study and practice nonviolent ethics and nonviolent resistance. For example, he writes,\u000a\u000athe alternative of a politics of reasonable nonviolent cooperation and agonistics (Satyagraha) was discovered in the twentieth century by William James, Gandhi, Abdul Gaffar Khan, Einstein, Ashley Montagu, Bertrand Russell, Martin Luther King Junior, Thomas Merton, Thich Nhat Hanh, Gene Sharp, Petra Kelly, Johan Galtung and Barbara Deming. They argued that the antagonistic premise of western theories of reasonable violence is false. Nonviolent practices of cooperation, disputation and dispute resolution are more basic and prevalent than violent antagonism. This is a central feature of civic freedom.\u000a\u000aA major overlap between Tully\u2019s civic freedom and the study of nonviolence is the shared emphasis on practice, on methods, on means rather than on ends. \u201cFor cooperative citizens,\u201d Tully writes, \u201cmeans and ends are internally related, like a seed to the full-grown plant, as Gandhi put it.\u201d This is because means \u201care pre-figurative or constitutive of ends. Consequently, democratic and peaceful relationships among humans are brought about by democratic and non-violent means."\u000aTully repudiates the \u201cdepressing history\u201d of \u201cself-defeating violent means.\u201d He rejects the idea, prevalent across the spectrum of Western political thought, from revolutionaries to reactionaries (the \u201creigning dogma of the left and right\u201d) that peaceful and democratic societies can be brought about by coercive and violent means. Rather, according to Tully, \u201cthe means of violence and command relationships do not bring about peace and democracy. They too are constitutive means. They bring about security dilemmas and the spiral of the command relations necessary for war preparation, arms races and more violence.\u201d\u000aFor these reasons, Tully extends his civics-based public philosophy to \u201cpractitioners and social scientists [who] are beginning to appreciate the transformative power of participatory non-violence and the futility of war in comparison.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sustainability and Gaia citizenship ===\u000aTully\u2019s approach to nonviolent citizenship practices includes relations with the non-human world. Tully argues that Homo Sapiens should see themselves as interdependent civic citizens of the ecological relationships in which they live and breathe and have their being. As such, they have responsibilities to care for and sustain these relationships that, in reciprocity, sustain them and all the other life forms that are interdependent on them.\u000aTully\u2019s "Gaia citizenship" draws on earth sciences and life sciences as well as indigenous traditions. For example, pointing to the work of ecological scientists from Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and Barry Commoner to the Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change, Tully links the unsustainability crisis of the Anthropocene to his own critique of \u201cmodern civil\u201d modes of governmentality (as violent, exploitative, and destructive). Likewise, he points to Indigenous knowledge that conceptualises human interconnectedness with the earth as gift-reciprocity relationships and as a model for social relationships. The famous Indigenous artwork Spirit of Haida Gwaii remains exemplary of democratic and pluralistic ways of thinking and acting \u2013 between humans and the natural environments on which they depend.\u000aTully\u2019s argument is that his account of interdependent agents in relationships of governance and situated freedom can be extended with modifications to describe human situatedness in ecological relationships \u2013 as either giving rise to \u2018virtuous\u2019 or \u2018vicious cycles\u2019, depending on how we act in and on them.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aFreedom and Democracy in an Imperial Context, Dialogues with James Tully (Edited by Robert Nichols, Jakeet Singh), Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-81599-4.
