VJohn Stevens Cabot Abbott (September 19, 1805 \u2013 June 17, 1877), an American historian, pastor, and pedagogical writer, was born in Brunswick, Maine to Jacob and Betsey Abbott.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aHe was a brother of Jacob Abbott, and was associated with him in the management of Abbott's Institute, New York City, and in the preparation of his series of brief historical biographies. Dr. Abbott graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825, prepared for the ministry at Andover Theological Seminary, and between 1830 and 1844, when he retired from the ministry in the Congregational Church, preached successively at Worcester, Roxbury and Nantucket, all in Massachusetts.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Literary career ==\u000aOwing to the success of a little work, The Mother at Home, he devoted himself, from 1844 onwards, to literature.

He is best known as the author of the widely popular History of Napoleon Bonaparte (1855), in which the various elements and episodes in Napoleon's career are described. Abbott takes a very favourable view towards his subject throughout. Also among his principal works are: History of the Civil War in America (1863\u20131866), and The History of Frederick II, Called Frederick the Great (New York, 1871).
