VJohn Barkley Rosser Sr. (December 6, 1907 \u2013 September 5, 1989) was an American logician, a student of Alonzo Church, and known for his part in the Church\u2013Rosser theorem, in lambda calculus. He also developed what is now called the "Rosser sieve", in number theory. He was later director of the Army Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Rosser also authored mathematical textbooks.\u000aIn 1936, he proved Rosser's trick, a stronger version of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem which shows that the requirement for \u03c9-consistency may be weakened to consistency. Rather than using the liar paradox sentence equivalent to "I am not provable," he used a sentence that stated "For every proof of me, there is a shorter proof of my negation".\u000aIn prime number theory, he proved Rosser's theorem.\u000aThe Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox showed that the original lambda calculus was inconsistent.\u000aRosser died of an aneurysm September 5, 1989, at his home in Madison, Wisconsin.\u000aRosser's son, John Barkley Rosser, Jr., is a mathematical economist and professor at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000aA mathematical logic without variables by John Barkley Rosser, Univ.
