VPaul Alexandre René Janet (30 April 1823 \u2013 4 October 1899) was a French philosopher and writer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aBorn in Paris, he became professor of moral philosophy at Bourges (1845\u20131848) and Strasbourg (1848\u20131857), and of logic at the lycée Louis-le-Grand, Paris (1857\u20131864). In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Sorbonne, and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.\u000aHe wrote widely on philosophy, politics and ethics, on idealistic lines: La Famille, Histoire de la philosophie dans l'antiquité et dans le temps moderne, Histoire de la science politique, Philosophie de la Revolution Française, etc. However, in the opinion of 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of Victor Cousin, and through him of G. W. F. Hegel. His principal work, Théorie de la morale, owes much to Immanuel Kant.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Works ===\u000aThe Materialism of the Present Day, a Critique of Dr. Büchner's System ISBN 1152057863\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.
