VHans Köchler (born 18 October 1948) is a retired professor of philosophy at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, and president of the International Progress Organization, a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the United Nations. In his general philosophical outlook he is influenced by Husserl and Heidegger, his legal thinking has been shaped by the approach of Kelsen. Köchler has made contributions to phenomenology  and philosophical anthropology and has developed a hermeneutics of trans-cultural understanding  that has influenced the discourse on the dialogue of civilizations, particularly as regards the relations between Islam and the West. His research in political and legal philosophy\u2014combined with his involvement with the UN\u2014has resulted in a fundamental critique of the state-centered international system and in specific proposals for the democratization of the United Nations Organization and for a viable system of international criminal justice. Köchler has long worked on the philosophical basis of international relations. He came to prominence in the world of international politics when he was nominated by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan as an observer at the Pan Am Flight 103 (Lockerbie) bombing trial.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and academic career ==\u000aIn his student years, Hans Köchler was actively involved as a Board Member of the European Forum Alpbach and established contacts with leading European intellectuals and philosophers such as Manès Sperber, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Rudi Supek of the Praxis school who he invited to his lecture series that he organized from 1969 onwards. At the beginning of the 1970s, he had joined the team around Otto Molden, the founder of the European Forum Alpbach. These were his formative philosophical years; he initially developed an interest in existential philosophy, transcendental philosophy and phenomenology. In particular, he undertook an epistemological critique of Husserl's transcendental idealism] and interpreted Heidegger's philosophy of Being in the sense of social critique, opening up\u2014in the Cold War era\u2014a dialogue with humanist philosophers of the Praxis school in Yugoslavia and in Czechoslovakia. As a doctoral student, he also had met in Alpbach with Ernst Bloch, Arthur Koestler and Karl Popper.\u000aIn 1972, Köchler graduated at the University of Innsbruck with a doctor degree in philosophy (Dr. phil.) with highest honours ("sub auspiciis praesidentis rei publicae"). In the years following his graduation he expanded his scholarly interest to philosophy of law and later political philosophy. Since the early 1970s he has been promoting the idea of inter-cultural dialogue which\u2014since the last decade\u2014has become known under the slogan of dialogue of civilizations. Köchler first outlined his hermeneutical philosophy of dialogue and his concept of cultural self-comprehension in lectures at the University of Innsbruck (1972) and at the Royal Scientific Society in Amman, Jordan, in March 1974  and discussed that notion in a tour around the world (March\u2013April 1974) for which he got support and encouragement from Austrian Foreign Minister Rudolf Kirchschläger (later to become President of Austria) and in the course of which he met with intellectuals and political leaders on all continents. Among his interlocutors were Yussef el-Sebai, Minister of Culture of Egypt, Prof. S. Nurul Hasan, Minister of Education, Social Welfare and Culture of India, Prince Subhadradis Diskul of Thailand, Charoonphan Israngkul Na Ayudhya, Foreign Minister of Thailand, Prof. Ida Bagus Mantra, Director-General for Culture of Indonesia, and the President of Senegal, Léopold Sédar Senghor. In recognition of his contribution to the dialogue among civilizations he received an honorary doctor degree (Doctor of Humanities honoris causa) from the Mindanao State University (Philippines) (2004). In 2012 he received an honorary doctor degree from the Armenian State Pedagogical University.\u000a\u000aIn 1982 he was appointed as University Professor of Philosophy (with special emphasis on Political Philosophy and Philosophical Anthropology) at the University of Innsbruck. From 1990 until 2008 he has served as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Innsbruck (Austria). At his University, Professor Köchler also has acted as Chairperson of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik (Working Group for Sciences and Politics) since 1971; he was a member of the Doctoral Grants Committee of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2000\u20132006) and is Life Fellow\u2014since 2010 Co-President\u2014of the International Academy for Philosophy. Since 2010 he is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Indian Yearbook of International Law and Policy.\u000aAdditional professorships:\u000aVisiting Professor at the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (1998).\u000aVisiting Professorial Lecturer at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Manila (since 2004).\u000aHonorary Professor of Philosophy at Pamukkale University, Turkey (since 2008).\u000aKöchler is the recipient of numerous honours and awards such as the History Medal of the Austrian College Society; the award "Apostle of International Understanding" (Unity International Foundation, India); the Honorary Medal of the International Peace Bureau (Geneva); the Honorary Medal of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines; the Royal Datoship of the Sultanate of Marawi (Muslim Mindanao); the Medal of David the Invincible by the Armenian Philosophical Academy; the Gusi Peace Prize (2014). On 18 October 2003 the Hans Koechler Political and Philosophical Society was established in the Philippines.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Research ==\u000a\u000aDuring the 1970s, he co-operated with Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a of Kraków, later to become Pope John Paul II, within the framework of the International Society for Phenomenology. He published the first comment articles on the future Pope's anthropological conception. During the 1980s he engaged in a critique of legal positivism (Philosophie\u2014Recht\u2014Politik, 1985) and developed a theory according to which human rights are the basis of the validity of international law (Die Prinzipien des Völkerrechts und die Menschenrechte, 1981). He also dealt with the applicability of democracy in inter-state relations (Democracy in International Relations, 1986). Legal theory led him to questions of political philosophy, and in particular a critique of the representative paradigm of democracy. During the 1990s Köchler got increasingly involved in questions of world order\u2014including the role and philosophical foundations of civilizational dialogue\u2014and in what he has called the dialectic relationship between power and law. On the basis of these reflections, he made major proposals for the reform of the United Nations Organization, in particular the Security Council, and for a comprehensive system of international criminal justice.\u000aKöchler's bibliography contains more than 380 books, reports and scholarly articles in several languages (Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Spanish, Serbo-Croat, Turkish). His publications deal with issues of phenomenology, existential philosophy, anthropology, human rights, philosophy of law, theory of international law, international criminal law, United Nations reform, theory of democracy, etc. He acts as editor of the series Studies in International Relations (Vienna), Veröffentlichungen der Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik (Innsbruck), and as member of the Editorial Board of the international academic journal Hekmat va Falsafeh (Wisdom and Philosophy), published by the Philosophy Department of Allameh Tabatabaii University, Iran.\u000aKöchler has served in several committees and expert groups dealing with issues of international democracy, human rights and development such as the Research Network on Transnational Democracy sponsored by the European Commission; the Council of Europe's Expert Group on Democratic Citizenship (1998\u20132000); and the Asia-Europe Foundation\u2019s expert meeting on Cultural, Religious and Social Conceptions of Justice in Asia & Europe (Singapore, 2004).\u000aKöchler calls in his research paper "The \u201cGlobal War on Terror\u201d and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations " presented during the International Roundtable Conference at the University of Sains Malaysia, Centre for Policy Research and International Studies (CenPRIS) Penang, Malaysia, during 13\u201314 December 2007, the "official narrative" of 9/11, told by the American authorities, an "official conspiracy theory". Moreover, he claims that the Western establishment refuses to investigate what really happened on 9/11 and this is part of a collective denial process.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) ==\u000aKöchler is the Founder and President (since 1972) of the International Progress Organization (I.P.O.), an international non-governmental organization (NGO) in consultative status with the United Nations and with a membership in over 70 countries, representing all continents. He was the founder and Secretary-General (1973-1977) of Euregio Alpina (Study Group for the Alpine Region), a transnational planning structure for the Alpine region and predecessor of the new concept of the "Euro Regions" in the framework of the European Union. During the 1970s and 1980s Köchler participated in the international phenomenological movement and organized several conferences and colloquia on the phenomenology of the life-world; he was the organizer of the Eighth International Phenomenological Conference in Salzburg (1980) and is the co-founder of the Austrian Society of Phenomenology. Other activities or functions:\u000aCoordinator of the International Committee for Palestinian Human Rights (ICPHR) (1988\u2013);\u000aCo-founder of the European Ombudsman Institute (1988);\u000aVice-Chairman of the Jamahir Society for Culture and Philosophy and Chairman of the Society's Editorial Board, Vienna (1991\u20132004);\u000aMember of the Board, NGO Committee on Development at the United Nations Center in Vienna (1994\u2013);\u000aMember of the Advisory Council of the International Movement for a Just World (Malaysia) (1997\u2013);\u000aConvenor (Austria) of the International Movement for a Just World (JUST) (1997\u20132004);\u000aMember of the International Advisory Panel of the Center for Civilizational Dialogue at the University of Malaya (Kuala Lumpur) (1997\u2013);\u000aMember of the International Advisory Council of the Committee for a Democratic United Nations, Germany (2003\u2013);\u000aMember of the International Advisory Board of the "Youth for the Alliance of Civilizations," an initiative of the Islamic Conference Youth Forum for Dialogue and Cooperation (2007\u2013).\u000a\u000a\u000a== International impact ==\u000aKöchler has been the organizer of major international conferences in the fields of transnational co-operation, democracy, human rights, terrorism, and conflict resolution, among them the "International Conference on the European Vocation of the Alpine Region" in Innsbruck (1971), which initiated transborder co-operation in Europe and the development towards the "Euro Regions" within the EU; the "International Conference on the Question of Terrorism" in Geneva (1987); and the "Second International Conference On A More Democratic United Nations" (CAMDUN-2) at the Vienna headquarters of the United Nations (1991). In 1996 he acted as Chairman of the final session and co-ordinator of the Drafting Committee of the "International Conference on Democracy and Terrorism" in New Delhi. In March 2002 he delivered the 14th Centenary Lecture at the Supreme Court of the Philippines on "The United Nations, the International Rule of Law and Terrorism." On 1 September 2004 he delivered the Foundation Day Speech at Mindanao State University, Islamic City of Marawi, on "The Dialogue of Civilizations and the Future of World Order."\u000a\u000aThrough his research and civil society initiatives, Professor Köchler made major contributions to the debate on international democracy and United Nations reform, in particular reform of the Security Council. This was acknowledged by international figures such as the German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in 1993. In 1985, he organized the first colloquium on "Democracy in International Relations" on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations in New York. With Irish Nobel Laureate Seán MacBride he initiated the Appeal by Lawyers against Nuclear War, which set in motion an international campaign that eventually led to a General Assembly resolution and the issuing of an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice. As President of the I.P.O. he dealt with the humanitarian issues of the exchange of prisoners of war between Iran and Iraq and with the issue of Kuwaiti POWs and missing people in Iraq. Since 1972, UN Secretaries-General in their statements subsequently acknowledged Professor Köchler's contribution to international peace.\u000a\u000aIn the framework of his activities as President of the International Progress Organization, he co-operated with numerous international figures such as the Founder President of Senegal, Léopold Sédar Senghor, on the issue of civilizational dialogue; Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Cardinal Franz König of Austria on Islamic-Christian understanding; Leo Mates, Secretary-General of the first Non-Aligned summit in Belgrade in 1961, on the principles and future of the non-aligned movement (NAM); Field Marshal Abdul Rahman Sowar el-Dahab, former Head of State of Sudan, on matters of POW exchange and international humanitarian law; Indian President Gyani Zail Singh on issues of international peace; and Sir Thomas Dalyell, former British MP and "Father of the House of Commons," in the case of the criminal investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.\u000aDuring the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy, he wrote in a commentary: "In his lecture preaching the compatibility of reason and faith, Benedict XVI, the scholar, deliberately overlooks the fact that the insights of Greek philosophy \u2013 its commitment to the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u2013 have been brought to medieval Christian Europe by the great Muslim thinkers of the Middle Ages. What he calls the 'encounter between the Biblical message and Greek thought' ... was, to a large extent, the result of the influence of Muslim philosophers \u2013 at a time when European Christians were totally ignorant of classical Greek philosophy."."\u000aKöchler is also an outspoken critic of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and has condemned its inception and practice by citing provisions of international law.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Major works ==\u000aDie Subjekt-Objekt-Dialektik in der transzendentalen Phänomenologie.
