VHorace Romano Harré (/\u02c8hære\u026a/; born 1927), known widely as Rom Harré, is a distinguished British philosopher and psychologist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aHarré was born in Apiti, in northern Manawatu, near Palmerston North, New Zealand, but holds British citizenship. He studied chemical engineering (for which he retains a great affection) and later graduated with a BSc in mathematics (1948) and a Masters in Philosophy (1952), both at the University of New Zealand, now the University of Auckland.\u000aHe taught mathematics at Kings College, Auckland (1948\u201353) and the University of Punjab in Lahore, Pakistan (1953\u20134). He then studied at University College, Oxford, where he completed a B. Phil. under the supervision of J.L. Austin in 1956. After a fellowship at the University of Birmingham he was lecturer at the University of Leicester from 1957 to 1959.\u000aHe returned to Oxford as the successor to Frederick Waismann as University Lecturer in Philosophy of Science in 1960 (age 34). At Oxford he was active in the founding of the Honours School of Physics and Philosophy and played an important part in the discursive turn in social psychology, a field he came to in the middle of his career. After mandatory retirement from Oxford in 1995 he joined the psychology department of Georgetown University, Washington, DC where he continues as Distinguished Research Professor teaching every year in the Spring Semester.\u000aHe has given occasional courses at both American University in Washington, D.C. and at George Mason University at Fairfax, Virginia. From 2009 until 2011 he served as Director Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science at the London School of Economics in conjunction with his US post. He has been Visiting Professor at many places, teaching courses at Aoyama University, Tokyo; Universidad Santiago de Compostella, Spain; Universidad Caetano, Peru; Free University at Brussels; Aarhus University in Denmark and elsewhere.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Intellectual interests ==\u000aHarré is one of the world's most prolific social scientists. Has written on a wide variety of subjects including: philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, ontology, psychology, social psychology, sociology and philosophy. He was an important early influence on the British philosophical movement Critical Realism, publishing Causal Powers with Madden in 1975, the same year as A Realist Theory of Science. He supervised Roy Bhaskar's doctoral studies, and has continued to maintain close involvement with realism. He also supervised Patrick Baert, German Berrios, and Jonathan Smith's doctoral studies, respectively in social theory, history and epistemology of psychiatry, and social psychology. Another one of Harré's distinctive contributions was to the understanding of the social self in microsociology, which he called "ethogenics:" this method attempts to understand the systems of belief or means by which individuals can attach significance to their actions and form their identities, in addition to the structure of rules and cultural resources that underlie these actions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards and festschrifts ==\u000aHonorary doctorate, Massey University, 2012\u000aHonorary doctorate, Helsinki (1986)\u000aHonorary doctorate, Brussels (1986)\u000aHonorary doctorate, Cayetano, Lima, Peru (1998)\u000aHonorary doctorate, Aarhus University, Denmark (1998)\u000aLifetime Achievement Award from the American Psychological Association, Theoretical and Philosophical Psychollgy (2010)\u000aTheodore Sarbin Award for 2014 (American Psychological Association, Div 24).\u000aHarré and his critics (1989) (ed) R.
