VMihailo Markovi\u0107, PhD (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u043e \u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; 24 February 1923 \u2013 7 February 2010) was a Serbian philosopher who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s as a proponent of the Praxis School, a Marxist humanist movement that originated in Yugoslavia.\u000aA co-author of the SANU Memorandum, Markovi\u0107 was a prominent supporter of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in the late 1980s and 1990s. He died in February 2010 in Belgrade, Serbia.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aMarkovi\u0107 was born in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He became a member of the youth organization of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a partisan he actively participated in the struggle for liberation of Yugoslavia during World War II.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Academic career ==\u000aMarkovi\u0107 took a doctorate in philosophy first at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1955, and then another in 1956 at University College London. There he studied logic under A. J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on The Concept of Logic. In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966\u20131967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the University of Pennsylvania, first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972\u201380 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Markovi\u0107 was a co-Chairman of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975\u20131985). He has been a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983.\u000aIn his honour, a collection of articles entitled Philosophy and Society was published in Belgrade in 1987.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Social critic ==\u000aAfter the Resolution of the Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Markovi\u0107 took part in a fierce debate against Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR, published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia.\u000aIn the 1960s Markovi\u0107 became a major proponent of the Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal Praxis. Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Markovi\u0107 was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Markovi\u0107 worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986.\u000aAs a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Markovi\u0107, together with Vasilije Kresti\u0107 and others, wrote the SANU Memorandum, a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Socialist Party of Serbia ==\u000aMarkovi\u0107 was vice-president of the Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's Socialist Party of Serbia from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aRevision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR (1952)\u000aLogic (1956)\u000aFormalism in Contemporary Logic (1957)\u000aDialectical Theory of Meaning, Belgrade 1961\u000aHumanism and Dialectics (1967)\u000aDialektik der Praxis, Humanizm i djalektika, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1968\u000aAtt utveckla socialismen, Stockholm, 1971\u000aFrom Affluence to Praxis (Philosophy and social criticism), Ann Arbor, 1974\u000aThe Contemporary Marx, Nottingham, 1974\u000aPhilosophical Foundations of Science, Belgrade 1982\u000aSelected Works in eight volumes, Belgrade, 1994\u000aFreedom and Praxis, Belgrade 1997\u000aSocial Thought at the Border of Milenia, 1999\u000aStorming the Sky: Memoirs, 2008\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aSimo Elakovi\u0107\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aMihailo Markovi\u0107 Archive\u000aThe Notion of Revolution (in Serbian)\u000aEquality and Freedom (in Serbian)\u000aThe Causes of breaking up of Yugoslavia (in Serbian)\u000aReason and Ethos (in Serbian)\u000aThe Memorandum: Roots of Serbian nationalism: an interview with Mihailo Markovi\u0107 and Vasilije Kresti\u0107\u000aMemorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts: Answer to the Criticisms\u000aBiography and Bibliography of Markovi\u0107 (in Serbian)\u000a1999 NIN article about Mihailo Markovi\u0107 and the Praxis School (in Serbian)\u000aPhilosophy as a Way of Life \u2013 an interview with Mihailo Markovic (in Serbian)\u000aA sort of super-Serb defends Serbian policy \u2013 an interview with Markovic (in English)\u000aA Counter-revolution, and not all that velvety \u2013 an interview with Markovic (in English)\u000aPhilosophy that is Lived \u2013 a tribute to Markovic (in Serbian)
