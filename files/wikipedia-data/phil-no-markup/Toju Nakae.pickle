VToju Nakae (\u4e2d\u6c5f \u85e4\u6a39, Nakae T\u014dju, 21 April 1608 \u2013 11 October 1648) was a Japanese Confucian philosopher known as "the sage of \u014cmi".\u000aNakae was a feudal retainer who lived during the Tokugawa shogunate. He taught that the highest virtue was filial piety (k\u014d), and acted upon this, giving up his official post in 1634 in order to return to his home in Takashima, \u014cmi to care of his mother. He distinguished, however, between sho-k\u014d and dai-k\u014d: lesser and greater filial piety. Sho-k\u014d involves the normal care owed by children to their parents; dai-k\u014d involves the notion that our human parents are themselves the children of the divine parents \u2014 thus, if one's parents are wrong, then one should encourage them to return to virtue.\u000aHe was unusual in believing that his teaching would be useful to women as well as men. While accepting the then standard view of women as usually lacking such virtues as compassion and honesty, he argued: "if a wife's disposition is healthy and pious, obedient, sympathetic and honest, then ... every member of her family will be at peace and the entire household in perfect order."\u000aNakae originally followed the teachings of the Chinese neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, but eventually became more influenced by Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529), who argued for the primacy of human intuition or conscience over intellect: moral improvement arises out of conscience-based action (compare Aristotle's ethics). Nakae added a more religious aspect to Wang's "School of Intuition of Mind", calling the human conscience the "divine light of heaven". Nakae's works also supplied his followers (such as Kumazawa Banzan [1619\u20131691]) with "the moral foundation for political action".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected works ==\u000aIn a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Toju Nakae, OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 130+ works in 200 publications in 5 languages and 740+ library holdings.\u000a\u000a1650 -- Dialogue with the elder (Okina mond\u014d).\u000a\u85e4\u6a39\u907a\u7a3f (1795)\u000a\u7fc1\u554f\u7b54 (1831)\u000a\u85e4\u6a39\u5168\u66f8: \u4e2d\u6c5f\u85e4\u6a39\u5148\u751f\u907a\u7a3f (1893)\u000a\u4e2d\u6c5f\u85e4\u6a39\u6587\u96c6 (1914)\u000a\u5b5d\u7d93\u4e94\u7a2e (1925)\u000aNakae T\u014dju sensei zenshu (1928)\u000a\u9451\u8349; \u9644\u30fb\u6625\u98a8; \u9670\u9a2d (1939)\u000a\u85e4\u6a39\u5148\u751f\u5168\u96c6 (1940)\u000a\u4e2d\u6c5f\u85e4\u6a39\u30fb\u718a\u6ca2\u8543\u5c71\u96c6 (1966)\u000a\u4e2d\u6c5f\u85e4\u6a39 (1974)\u000a\u4e2d\u6c5f\u85e4\u6a39\u30fb\u718a\u6ca2\u8543\u5c71 (1976)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aBodart-Bailey, Beatrice.
