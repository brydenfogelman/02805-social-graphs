VIsrael Meir Kirzner (also Yisroel Mayer Kirzner; born February 13, 1930) is an American economist closely identified with the Austrian School.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aThe son of a well-known rabbi and Talmudist, Kirzner was born in London and came to the United States via South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000aAfter studying with the University of Cape Town, South Africa in 1947\u201348 and with the University of London External Programme in 1950\u201351, Kirzner received his B.A. summa cum laude from Brooklyn College in 1954, an MBA in 1955 and Ph.D. in 1957 from New York University, where he studied under Ludwig von Mises.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Economics ==\u000a\u000aKirzner is emeritus professor of economics at New York University and a leading authority on Ludwig von Mises's thinking and methodology in economics. Kirzner's research on entrepreneurship economics is also widely recognized. His book, Competition and Entrepreneurship criticizes neoclassical theory for its preoccupation with the model of perfect competition, which neglects the important role of the entrepreneur in economic life. Kirzner's work integrating entrepreneurial action into neoclassical economics has been more widely accepted than nearly any other Austrian idea of the late twentieth century. Kirzner's major work is in the economics of knowledge and entrepreneurship and the ethics of markets. Kirzner has said that he agrees with Roger Garrison's statement that Kirzner's work takes the middle ground, as opposed to the recent, more extreme position of some Austrian School economists who deny the relevance of market equilibrium. In 2006, Kirzner received the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research " for developing the economic theory emphasizing the importance of the entrepreneur for economic growth and the functioning of the capitalist process.". Universidad Francisco Marroquín granted him an Honorary Doctorate Degree for his contributions to economic theory.Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín UFM also named its Kirzner Entrepreneurship Center in his honor.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Author ==\u000aSome of his works on economics include:\u000a"Entrepreneurial Discovery and The Competitive Market Process: An Austrian Approach," Journal of Economic Literature.
