Callahan, like his great predecessor, Henry Hazlitt, shows that it does. If the theme of Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson is the indirect effects of intervention in the economy, Callahan's dominant thread is the role of monetary calculation in making possible cooperative activity on a vast scale.\u000a\u000aAccording to economist Richard Ebeling, Callahan's book:\u000a\u000a...neatly explains why socialist central planning must inevitably result in failure because the abolition of private property, market competition, and money prices eliminates the institutional prerequisites for economic calculation, without which the central planner is left with no rational method to determine whether or not the resources under his control are being applied in an efficient manner.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCallahan's blog\u000aArchive of articles on lewrockwell.com\u000aArchive of articles on mises.org\u000aReason contributor profile/archive\u000aArticles on The American Conservative\u000aGene Callahan at Goodreads
