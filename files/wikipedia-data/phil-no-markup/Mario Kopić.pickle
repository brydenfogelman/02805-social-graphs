VMario Kopi\u0107 (born 13 March 1965) is a philosopher, author and translator. His main areas of interest include: History of Ideas, Philosophy of Art, Philosophy of Culture, Phenomenology and Philosophy of Religion.\u000aKopi\u0107 is influenced by and writes extensively on Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Gianni Vattimo, Reiner Schürmann and Du\u0161an Pirjevec. He also translated works by Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, On the Genealogy of Morality), Giorgio Agamben, Gianni Vattimo, Jacques Derrida and Du\u0161an Pirjevec into Croatian.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and work ==\u000aMario Kopi\u0107 was born in Dubrovnik, Croatia. He studied Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the University of Zagreb; Phenomenology and Anthropology at the University of Ljubljana; History of Ideas at the Institute Friedrich Meinecke at the Free University of Berlin (under the mentorship of Ernst Nolte); and Comparative Religion and Anthropology of religion at the Sapienza University of Rome (under the mentorship of Ida Magli).\u000aMario Kopi\u0107's philosophical work is under the influence of the Italian philosophical approach known as pensiero debole or "weak thought", the political thought of Arendt, and the ethical-political thought of late Derrida.\u000aIn his latest works The Unhealable Wound of the World, The Challenges of the Post-metaphysics, Sextant and The Beats of the Other Kopi\u0107 developed a kind of onto-politics of liberal-conservative postmodernism and the post-anthropocentric humanism. For him the world is the space of being as event, and only then the arena of national and social or political conflict. The world, or existence, is our ontological responsibility, which precedes political, judicial and moral responsibility.\u000aKopi\u0107 appears in Igor Ivanov Izi's 1995 film N.E.P.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Published books ==\u000aArt and Philosophy: An Anthology (Filozofija i umjetnost - Antologija), Delo 11-12 /1990, Belgrade 1990.\u000aExperiencing the Margins of the Sense (Isku\u0161avanje rubova smisla: pabirci iz estetike), Dubrovnik 1991.\u000aWith Nietzsche on Europe (S Nietzscheom o Europi), Zagreb 2001.\u000aNietzsche and Evola: The Thought as Destiny (Nietzsche e Evola: il pensiero come destino), Rome 2001.\u000aA Trial to the West (Proces Zapadu), Dubrovnik 2003.
