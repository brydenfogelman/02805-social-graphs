VGaisi Takeuti (\u7af9\u5185 \u5916\u53f2, Takeuchi Gaishi, born January 25, 1926) is a Japanese mathematician, known for his work in proof theory.\u000aAfter graduating from Tokyo University, he went to Princeton to study under Kurt Gödel. He later became a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Takeuti was president (2003-2009) of the Kurt Gödel Society, having worked on the respected book Memoirs of a Proof Theorist: Godel and Other Logicians. His goal was to prove the consistency of the real numbers. To this end, Takeuti's conjecture speculates that a sequent formalisation of second-order logic has cut-elimination. He is also known for his work on ordinal diagrams with Akiko Kino.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000aTakeuti, Gaisi (1953). "On a generalized logic calculus".
