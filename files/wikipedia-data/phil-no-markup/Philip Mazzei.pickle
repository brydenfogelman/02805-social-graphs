VFilippo Mazzei (Italian pronunciation: [mat\u02c8tsei], but sometimes erroneously cited with the name of Philip Mazzie; December 25, 1730 \u2013 March 19, 1816) was an Italian physician. A close friend of Thomas Jefferson, Mazzei acted as an agent to purchase arms for Virginia during the American Revolutionary War.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aMazzei was born Filippo Mazzei in Poggio a Caiano in Tuscany as a son of Domenico and Elisabetta. He studied medicine in Florence and practiced in Italy and the Middle East for several years before moving to London in 1755 to take up a mercantile career as an importer. In London he worked as a teacher of Italian language. While in London he met the Americans Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. While doing work for Franklin, Mazzei shared his idea of importing Tuscan products, wine and olive trees, to the New World. They convinced him to undertake his next venture.\u000aOn September 2, 1773 Mazzei boarded a ship from Livorno to Virginia bringing with him plants, seeds, silkworms, and 10 farmers from Lucca. While visiting Jefferson at his estate, the two became good friends and Jefferson gave Mazzei a large allotment of land for an experimental plantation.Mazzei and Jefferson started what became the first commercial vineyard in the Commonwealth of Virginia. They shared an interest in politics and libertarian values, and maintained an active correspondence for the rest of Mazzei's life.\u000aIn 1779 Mazzei returned to Italy as a secret agent for the state of Virginia. He purchased and shipped arms to them until 1783. After briefly visiting the United States again in 1785, Mazzei travelled throughout Europe promoting Republican ideals. He wrote a political history of the American Revolution, 'Recherches historiques et politiques sur les Etats-Unis de l'Amerique septentrionale", and published it in Paris in 1788. After its publication Mazzei became an unofficial roving ambassador in Europe for American ideas and institutions.\u000aWhile in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth he became attached as a Privy Councilor at the court of King Stanislaus II. There he became acquainted with Polish liberal and constitutional thought, like the works of Wawrzyniec Grzyma\u0142a Go\u015blicki and ideas of Golden Freedoms and Great Sejm. King Stanislaus II appointed Mazzei to be Poland's representative in Paris, where he again met Jefferson.\u000aAfter Poland was partitioned between Russia and Prussia in 1795, Mazzei, along with the rest of the Polish court, was given a pension by the Russian crown. He later spent more time in France, becoming active in the politics of the French Revolution under the Directorate. When Napoleon overthrew that government Mazzei returned to Pisa, Italy. He died there in 1816. After his death the remainder of his family returned to the United States at the urging of Thomas Jefferson. They settled in Massachusetts and Virginia. Mazzei's daughter married a nephew of John Adams.\u000aHe was buried at the Pisa Suburbano Cemetery in Pisa. En Virginia habia casado con la francesa, Marie Hautefenille "Petronille" Martin, viuda del antiguo socio. Ella murio en 1788 en Virginia. Tenian 8 años separados.Luego casa en 1796 a los 66 años Antonia Antoni en Livorno. Tienen una hija llamada Elisabetta, nacida el dia 23/7/1798 en Livorno. Casada por 1817 con Andrea Pini, tenor, natural de Bologna.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mazzei letter ==\u000aMany biographers believe Jefferson and Washington had a falling out over a letter Jefferson sent to Mazzei in Italy, which called Washington's administration "Anglican, monarchical, and aristocratical" as England and claimed that Washington had appointed as military officers "all timid men that prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty ... [I]t would give you a fever were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men who were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have had their heads shorn by the harlot England." The letter was eventually published overseas and then re-translated back into English by Noah Webster and published in the United States.\u000aThis contribution was acknowledged by John F. Kennedy in his book A Nation of Immigrants, in which he states that:\u000a\u000aThe great doctrine 'All men are created equal' and incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson. A few alleged scholars try to discredit Mazzei as the creator of this statement and idea, saying that "there is no mention of it anywhere until after the Declaration was published". This phrase appears in Italian in Mazzei's own hand, written in Italian, several years prior to the writing of the Declaration of Independence. Mazzei and Jefferson often exchanged ideas about true liberty and freedom. No one man can take complete credit for the ideals of American democracy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Legacy ==\u000aA 40-cent United States airmail stamp was issued in 1980 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Mazzei's birth.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAmerican Revolution\u000aPatrick Henry\u000aGeorge Mason\u000aJames Monroe\u000aWilliam Paca\u000aFrancesco Vigo\u000aJohn Page\u000aFounding Fathers of the United States\u000aList of important people in the era of the American Revolution\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mazzei's writings ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== In French ===\u000aFilippo Mazzei: Recherches Historiques et Politiques sur les Etats-Unis de l'Amérique Septentrionale (Historical and Political Enquiries Concerning the United States of North America).
