Buddhist debaters such as Dign\u0101ga wanted to engage in these debates, and also have a way to logically evaluate arguments, but a premise such as "all dogs are mammals" proved problematic for his idealist Yogacara philosophy. Dign\u0101ga was a student of Vasubandhu, and therefore believed that "the dharmas are empty." In other words, there are not universal qualities such as "dog-ness" or "mammal-ness." Such universals would have to be unchanging, and since all things are subject to change and are lacking in essential essence according to his school of philosophy, Dign\u0101ga attempted to find a way to engage in argument within the Nyaya structure without positing through the arguments that there is an essential "dog-ness," or what have you.\u000a\u000aTo do this he employed what is referred to in formal logic in the West as contraposition, or in Sanskrit, Apoha, where one switches the terms and swaps them for their term complement. Therefore, the example premise above, "all dogs are mammals" becomes "all non-mammals are non-dogs." These two statements are logically equivalent. Once this had been done, Dign\u0101ga could make arguments about non-mammals without explicitly positing that mammals have an essential nature. While this move gets off the ground towards his goal, reflection shows that making universal statements about non-mammals still implies that there are mammals who share an essential nature, and everything else, which lacks this "mammal-ness." Still, using this method Dign\u0101ga and other Buddhist logicians were able to further their logical discourse and felt more comfortable engaging in Nyaya structured debates.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000aAmong Dign\u0101ga's works there is ''[[Hetucakra]]'' (The wheel of reason), considered his first work on formal logic, advancing a new form of [[deductive reasoning]]. It may be regarded as a bridge between the older doctrine of ''[[trair\u016bpya]]'' and Dign\u0101ga's own later theory of ''[[vyapti]]'' which is a concept related to the Western notion of [[logical consequence|implication]].\u000a\u000aDign\u0101ga's most important work, the ''[[Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya]]'' (''Compendium of Valid Cognition''), examined perception, language and inferential reasoning. It presents perception as a bare cognition, devoid of conceptualization and sees language as useful fictions created through a process of exclusion ([[Buddhist logic#Doctrine of Anyapoha|Apoha]]).\u000a\u000aOther works include:\u000a\u000a*''[[Alambana]]-par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101'', (''The Treatise on the Objects of Cognition'') \u000a*''Abhidharmako\u015ba-marma-prad\u012bpa'' - a condensed summary of Vasubandhu's seminal work\u000a*A summary of the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrika-prajñ\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 s\u016btra''\u000a*''Trik\u0101la-parik\u1e63a''\u000a*''Ny\u0101ya-mukha''\u000a\u000a==Philosophical school==\u000aDign\u0101ga founded a tradition of Buddhist logic, and this school is sometimes called the "School of Dign\u0101ga" or the "Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti school". In Tibetan it is often called \u201cthose who follow reasoning\u201d (Tibetan: ''rigs pa rjes su \u2018brang ba''); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the [[Sanskrit]] 'pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da', often translated as "the Epistemological School"<ref>Tillemans, Tom, "Dharmak\u012brti", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N.
