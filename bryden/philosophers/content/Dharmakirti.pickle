Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.<ref name=tillemanssep/> In the Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika Dharmak\u012brti defines a pramana as a "reliable cognition". What it means for a cognition to be reliable has been interpreted in different ways. Following commentators like Dharmottara, who define it as meaning that a cognition is able to lead to the obtaining of one's desired object, some modern scholars such as Jose I. Cabezon have interpreted Dharmak\u012brti as defending a form of [[Pragmatism]].<ref>Cabezón, José I., 2000, \u201cTruth in Buddhist Theology,\u201d in R. Jackson and J. Makransky, (eds.), Buddhist Theology, Critical Reflections by Contemporary Buddhist Scholars. London: Curzon, 136\u2013154.</ref> Tillemans sees him as holding to a weak form of [[correspondence theory]], which holds that to "confirm causal efficacy" (''arthakriy\u0101sthiti'') is simply to have a justification that an object of cognition has the causal powers we expected.<ref name=tillemanssep/> That justification comes through a certain kind of perception which is said to be an "intrinsical source of knowledge" (''svata\u1e25 pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya'') which is ultimately reliable. \u000a\u000a[[Dign\u0101ga]] and Dharmak\u012brti also hold that that things as they are in themselves are \u201cineffable\u201d (''avyapade\u015bya''). Language is never about the things in themselves, only about conceptual fictions, hence they are [[nominalists]].<ref name=tillemanssep/>\u000a\u000aDharmak\u012brti also holds that there were certain extraordinary epistemic warrants, such as the words of the Buddha, who was said to be a authoritative/reliable person (''pram\u0101\u1e47apuru\u1e63a'') and also the extraordinary yogic perception (''yogipratyak\u1e63a'').\u000a\u000a===Metaphysics===\u000aAccording to Tom Tillemans, the Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti ideas constitute a [[nominalist]] philosophy and they disagree with the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, by asserting that some entities are real.<ref name=tillemanssep/> Dharmak\u012brti states that the real is only the momentarily existing particular (''svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a''), and any universal (''s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a'') is unreal and a fiction. Dharmak\u012brti writes "whatever has causal powers (''arthakriy\u0101samartha''), that really exists (''param\u0101rthasat'')."<ref name=tillemanssep/> He criticized the Nyaya theory of Universals by arguing that since they have no causal efficacy, they is no rational reason to posit them. \u000a\u000aDharmak\u012brti also defended the theory of momentariness (''k\u1e63a\u1e47ikatva''), which held that dhammas spontaneously perish the moment they arise. Dharmak\u012brti came up with an argument for the theory which stated that since anything that really exists has a causal power, the fact that its causal power is in effect proves it is always changing. For Dharmak\u012brti, nothing could be a cause while remaining the same, and any permanent thing would be causally inert.<ref name=tillemanssep/>\u000a\u000a===Mind===\u000aThe ideas of Dharmak\u012brti also represent some [[Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]] theories of mind.<ref name=tillemanssep/> He defends Dign\u0101ga's theory of consciousness being non-conceptually reflexive (''svasamvitti'', [[svasa\u1e43vedana]]), the idea that an act of intentional consciousness is also aware of itself as aware, it is auto-illuminated.<ref name=tillemanssep/> Consciousness is said to illuminate itself like a lamp that illuminates objects in a room as well as itself. \u000a \u000aDharmak\u012brti's ''Substantiation of Other Mindstreams'' (''Sa\u1e43t\u0101n\u0101ntarasiddhi'') is a treatise on the nature of the [[mindstream]] and Buddhist response to the [[Problem of other minds]]<ref>Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20101110082146/http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/bsa059_u.htm] (accessed: Wednesday 28 October 2009).

The [[Gelug]] school asserts that he expressed [[Yogacara]] views, most non-Gelug Tibetan commentators assert that he expressed [[Sautr\u0101ntika]] views and, according to one Tibetan source, a number of renowned later Indian Madhyamikas asserted that he expressed [[Madhyamaka]] views.<ref>Ngawang Palden in the Sautrantika chapter of his ''Explanation of the Conventional and the Ultimate in the Four Systems of Tenets'' (''Grub mtha' bzhi'i lugs kyi kun rdzob dang don dam pa'i don rnam par bshad pa legs bshad dpyid kyi dpal mo'i glu dbyangs'', New Delhi: Guru Deva, 1972, 39.5\u201339.6) says that some such as Prajñakaragupta, Suryagupta, Shantarakshita, Kamalashila, and Jetari interpret Dharmakirti\u2019s ''Commentary on [Dignaga\u2019s] Compendium of Valid Cognition'' (''Tshad ma rnam 'grel'', ''Pramanavarttika'') as a Madhyamika treatise.
