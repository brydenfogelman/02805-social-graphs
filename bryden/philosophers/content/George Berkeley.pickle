This theory denies the existence of [[matter|material substance]] and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only [[idea]]s in the [[mind]]s of [[perception|perceivers]], and as a result cannot exist without being perceived.

He was educated at [[Kilkenny College]] and attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]], earning a bachelor's degree in 1704 and completing a master's degree in 1707. He remained at Trinity College after completion of his degree as a tutor and Greek lecturer.\u000a\u000aHis earliest publication was on mathematics, but the first that brought him notice was his ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', first published in 1709. In the essay, Berkeley examines visual distance, magnitude, position and problems of sight and touch. While this work raised much controversy at the time, its conclusions are now accepted as an established part of the theory of optics.\u000a\u000aThe next publication to appear was the ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' in 1710, which had great success and gave him a lasting reputation, though few accepted his theory that nothing exists outside the mind. This was followed in 1713 by ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]'', in which he propounded his system of philosophy, the leading principle of which is that the world, as represented by our senses, depends for its existence on being perceived.\u000a\u000aFor this theory, the ''Principles'' gives the exposition and the ''Dialogues'' the defence. One of his main objectives was to combat the prevailing [[materialism]] of his time. The theory was largely received with ridicule, while even those such as [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]], who did acknowledge his "extraordinary genius," were nevertheless convinced that his first principles were false.\u000a\u000a=== England and Europe ===\u000aShortly afterwards, Berkeley visited England and was received into the circle of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] and [[Richard Steele|Steele]]. In the period between 1714 and 1720, he interspersed his academic endeavours with periods of extensive travel in Europe, including one of the most extensive Grand Tours of the length and breadth of Italy ever undertaken.<ref>[[Edward Chaney]], 'George Berkeley's Grand Tours: The Immaterialist as Connoisseur of Art and Architecture', in E. Chaney, ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance,'' 2nd ed. London, Routledge. 2000 ISBN 0714644749</ref> In 1721, he took [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of Ireland]], earning his doctorate in [[divinity]], and once again chose to remain at Trinity College Dublin, lecturing this time in Divinity and in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In 1721/2 he was made [[Dean of Dromore]] and, in 1724, [[Dean of Derry]].\u000a\u000aIn 1723, following her violent quarrel with [[Jonathan Swift]], who had been  her intimate friend for many years,  [[Esther Vanhomrigh]]  (for whom Swift had created the nickname "Vanessa") named Berkeley her co-heir along with the barrister [[Robert Marshall (Irish judge)|Robert Marshall]]; her choice of legatees caused  a good deal of surprise since she did not know either of them well, although Berkeley as a very young man had known her father. Swift said generously that he did not grudge Berkeley his inheritance, much of which vanished in a lawsuit in any event. A story that Berkeley and Marshall disregarded a condition of the inheritance that they must publish the correspondence between Swift and Vanessa is probably untrue.\u000a\u000aIn 1725, he began the project of founding a college in [[Bermuda]] for training ministers and missionaries in the colony, in pursuit of which he gave up his deanery with its income of £1100.\u000a\u000a=== Marriage and America ===\u000aIn 1728, he married Anne Forster, daughter of [[John Forster (Chief Justice)|John Forster]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]]. He then went to America on a salary of £100 per annum. He landed near [[Newport, Rhode Island]], where he bought a plantation at [[Middletown, Rhode Island|Middletown]]{{spaced ndash}}the famous "[[Whitehall Museum House|Whitehall]]". It has been claimed that "he introduced [[Palladianism]] into America by borrowing a design from [William] Kent's ''Designs of Inigo Jones'' for the door-case of his house in Rhode Island [Whitehall]". He also brought to New England [[John Smybert|John Smibert]], the British artist he "discovered" in Italy, who is generally regarded as the founding father of American portrait painting.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Smibert|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Smibert|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, he drew up plans for the ideal city he planned to build on Bermuda.<ref>E. Chaney, "George Berkeley's Grand Tours",''Evolution of the Grand Tour'', p. 324</ref> He lived at the plantation while he waited for funds for his college to arrive. The funds, however, were not forthcoming, and in 1732 he left America and returned to London.\u000a\u000a=== Humanitarian work ===\u000aWhile living in London's Saville Street, he took part in efforts to create a home for the city's abandoned children. The [[Foundling Hospital]] was founded by [[Royal Charter]] in 1739, and Berkeley is listed as one of its original governors. In 1734, he was appointed [[Bishop of Cloyne]] in Ireland, a position he was to hold until his death. Soon afterwards, he published ''[[Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher]]'', directed against both [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Bernard de Mandeville]]; and in 1735\u201337 ''The Querist''.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |year=1750 |title=The Querist, Containing, Several Queries, Proposed to the Consideration of the Public by the Bishop of Cloyne |publisher= George Faulkner |place=Dublin|edition= Third with Additions |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/stream/ldpd_9168945_000#page/n1/mode/2up|accessdate=13 June 2016 |via= Internet Archive}}</ref>\u000a\u000a=== Last works ===\u000aHis last two publications were ''Siris: A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tarwater, And divers other Subjects connected together and arising one from another'' (1744) and ''Further Thoughts on Tar-water'' (1752). [[Pine tar]] is an effective antiseptic and disinfectant when applied to cuts on the skin, but Berkeley argued for the use of pine tar as a broad panacea for diseases. His 1744 work on tar-water sold more copies than any of his other books during Berkeley's lifetime.<ref name="SEP"/>\u000a\u000aHe remained at Cloyne until 1752, when he retired and went to Oxford to live with his son. He died soon afterward and was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]. His affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much loved and held in warm regard by many of his contemporaries.<ref>Pope, in his ''Satires, Epistles, and Odes of Horace'' (Epilogue to the Satires, Dialogue ii, line 73) refers to God granting "To Berkeley every Virtue under Heaven".</ref>\u000a\u000a== Contributions to philosophy ==\u000a{{Main|Subjective idealism}}\u000a\u000a{{Quotation|According to Berkeley there are only two kinds of things: spirits and ideas. Spirits are simple, active beings which produce and perceive ideas; ideas are passive beings which are produced and perceived.<ref>Bettcher T.M. ''Berkeley: A Guide for the Perplexed''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum Publishing]], 2008. p. 14.</ref> }}\u000a\u000aThe use of the concepts of "spirit" and "idea" is central in Berkeley's philosophy. As used by him, these concepts are difficult to translate into modern terminology. His concept of "spirit" is close to the concept of "conscious subject" or of "mind", and the concept of "idea" is close to the concept of "sensation" or "state of mind" or "conscious experience".\u000a\u000aThus Berkeley denied the existence of matter as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] substance, but did not deny the existence of physical objects such as apples or mountains. ("''I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection. That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance. And in doing of this, there is no damage done to the rest of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it.''", ''Principles ''#35) This basic claim of Berkeley's thought, his "idealism", is sometimes and somewhat derisively called "immaterialism" or, occasionally, [[subjective idealism]]. In ''Principles #3,'' he wrote, using a combination of Latin and English, ''esse is percipi'' (to be is to be perceived), most often if slightly inaccurately attributed to Berkeley as the pure Latin phrase ''esse est percipi.''<ref>Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''. [[Routledge]], 2001. p. 27.</ref> The phrase appears associated with him in authoritative philosophical sources, e.g., "Berkeley holds that there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous phrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) \u2013 to be is to be perceived (or to perceive)."<ref name="SEP">Downing, Lisa, "George Berkeley", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.) <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/berkeley/>. Retrieved 21 August 2013.</ref>\u000a\u000aHence, human knowledge is reduced to two elements: that of spirits and of ideas (''Principles'' #86). In contrast to ideas, a spirit cannot be perceived. A person's spirit, which perceives ideas, is to be comprehended intuitively by inward feeling or reflection (''Principles'' #89). For Berkeley, we have no direct 'idea' of spirits, albeit we have good reason to believe in the existence of other spirits, for their existence explains the purposeful regularities we find in experience.<ref>Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''. [[Routledge]], 2001. p. 74-75.</ref> ("''It is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations, or the ideas by them excited in us''", Dialogues #145). This is the solution that Berkeley offers to the [[problem of other minds]]. Finally, the order and purposefulness of the whole of our experience of the world and especially of nature overwhelms us into believing in the existence of an extremely powerful and intelligent spirit that causes that order. According to Berkeley, reflection on the attributes of that external spirit leads us to identify it with God. Thus a material thing such as an apple consists of a collection of ideas (shape, color, taste, physical properties, etc.) which are caused in the spirits of humans by the spirit of God.\u000a\u000a=== Theology ===\u000aA convinced adherent of Christianity, Berkeley believed God to be present as an immediate [[causality|cause]] of all our experiences.\u000a\u000a{{quote|He did not evade the question of the external source of the diversity of the [[sense data]] at the disposal of the human individual. He strove simply to show that the causes of sensations could not be things, because what we called things, and considered without grounds to be something different from our sensations, were built up wholly from sensations. There must consequently be some other external source of the inexhaustible diversity of sensations. The source of our sensations, Berkeley concluded, could only be God; He gave them to man, who had to see in them signs and symbols that carried God's word.<ref name="The Main Trends in Philosophy">[[Teodor Oizerman|Oizerman T.I.]] [https://archive.org/details/TheMainTrendsInPhilosophy The Main Trends in Philosophy]. A Theoretical Analysis of the History of Philosophy. Moscow, 1988, p. 78.</ref>}}\u000a\u000aHere is Berkeley's proof of the existence of God:\u000a\u000a{{quote|Whatever power I may have over my own thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that produces them. (Berkeley. ''Principles'' #29)}}\u000a\u000aAs T.I. Oizerman explained:\u000a\u000a{{quote|Berkeley's [[Subjective idealism|mystic idealism]] (as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] aptly christened it) claimed that nothing separated man and God (except [[materialism|materialist]] misconceptions, of course), since nature or matter did not exist as a reality independent of consciousness. The revelation of God was directly accessible to man, according to this doctrine; it was the sense-perceived world, the world of man's sensations, which came to him from on high for him to decipher and so grasp the divine purpose.<ref name="The Main Trends in Philosophy"/>}}\u000a\u000aBerkeley believed that God is not the distant engineer of [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] machinery that in the fullness of time led to the growth of a tree in the university quadrangle. Rather, the perception of the tree is an idea that God's mind has produced in the mind, and the tree continues to exist in the quadrangle when "nobody" is there, simply because God is an infinite [[mind]] that perceives all.\u000a\u000aThe philosophy of [[David Hume]] concerning causality and objectivity is an elaboration of another aspect of Berkeley's philosophy. [[A.A. Luce]], the most eminent Berkeley scholar of the 20th century, constantly stressed the continuity of Berkeley's philosophy. The fact that Berkeley returned to his major works throughout his life, issuing revised editions with only minor changes, also counts against any theory that attributes to him a significant [[volte-face]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\u000a\u000a=== Relativity arguments ===\u000a{{See also|Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous}}\u000aJohn Locke (Berkeley's predecessor) states that we define an object by its [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary and secondary qualities]]. He takes heat as an example of a secondary quality. If you put one hand in a bucket of cold water, and the other hand in a bucket of warm water, then put both hands in a bucket of lukewarm water, one of your hands is going to tell you that the water is cold and the other that the water is hot. Locke says that since two different objects (both your hands) perceive the water to be hot ''and'' cold, then the heat is not a quality of the water.\u000a\u000aWhile Locke used this argument to distinguish primary from secondary qualities, Berkeley extends it to cover primary qualities in the same way. For example, he says that size is not a quality of an object because the size of the object depends on the distance between the observer and the object, or the size of the observer. Since an object is a different size to different observers, then size is not a quality of the object. Berkeley rejects shape with a similar argument and then asks: if neither primary qualities nor secondary qualities are of the object, then how can we say that there is anything more than the qualities we observe?\u000a\u000a=== New theory of vision ===\u000aIn his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision'', Berkeley frequently criticised the views of the Optic Writers, a title that seems to include [[William Molyneux|Molyneux]], Wallis, [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>Schwartz, R, 1994. Vision: Variations on some Berkeleian themes. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 54.</ref> In sections 1\u201351, Berkeley argued against the classical scholars of optics by holding that: ''spatial depth, as the distance that separates the perceiver from the perceived object is itself invisible''; namely, that space is perceived by experience instead of the senses ''per se''.\u000a\u000aBerkeley goes on to argue that visual cues, such as the perceived extension or 'confusion' of an object, can only be used to indirectly judge distance, because the viewer learns to associate visual cues with tactile sensations. Berkeley gives the following analogy regarding indirect distance perception: one perceives distance indirectly just as one perceives a person's embarrassment indirectly. When looking at an embarrassed person, we infer indirectly that the person is embarrassed by observing the red color on the person's face. We know through experience that a red face tends to signal embarrassment, as we've learned to associate the two.\u000a\u000aThe question concerning the visibility of space was central to the Renaissance [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] tradition and its reliance on classical optics in the development of pictorial representations of spatial depth.  This matter was debated by scholars since the 11th-century Arab polymath and mathematician [[Alhazen]] (al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham) affirmed in experimental contexts the visibility of space.  This issue, which was raised in Berkeley's theory of vision, was treated at length in the ''Phenomenology of Perception'' of Maurice [[Merleau-Ponty]], in the context of confirming the visual perception of spatial depth (''la profondeur''), and by way of refuting Berkeley's thesis.<ref>For recent studies on this topic refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'La perception de la profondeur: [[Alhazen]], Berkeley et Merleau-Ponty', ''Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et médiévales'', [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] Vol. 5 (2004), pp. 171\u2013184.

He is frequently misquoted as believing in size-distance invariance \u2013 a view held by the Optic Writers. This idea is that we scale the image size according to distance in a geometrical manner. The error may have become commonplace because the eminent historian and psychologist E. G. Boring perpetuated it.<ref>Boring E. G., 1942. Sensation and perception in the history of experimental psychology. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, pp.223 and 298.</ref> In fact, Berkeley argued that the same cues that evoke distance also evoke size, and that we do not first see size and then calculate distance.<ref>Ross H.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 499\u2013528.</ref> It is worth quoting Berkeley's words on this issue (Section 53):\u000a\u000a<blockquote>What inclines men to this mistake (beside the humour of making one see by geometry) is, that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance, do also suggest magnitude... I say they do not first suggest distance, and then leave it to the judgement to use that as a medium, whereby to collect the magnitude; but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance; and suggest magnitude as independently of distance, as they do distance independently of magnitude.</blockquote>\u000a\u000a=== Philosophy of physics ===\u000a{{See also|De Motu (Berkeley's essay)}}\u000a"Berkeley's works display his keen interest in natural philosophy [...] from his earliest writings (''Arithmetica'', 1707) to his latest (''Siris'', 1744).

(#316)\u000a\u000aBerkeley argued that forces and gravity, as defined by Newton, constituted "occult qualities" that "expressed nothing distinctly". He held that those who posited "something unknown in a body of which they have no idea and which they call the principle of motion, are in fact simply stating that the principle of motion is unknown." Therefore, those who "affirm that active force, action, and the principle of motion are really in bodies are adopting an opinion not based on experience."<ref>De Motu, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E.

On the other hand, if they resided in the category of "soul" or "incorporeal thing", they "do not properly belong to physics" as a matter.

[[Florian Cajori]] called this treatise "the most spectacular event of the century in the history of British mathematics."<ref>{{Cite book|author= [[Florian Cajori]] |title= A History of the Conceptions of Limits and Fluxions in Great Britain, from Newton to Woodhouse  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3YAVRAAACAAJ&dq=cajori+%22history+of+the+conceptions+of+limits%22 |publisher= BiblioBazaar |location= |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-143-05698-7}}</ref> However, a recent study suggests that Berkeley misunderstood Leibnizian calculus.<ref>{{citation\u000a | last1 = Katz | first1 = Mikhail\u000a | author1-link = Mikhail Katz\u000a | last2 = Sherry | first2 = David\u000a | author2-link = David Sherry\u000a | arxiv = 1205.0174\u000a | doi = 10.1007/s10670-012-9370-y\u000a | issue =\u000a | journal = [[Erkenntnis]]\u000a | pages =\u000a | title = Leibniz's Infinitesimals: Their Fictionality, Their Modern Implementations, and Their Foes from Berkeley to Russell and Beyond\u000a | volume =\u000a | year = 2012}}</ref> The mathematician in question is believed to have been either [[Edmond Halley]], or [[Isaac Newton]] himself\u2014though if to the latter, then the discourse was posthumously addressed, as Newton died in 1727. ''The Analyst'' represented a direct attack on the foundations and principles of [[calculus]] and, in particular, the notion of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxion]] or [[infinitesimal]] change, which Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] used to develop the calculus.  Berkeley coined the phrase [[ghosts of departed quantities]], familiar to students of calculus. [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]'s book [[From Here to Infinity (book)|From Here to Infinity]], (chapter 6), captures the gist of his criticism.\u000a\u000aBerkeley regarded his criticism of calculus as part of his broader campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics{{spaced ndash}}as a defence of traditional Christianity against [[deism]], which tends to distance God from His worshipers. Specifically, he observed that both Newtonian and Leibnizian calculus employed infinitesimals sometimes as positive, nonzero quantities and other times as a number explicitly equal to zero. Berkeley's key point in "The Analyst" was that Newton's calculus (and the laws of motion based in calculus) lacked rigorous theoretical foundations. He claimed that\u000a<blockquote>\u000aIn every other Science Men prove their Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by the Conclusions. But if in yours you should allow your selves this unnatural way of proceeding, the Consequence would be that you must take up with Induction, and bid adieu to Demonstration. And if you submit to this, your Authority will no longer lead the way in Points of Reason and Science.<ref>The Analyst, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E.

Berkeley, however, found it paradoxical that "Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from false Principles, be right in Conclusion, and yet err in the Premises." In "The Analyst" he endeavoured to show "how Error may bring forth Truth, though it cannot bring forth Science."<ref>The Analyst, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E.

Print.</ref> and that people can obey different supreme authorities if there are more than one claims to the highest authority.\u000a\u000aBerkeley defends this thesis with a deductive proof stemming from the laws of nature. First, he establishes that because God is perfectly good, the end to which he commands humans must also be good, and that end must not benefit just one person, but the entire human race. Because these commands\u2014or \u2018laws\u2014if practiced, would lead to the general fitness of humankind, it follows that they can be discovered by the right reason\u2014for example, the law to never resist supreme power can be derived from reason because this law is \u201cthe only thing that stands between us and total disorder\u201d.<ref name=":0" /> Thus, these laws can be called the laws of nature, because they are derived from God\u2014the creator of nature himself. \u201cThese laws of nature include duties never to resist the supreme power, lie under oath\u2026or do evil so that good may come of it.\u201d<ref name=":0" />\u000a\u000aOne may view Berkeley\u2019s doctrine on Passive Obedience as a kind of \u2018Theological Utilitarianism\u2019, insofar as it states that we have a duty to uphold a moral code which presumably is working towards the ends of promoting the good of humankind. However, the concept of \u2018ordinary\u2019 Utilitarianism is fundamentally different in that it \u201cmakes utility the one and only ''ground'' of obligation\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/broad/berkeley.html|title=Berkeley's Theory of Morals|website=www.ditext.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}</ref>\u2014that is, Utilitarianism is concerned with whether particular actions are morally permissible in specific situations, while Berkeley\u2019s doctrine is concerned with whether or not we should follow moral rules in any and all circumstances. Whereas Utilitarianism might, for example, justify a morally impermissible act in light of the specific situation, Berkeley\u2019s doctrine of Passive Obedience holds that it is never morally permissible to not follow a moral rule, even when it seems like breaking that moral rule might achieve the happiest ends. Berkeley holds that even though sometimes, the consequences of an action in a specific situation might be bad, the general tendencies of that action benefits humanity.\u000a\u000aOther important sources for Berkeley's views on morality are ''[[Alciphron (book)|Alciphron]]'' (1732), especially dialogues I\u2013III, and the ''Discourse to Magistrates'' (1738)."<ref>Jakapi, Roomet.
