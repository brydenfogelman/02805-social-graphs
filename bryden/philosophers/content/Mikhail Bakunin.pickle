He is considered among the most influential figures of [[anarchism]], and one of the principal founders of the [[Social anarchism|social anarchist]] tradition.<ref>{{citation|last=Masters |first=Anthony|authorlink=|year=1974|title=Bakunin, the Father of Anarchism|publisher=Saturday Review Press|location=|isbn=0-8415-0295-1}}</ref> Bakunin's enormous prestige as an activist made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, and he gained substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\u000a\u000aBakunin grew up in [[Kuvshinovsky District|Pryamukhino]], a family estate in [[Tver Governorate]], where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French [[encyclopédistes]], leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his embrace of [[Hegelianism]], bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim, "Everything that exists is rational." In 1840, Bakunin traveled to [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin with the intention of preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the [[University of Moscow]]. In 1842, Bakunin moved from Berlin to Dresden. Eventually he arrived in Paris, where he met [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx]].\u000a\u000aBakunin's increasing radicalism \u2013 including staunch opposition to imperialism in east and central Europe by Russia and other powers \u2013 changed his life, putting an end to hopes of a professorial career. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of Poland. In 1849, Bakunin was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848|Czech rebellion of 1848]], and turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress|Peter-Paul Fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. He remained there until 1857, when he was exiled to a work camp in Siberia. Escaping to Japan, the US and finally ending up in London for a short time, he worked with [[Alexander Herzen]] on the journal ''Kolokol'' (''The Bell''). In 1863, he left to join the [[January Uprising|insurrection in Poland]], but he failed to reach his destination and instead spent some time in Switzerland and Italy.\u000a\u000aIn 1868, Bakunin joined the socialist [[International Working Men's Association]], a federation of trade unions and workers' organizations, which had sections in many European countries, as well as in Latin America and (after 1872) in North Africa and the Middle East. The "Bakuninist" or anarcho-socialist trend rapidly expanded in influence, especially in Spain, which constituted the largest section of the International at the time. A showdown loomed with Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International. The 1872 [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers, who argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism, and the Bakunin/anarchist faction, which argued instead for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes. Bakunin could not attend the congress, as he could not reach the Netherlands. Bakunin's faction present at the conference lost, and Bakunin was (in Marx's view) expelled for supposedly maintaining a secret organisation within the international.\u000a\u000aHowever, the anarchists insisted the congress was unrepresentative and exceeded its powers, and held a rival conference of the International at [[Saint-Imier]] in Switzerland in 1872. This repudiated the Hague meeting, including Bakunin's supposed expulsion. The great majority of sections of the International affiliated to the St. Imier body, making Marx's victory rather more illusory than pro-Marxist accounts suggest. The far larger Bakuninist international outlasted its small Marxist rival, which was isolated in New York; it also greatly facilitated the global spread of anarcho-socialism. In the International, as well as in his writings, Bakunin articulated the basic ideas of [[syndicalism]] and of [[anarchism]], and developed the basic anarchist analysis and strategy. He had by this stage abandoned the anti-imperialist nationalism of his youth.\u000a\u000aFrom 1870 to 1876, Bakunin wrote some of his longer works, such as ''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'' and ''[[God and the State]]''. Bakunin remained, however, a direct participant in struggles. In 1870, he was involved in an insurrection in [[Lyon]], France, which foreshadowed the [[Paris Commune]]. The Paris Commune closely corresponded to many elements of Bakunin's anarchist programme \u2013 self-management, mandates delegates, a militia system with elected officers, and decentralisation. Anarchists like [[Élisée Reclus]], and those in the tradition of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] \u2013 who had greatly influenced Bakunin \u2013 were key figures in the Commune. Despite declining health, much a result of his years of imprisonment, Bakunin also sought to take part in a communal insurrection involving anarchists in [[Bologna]], Italy, but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, where he settled in [[Lugano]]. He remained active in the worker's and peasant's movements of Europe and was also a major influence on movements in Egypt and Latin America.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000a\u000a===Early years===\u000aIn the spring of 1814, Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin "was born to a noble family of only modest means"<ref name=Sale>[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (2006-11-06) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2006/nov/06/00031/ An Enemy of the State], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> \u2013 the family owned 500 serfs<ref>{{Citation|last=Bakunin|first=Michael|title=Statism and Anarchy|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffXU01KzRNQC|editor=Marshall Shatz|format=Translation into English with introduction by the editor|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-0-521-36973-2}}</ref> \u2013 in the village of [[:ru:\u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u0443\u0445\u0438\u043d\u043e|Pryamukhino]] (\u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u0443\u0445\u0438\u043d\u043e), between [[Torzhok]] and [[Kuvshinovo]], in [[Tver Governorate]], northwest of Moscow. His father was a career diplomat who, as a young attache, had lived for years in [[Florence]] and [[Naples]]. Upon his return to Russia, his father settled down on his paternal estate where at the age of forty, he married an eighteen-year-old girl from the prominent Muravyov family. His father's commitment to liberal ideas led to his involvement with one of the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist]] clubs. After [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas I]] became Tsar, however, Bakunin senior gave up politics and devoted himself to the care of his estate and the education of his children, five girls and five boys, the oldest of whom was Mikhail (Michael).<ref>{{cite book|last=Leier|first=Mark|year=2006|pp=19|title=[[Bakunin: The Creative Passion]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-58322-894-4|ref=harv}}</ref>\u000a\u000aAt the age of 14 Michael left for [[Saint Petersburg]], receiving military training at the Artillery University, "a rigid, anti-Western military school, where he chafed at the arbitrary discipline and the narrow curriculum\u2014much less encompassing than the homeschooling he had experienced before."<ref name=Sale/> He was "expelled from school in 1834 for poor grades and assigned to barracks on the Polish frontier."<ref name=Sale/> He was commissioned a junior officer in the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Russian Imperial Guard]] and sent to [[Minsk]] and [[Grodno|Gardinas]] in Lithuania (now [[Belarus]]). After two years he left the Imperial Guard, as he could not agree on how the [[Poles|Polish people]] were treated by the Russian authorities. Since that time, the fate of the Polish national liberation struggle became Bakunin's constant interest. Though his father wished him to continue in either the military or the civil service, Bakunin abandoned both in 1835, and made his way to Moscow, hoping to study philosophy.\u000a\u000a===Interest in philosophy===\u000aIn Moscow, Bakunin soon became friends with a group of former university students, and engaged in the systematic study of [[Idealist]] philosophy, grouped around the poet [[Nikolay Stankevich]], "the bold pioneer who opened to Russian thought the vast and fertile continent of German metaphysics" ([[E. H. Carr]]). The philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] initially was central to their study, but they progressed to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], Fichte, and Hegel. By autumn 1835, Bakunin had conceived of forming a philosophical circle in his home town of Pryamukhino. Moreover, by early 1836, Bakunin was back in Moscow, where he published translations of Fichte's ''Some Lectures Concerning the Scholar's Vocation'' and ''The Way to a Blessed Life'', which became his favorite book. With Stankevich he also read [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]].\u000a\u000aHe became increasingly influenced by Hegel and provided the first Russian translation of his work. During this period he met [[slavophile]] [[Konstantin Aksakov]], [[Pyotr Chaadayev|Piotr Tschaadaev]] and the [[socialism|socialists]] [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Nikolay Ogarev]]. In this period he began to develop his [[pan-slavism|panslavic]] views.  After long wrangles with his father, Bakunin went to Berlin in 1840.  His stated plan at the time was still to become a university professor (a \u201cpriest of truth,\u201d as he and his friends imagined it), but he soon encountered and joined students of the [[Young Hegelians]] and the socialist movement in Berlin. In his 1842 essay "The Reaction in Germany", he argued in favor of the revolutionary role of negation, summed up in the phrase "the passion for destruction is a creative passion."<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail (1842). "[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1842/reaction-germany.htm The Reaction in Germany]". In: [[Sam Dolgoff]] (1971, 1980), ''Bakunin on Anarchy''.</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter three semesters in Berlin, Bakunin went to [[Dresden]] where he became friends with [[Arnold Ruge]]. Here he also read [[Lorenz von Stein]]'s ''Der Sozialismus und Kommunismus des heutigen Frankreich'' and developed a passion for socialism. He abandoned his interest in an academic career, devoting more and more of his time to promoting revolution. The Russian government, becoming aware of this activity, ordered him to return to Russia. On his refusal his property was confiscated. Instead he went with [[Georg Herwegh]] to Zürich, Switzerland.\u000a\u000a===Switzerland, Brussels, Prague, Dresden and Paris===\u000a[[File:Young Bakunin.jpg|thumb|The young Mikhail Bakunin, illustrated in 1843]]\u000aDuring his six-month stay in Zürich, he became closely associated with German [[communist]] [[Wilhelm Weitling]].\u000aUntil 1848 he remained on friendly terms with the German communists, occasionally calling himself a communist and writing articles on communism in the ''Schweitzerische Republikaner''. He moved to Geneva in western Switzerland shortly before Weitling's arrest. His name had appeared frequently in Weitling's correspondence seized by the police. This led to reports being circulated to the imperial police. The Russian ambassador in Bern ordered Bakunin to return to Russia, but instead he went to [[Brussels]], where he met many leading Polish nationalists, such as [[Joachim Lelewel]], co-member with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] at Brussels. Lelewel greatly influenced him; however, he clashed with the Polish nationalists over their demand for a historic Poland based on the borders of 1776 (before the [[Partitions of Poland]]) as he defended the right of autonomy for the non-Polish peoples in these territories. He also did not support their [[clericalism]] and they did not support his calls for the emancipation of the [[peasantry]].\u000a\u000aIn 1844 Bakunin went to Paris, then a centre of the European political current. He established contact with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who greatly impressed him and with whom he formed a personal bond.  In December 1844, Emperor Nicholas issued a decree that stripped Bakunin of his privileges as a [[nobility|noble]], confiscated his land in Russia, and condemned him to lifelong exile in Siberia. He responded with a long letter to ''La Réforme'', denouncing the Emperor as a despot and calling for democracy in Russia and Poland (Carr, p.&nbsp;139). In March 1846 in another letter to the ''Constitutionel'' he defended Poland, following the repression of [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] there. Some Polish refugees from [[Kraków]], following the defeat of the [[Kraków Uprising|uprising]] there, invited him to speak<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1847/poland-speech.htm On the 17th Anniversary of the Polish Insurrection of 1830], Mikhail Bakunin, La Réforme, December 14, 1847</ref> at the meeting in November 1847 commemorating the Polish [[November Uprising]] of 1830.\u000a\u000aIn his speech, Bakunin called for an alliance between the Polish and Russian peoples against the Emperor, and looked forward to "the definitive collapse of despotism in Russia." As a result, he was expelled from France and went to Brussels.  Bakunin's attempt to draw [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Vissarion Belinsky]] into conspiratorial action for revolution in Russia fell on deaf ears. In Brussels, Bakunin renewed his contacts with revolutionary Poles and Karl Marx. He spoke at a meeting organised by Lelewel in February 1848 about a great future for the Slavs, whose destiny was to rejuvenate the Western world. Around this time the Russian embassy circulated rumours that Bakunin was a Russian agent who had exceeded his orders.\u000a\u000aAs the [[revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movement of 1848]] broke out, Bakunin was ecstatic, despite disappointment that little was happening in Russia. Bakunin obtained funding from some socialists in the Provisional Government, [[Ferdinand Flocon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin]] and [[Alexandre Martin]], for a project for a Slav federation liberating those under the rule of Prussia, [[Austro-Hungary]] and Ottoman Empire. He left for Germany travelling through [[Baden]] to [[Frankfurt]] and [[Köln]].\u000a\u000aBakunin supported the [[German Democratic Legion]] led by Herwegh in an abortive attempt to join [[Friedrich Hecker]]'s insurrection in [[Baden]]. He broke with Marx over the latter's criticism of Herwegh. Much later in 1871 Bakunin was to write: <blockquote>"I must openly admit that in this controversy Marx and Engels were in the right. With characteristic insolence, they attacked Herwegh personally when he was not there to defend himself. In a face-to-face confrontation with them, I heatedly defended Herwegh, and our mutual dislike began then."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm Michael Bakunin A Biographical Sketch] by [[James Guillaume]]</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aBakunin went on to Berlin but was stopped by the police from traveling to [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]], part of Polish territories gained by Prussia in the [[Partitions of Poland]], where a nationalist [[Wielkopolska Uprising (1848)|insurrection]] was taking place. Instead Bakunin went to [[Leipzig]] and [[Breslau]] and then on to [[Prague]] where he participated in the First Pan Slav Congress. The Congress was followed by an [[May Conspiracy|abortive insurrection]] that Bakunin had sought to promote and intensify but which was violently suppressed.\u000a\u000a[[Richard Wagner]] writes in his autobiography about Bakunin's visit:<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/wglf110.txt |title=My Life \u2014 Volume 1 |author=Richard Wagner |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>\u000a\u000a{{quote|First of all, however, with the view of adapting himself to the most Philistine culture, he had to submit his huge beard and bushy hair to the tender mercies of the razor and shears. As no barber was available, Rockel had to undertake the task. A small group of friends watched the operation, which had to be executed with a dull razor, causing no little pain, under which none but the victim himself remained passive. We bade farewell to Bakunin with the firm conviction that we should never see him again alive. But in a week he was back once more, as he had realised immediately what a distorted account he had received as to the state of things in Prague, where all he found ready for him was a mere handful of childish students. These admissions made him the butt of Rockel's good-humoured chaff, and after this he won the reputation among us of being a mere revolutionary, who was content with theoretical conspiracy. Very similar to his expectations from the Prague students were his presumptions with regard to the Russian people. }}\u000a\u000aHe returned to Breslau, where Marx republished the allegation that Bakunin was an imperial agent, claiming that [[George Sand]] had proof. Marx retracted the statement after George Sand came to Bakunin's defense{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}.\u000a\u000aBakunin published his ''Appeal to the Slavs''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1848/pan-slavism.htm Appeal to the Slavs], Mikhail Bakunin, 1848, ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.</ref> in the fall of 1848, in which he proposed that Slav revolutionaries unite with Hungarian, Italian and German revolutionaries to overthrow the three major European autocracies, the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia.\u000a\u000aBakunin played a leading role in the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] in 1849, helping to organize the defense of the barricades against Prussian troops with [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Wilhelm Heine]]. Bakunin was captured in [[Chemnitz]] and held for thirteen months before being condemned to death by the government of [[Saxony]]. His sentence was commuted to life to allow his extradition to Russia and Austria both of whom were seeking to prosecute him. In June 1850, he was handed over to the Austrian authorities. Eleven months later he received a further death sentence but this too was commuted to life imprisonment. Finally, in May 1851, Bakunin was handed over to the Russian authorities.\u000a\u000a===Imprisonment, "confession", and exile===\u000aBakunin was taken to the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. At the beginning of his captivity, Count [[Orlov (family)|Orlov]], an emissary of the Tsar, visited Bakunin and told him that the Tsar requested a written confession<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1851/confession.htm Confession to Tsar Nicholas I], Mikhail Bakunin, 1851</ref> hoping that the confession would place Bakunin spiritually as well as physically in the power of the Russian state. Since all his acts were known, he had no secrets to reveal, and so he decided to write to the Tsar, "You want my confession; but you must know that a penitent sinner is not obliged to implicate or reveal the misdeeds of others. I have only the honor and the conscience that I have never betrayed anyone who has confided in me, and this is why I will not give you any names."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\u000a\u000aAfter three years in the underground dungeons of the Fortress of St Peter and St Paul, he spent another four years in the castle of [[Shlisselburg]]. It was here that he suffered from [[scurvy]] and all his teeth fell out as a result of the diet. He later recounted that he found some relief in mentally re-enacting the legend of [[Prometheus]]. His continuing imprisonment in these awful conditions led him to entreat his brother to supply him with poison.\u000a[[File:Mikhail Bakunin and Antonia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mikhail Bakunin and Antonia Kwiatkowska, circa 1861]]\u000a\u000aFollowing the death of Nicholas I, the new Tsar, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] personally struck Bakunin's name off the amnesty list. In February 1857 his mother's pleas to the Tsar were finally heeded and he was allowed to go into permanent exile in the western Siberian city of [[Tomsk]]. Within a year of arriving in Tomsk, Bakunin married Antonia Kwiatkowska, the daughter of a Polish merchant. He had been teaching her French. In August 1858 Bakunin received a visit from his second cousin, General Count [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]], who had been governor of Eastern Siberia for ten years.\u000a\u000aMuravyov was a liberal and Bakunin, as his relative, became a particular favourite. In the spring of 1859 Muravyov helped Bakunin with a job for Amur Development Agency which enabled him to move with his wife to [[Irkutsk]], the capital of [[Eastern Siberia]]. This enabled Bakunin to be part of the circle involved in political discussions centred on Muravyov's colonial headquarters. Resenting the treatment of the colony by the Saint Petersburg bureaucracy, including its use as a dumping ground for malcontents, a proposal for a ''United States of Siberia'' emerged, independent of Russia and federated into a new ''United States of Siberia and America'', following the example of the United States of America. The circle included Muravyov's young Chief of Staff, Kukel&nbsp;\u2013 who [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] related had the complete works of [[Alexander Herzen]]&nbsp;\u2013 the civil governor Izvolsky<!--NOT Alexander Izvolsky-->, who allowed Bakunin to use his address for correspondence, and Muravyov's deputy and eventual successor, General [[Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov]].\u000a\u000aWhen Herzen criticised Muravyov in  ''The Bell'', Bakunin wrote vigorously in his patron's defence.<ref>[http://alternative-anar.ifrance.com/asie/04.pdf ''Bakunin, Yokohama and the Dawning of the Pacific''] by Peter Billingsley</ref>  Bakunin tired of his job as a commercial traveller, but thanks to Muravyov's influence, was able to keep his sinecure (worth 2,000 roubles a year) without having to perform any duties. Muravyov was forced to retire from his post as governor general, partly because of his liberal views and partly due to fears he might take Siberia towards independence. He was replaced by Korsakov, who perhaps was even more sympathetic to the plight of the Siberian exiles. Korsakov was also related to Bakunin, Bakunin's brother Paul having married his cousin. Taking Bakunin's word, Korsakov issued him with a letter giving him passage on all ships on the [[Amur River]] and its tributaries as long as he was back in Irkutsk when the ice came.\u000a\u000a===Escape from exile and return to Europe===\u000aOn 5 June 1861 Bakunin left [[Irkutsk]] under cover of company business, ostensibly employed by a Siberian merchant to make a trip to [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur|Nikolaevsk]]. By 17 July he was on board the Russian warship ''Strelok'' bound for Kastri. However, in the port of [[Olga, Russia|Olga]], Bakunin managed to persuade the American captain of the SS ''Vickery'' to take him on board. Despite bumping into the Russian Consul on board, Bakunin was able to sail away under the nose of the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. By 6 August he had reached [[Hakodate]] in the northernmost Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and was soon in [[Yokohama]].\u000a\u000aIn Japan Bakunin met by chance [[Wilhelm Heine]], one of his comrades-in arms from Dresden. He also met the German botanist [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] who had been involved in opening up Japan to Europeans (particularly Russians and the Dutch) and was a friend of Bakunin's patron Muraviev.<ref>Edgar Franz, ''Philipp Franz von Siebold and Russian Policy and Action on Opening Japan to the West in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century'', Munich: Iudicum 2005</ref> Von Siebold's son wrote some 40 years later:\u000a\u000a{{quote|In that Yokohama boarding-house we encountered an outlaw from the Wild West Heine, presumably as well as many other interesting guests.

Garibaldi was then engaged in preparations for the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Expedition against Rome|Expedition against Rome]]. By May Bakunin's correspondence was focussing on Italian-Slavic unity and the developments in Poland. By June he had resolved to move to Italy, but was waiting for his wife to join him. When he left for Italy in August, [[Mazzini]] wrote to Maurizio Quadrio, one of his key supporters that Bakunin was a good and dependable person. However, with the news of the failure at [[Battle of Aspromonte|Aspromonte]] Bakunin paused in Paris where he was briefly involved with [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. However Bakunin rejected Mieroslawski's chauvinism and refusal to grant any concessions to the peasants.\u000a\u000aBakunin returned to England in September and focussed on Polish affairs. When the [[January Uprising|Polish insurrection]] broke out in January 1863, he sailed to Copenhagen where he hoped to join the Polish insurgents. They planned to sail across the Baltic in the SS ''Ward Jackson'' to join the insurrection. This attempt failed, and Bakunin met his wife in Stockholm before returning to London. Now he focussed again on going to Italy and his friend Aurelio Saffi wrote him letters of introduction for [[Florence]], [[Turin]] and [[Milan]]. Mazzini wrote letters of commendation to [[Federico Campanella]] in [[Genoa]] and [[Giuseppe Dolfi]] in Florence. Bakunin left London in November 1863 travelling by way of Brussels, Paris and [[Vevey]] (Switzerland) arriving in Italy on 11 January 1864. It was here that he first began to develop his anarchist ideas.\u000a\u000aHe conceived the plan of forming a secret organization of revolutionaries to carry on propaganda work and prepare for direct action. He recruited Italians, Frenchmen, Scandinavians, and Slavs into the International Brotherhood, also called the Alliance of Revolutionary Socialists.\u000a\u000aBy July 1866 Bakunin was informing Herzen and Ogarev about the fruits of his work over the previous two years. His secret society then had members in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, England, France, Spain, and Italy, as well as Polish and Russian members. In his ''[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]]'' of 1866, he opposed religion and the state, advocating the "absolute rejection of every authority including that which sacrifices freedom for the convenience of the state."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm Revolutionary Catechism], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866, ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.</ref>\u000a[[File:Bakunin Membership Card.jpg|thumb|right|Bakunin's membership card of the ''League of Peace and Freedom'']]\u000a\u000a[[Giuseppe Fanelli]] met Bakunin at [[Ischia]] in 1866.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} In October 1868 Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to [[Barcelona]] to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the [[International Workingmen's Association]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=12\u201315}} Fanellis trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish exiles]], the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with [[Elisée Reclus]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Reclus and Fanelli were at odds over Reclus' friendships with Spanish republicans, and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}}<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5t0R0ckDMAC&pg=PA213]</ref> Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], to the First International.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=13}} In February 1869 Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} While in Barcelona again, he met with painter [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] and his cousin, [[Rafael Farga i Pellicer|Rafael Farga Pellicer]] along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona,{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} as well as the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance]] section.\u000a\u000aDuring the 1867\u20131868 period, Bakunin responded to [[Émile Acollas]]'s call and became involved in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), for which he wrote a lengthy essay ''Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism], Mikhail Bakunin, September 1867.</ref> Here he advocated a federalist socialism, drawing on the work of Proudhon.

Bakunin was instrumental in establishing branches of the International in Italy and Spain.\u000a\u000aIn 1869, the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Social Democratic Alliance]] was refused entry to the First International, on the grounds that it was an international organisation in itself, and only national organisations were permitted membership in the International. The Alliance dissolved and the various groups which it comprised joined the International separately.\u000a\u000aBetween 1869 and 1870, Bakunin became involved with the Russian revolutionary [[Sergey Nechayev]] in a number of clandestine projects. However, Bakunin broke with Nechaev over what he described as the latter's "[[Jesuit]]" methods, by which all means were justified to achieve revolutionary ends.<ref>[http://struggle.ws/anarchists/bakunin/writings/nechayev_secret_disagree.html Bakunin to Nechayev on the role of secret revolutionary societies], Mikhail Bakunin, 2 June 1870 letter to [[Sergey Nechayev]]</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1870 Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces, and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action:\u000a\u000a{{quote|we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.<ref name="marxists.org">[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870</ref>}}\u000a\u000aThese ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; Marxists were almost entirely absent from the Commune.

Another factor in the survival of religion is the existence of poverty, suffering and exploitation in real life, from which religion promises the salvation in the afterlife. Oppressors take advantage from religion, according to Bakunin, because many religious people reconcile themselves with injustice on earth by the promise of happiness in heaven.<ref name="God and the State"/>\u000a\u000aBakunin argues that oppressors receive authority from religion. Religious people are in many cases obedient to the [[priest]]s, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct [[divine revelation]] or [[scripture]]. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the [[omniscient]], [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God decides what is good or wrong. People who disobey the \u201cmessengers of God\u201d are threatened with punishment in hell.<ref name="God and the State"/>\u000a\u000aAccording to Bakunin, the alternative for a religious power monopoly is the acknowledgement that all humans are equally inspired by God, but that means that multiple contradictory teachings are assigned to an infallible God, which is logically impossible. Therefore, Bakunin considers religion as necessarily authoritarian.<ref name="God and the State"/>\u000a\u000aBakunin argued in his book ''[[God and the State]]'' that "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." Consequently, Bakunin reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him."<ref name="God and the State"/>\u000a\u000aBakunin was an early proponent of the term "[[political theology]]" in his 1871 text "The Political Theology of Mazzini and the International"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter |title=[[Demanding the Impossible]]|year=1992|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0002178559|pages=300\u20131}}</ref> to which [[Carl Schmitt#Political Theology|Schmitt's book]] was a response.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maier|first=Henrich|title=Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: The hidden dialogue|year=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226518884|pages=75\u20136}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|title=Political theology|year=1922|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226738892|pages=64\u201366}}</ref> Political theology is a branch of both [[political philosophy]] and theology that investigates the ways in which theological concepts or ways of thinking underlie political, social, economic and cultural discourses.\u000a\u000a===Class struggle strategy for social revolution===\u000aBakunin\u2019s methods of realizing his revolutionary program were consistent with his principles.

And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls\u2014or, if you will, rises\u2014to the position of a machine."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>\u000a\u000a===Federalism===\u000aBy [[federalism]], Bakunin meant the organization of society "from the base to the summit\u2014from the circumference to the center\u2014according to the principles of [[Freedom of association|free association]] and [[federation]]."<ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"/> Consequently, society would be organized "on the basis of the absolute freedom of individuals, of the productive associations, and of the communes," with "every individual, every association, every commune, every region, every nation" having "the absolute right to self-determination, to associate or not to associate, to ally themselves with whomever they wish."<ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"/>\u000a\u000a===Liberty===\u000aBy "liberty", Bakunin did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a [[Positive liberty|positive]] sense, liberty consists of "the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being, by education, by scientific training, and by material prosperity." Such a conception of liberty is "eminently social, because it can only be realized in society," not in isolation. In a [[Negative liberty|negative]] sense, liberty is "the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/man-society.htm Man, Society, and Freedom], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871</ref>\u000a\u000a===Materialism===\u000aBakunin denied religious concepts of a supernatural sphere, and advocated a '[[Materialism|materialist]]' explanation of natural phenomena: "the manifestations of organic life, chemical properties and reactions, electricity, light, warmth and the natural attraction of physical bodies, constitute in our view so many different but no less closely interdependent variants of that totality of real beings which we call matter" (''Selected Writings'', page 219). The "mission of science is, by observation of the general relations of passing and real facts, to establish the general laws inherent in the development of the phenomena of the physical and social world."\u000a\u000aHowever, his materialism was different to that of Marx, in that it stressed the importance of non-economic factors in human affairs, including ideas and cultures.\u000a\u000a===The revolutionary potential of the proletariat vs the ''lumpenproletariat'' and the peasantry===\u000aBakunin had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the ''[[lumpenproletariat]]'' and the [[proletariat]]. As such "Both agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion.<ref>[http://www.workerscompass.org/marxbakunin2_robertson.html "Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict \u2013 Part Two" by Ann Robertson.]</ref> Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form\u2014the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat."<ref>[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics'']</ref>\u000a\u000a==Influence==\u000aBakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism and as an opponent of Marxism, especially of Marx's idea of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], and for his predictions that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships over the proletariat, not of the proletariat itself. ''[[God and the State]]'' was translated multiple times by other anarchists, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Marie Le Compte]], and [[Emma Goldman]], and he continues to be an influence on modern-day anarchists, such as [[Noam Chomsky]].<ref>Chomsky, Noam (1970). ''For Reasons of State''. New York: Pantheon Books. (See especially title page and "Notes on Anarchism".)</ref> Bakunin biographer [[Mark Leier]] has asserted that "Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Enrico Malatesta]] to the [[Wobblies]] and Spanish anarchists in the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] to [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[E.P. Thompson]], [[Neil Postman]], and [[A.S. Neill]], down to the anarchists gathered these days under the banner of 'anti-[[globalization]].'"<ref name=Sale/> In short, Bakunin has had a major influence on labour, peasant and leftwing movements, although this was overshadowed from the 1920s by the rise of Marxist regimes. With the collapse of those regimes \u2013 and growing awareness of how closely those regimes corresponded to the dictatorships Bakunin predicted \u2013 Bakunin's ideas have rapidly gained ground amongst activists, in some cases again overshadowing Marxism.\u000a\u000a==Criticism==\u000a\u000a===Violence, revolution, and "Invisible dictatorship"===\u000a{{Main article|Invisible dictatorship}}\u000a\u000aBakunin has been accused of being a closet authoritarian by Marxists, Leninists, and other authoritarian Leftists.<ref>McLaughlin, P ''Anarchism and authority: a philosophical introduction to classical anarchism'', page 19, Ashgate Publishing, 2007, says that David Morland makes such a claim in Morland, D ''Demanding the Impossible? Human Nature and Politics in Nineteenth Century Anarchism'', p.78, London, 1997. Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian?, Struggle.ws, http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html, retrieved 2010-9-11 states that the accusation that Bakunin was a secret authoritarian is raised by "Leninists and other Marxists."</ref> In his letter to Albert Richard, he wrote that {{quote|[t]here is only one power and one dictatorship whose organisation is salutary and feasible: it is that collective, invisible dictatorship of those who are allied in the name of our principle.}}\u000aCharles A. Madison claimed that: {{quote|He [Bakunin] rejected political action as a means of abolishing the state and developed the doctrine of revolutionary conspiracy under autocratic leadership\u2013 disregarding the conflict of this principle with his philosophy of anarchism.}} Madison contended that it was Bakunin's scheming for control of the First International that brought about his rivalry with Karl Marx and his expulsion from it in 1872.  His approval of violence as a weapon against the agents of oppression led to nihilism in Russia and to individual acts of terrorism elsewhere\u2013 with the result that anarchism became generally synonymous with assassination and chaos.<ref name="Madison">{{Citation|author=Madison, Charles A.|year=1945|title=Anarchism in the United States|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=6|issue=1|pages=46\u201366 |doi=10.2307/2707055|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|jstor=2707055}}</ref> However, Bakunin's supporters argue that this "invisible dictatorship" is not a dictatorship in any conventional sense of the word, as Bakunin was careful to point out that its members would not exercise any official political power in the sense of a Leninist vanguard. Their influence would be ideological, and freely accepted: {{quote|this dictatorship will be all the more salutary and effective for not being dressed up in any official power or extrinsic character.<ref name="Struggle.ws"/>}}\u000a\u000aBakunin was also criticized by Marx<ref name="books.google.co.uk">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta_u2zKfLIkC&pg=PA89] ''Marxism versus Anarchism'' (2001), p88</ref> and the delegates of the [[International Workingmen's Association|International]] specifically because his methods of organization were similar to those of [[Sergey Nechayev]], with whom Bakunin was closely associated.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Adam |url=http://libcom.org/library/marx-bakunin-question-authoritarianism |title=Marx, Bakunin, and the Question of Authoritarianism |publisher=libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> While Bakunin rebuked Nechayev upon discovery of his duplicity as well as his amoral politics, he did retain a streak of ruthlessness, as indicated by a 2 June 1870 letter: "Lies, cunning [and] entanglement [are] a necessary and marvelous means for demoralising and destroying the enemy, though ''certainly not'' a useful means of obtaining and attracting new friends."<ref>Michael Bakunin, \u201cM.

Emphasis added.</ref>\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Bakunin began warning friends about Nechayev's behavior, and broke off all relations with Nechayev. Others note, moreover, that Bakunin never sought to take personal control of the International, that his secret organisations were not subject to his autocratic power, and that he condemned terrorism as counter-revolutionary.<ref>Bakunin, "Program of the International Brotherhood"(1868), reprinted in Bakunin on Anarchism, ed. S. Dolgoff</ref> Robert M. Cutler goes further, pointing out that it is impossible fully to understand either Bakunin's participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] or the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy]], or his idea of a secret revolutionary organisation that is immanent in the people, without seeing that they derive from his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic from the 1840s. The script of Bakunin's dialectic, Cutler argues, gave the Alliance the purpose of providing the International with a real revolutionary organisation.\u000a\u000a{{quote|Marx's advocacy of participation in bourgeois politics, including parliamentary suffrage, would have been proof of [his being a "compromising Negative" in the language of the 1842 "Reaction in Germany" article]. It would have been Bakunin's duty, following the script defined by his dialectic, to bring the [International Working-Men's Association] to a recognition of its true role. [Bakunin's] desire to merge first the League and then the Alliance with the International derived from a conviction that the revolutionaries in the International should never cease to be penetrated to every extremity by the spirit of Revolution. Just as, in Bakunin's dialectic, the consistent Negatives needed the compromisers in order to vanquish them and thereby realize the Negative's true essence, so Bakunin, in the 1860s, needed the International in order to transform its activity into uncompromising Revolution.<ref>Cutler, Robert M., "Introduction" to ''[[The Basic Bakunin: Writings, 1869-1871]]'' (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1992), p. 27, http://www.robertcutler.org/bakunin/basic/intro.html, retrieved 2010-12-29. Cutler also cites Bakunin's "Letter to Pablo," reproduced in Max Nettlau, ''Michael Bakunin: Eine Biographie'' (London: By the Author, 1896\u20131900), p. 284, where Bakunin maintains that the "powerful but always invisible revolutionary collectivity" leaves the "full development [of the revolution] to the revolutionary movement of the masses and the most absolute liberty to their social organization,... but always seeing to it that this movement and this organization should never be able to reconstitute any authorities, governments, or States and always combatting all ambitions collective (such as Marx's) [''sic'' in the original] as well as individual, by the natural, never official, influence of every member of our [International] Alliance [of Socialist-Democracy]."</ref>}}\u000a\u000a===Antisemitism===\u000aIn some of his pieces, Bakunin espouses blatantly [[antisemitic]] views, and has been severely criticized for this part of his writing, not least by anarchists.<ref>Paul McLaughlin. ''Mikhail Bakunin: The Philosophical Basis of His Theory of Anarchism''. 2002. ISBN 1-892941-41-4 p. 4</ref> Bakunin used anti-Jewish sentiments that suggested a Jewish system of global exploitation;\u000a\u000a{{quote|This whole Jewish world, comprising a single exploiting sect, a kind of blood sucking people, a kind of organic destructive collective parasite, going beyond not only the frontiers of states, but of political opinion, this world is now, at least for the most part, at the disposal of Marx on the one hand, and of Rothschild on the other... This may seem strange. What can there be in common between socialism and a leading bank? The point is that authoritarian socialism, Marxist communism, demands a strong centralisation of the state. And where there is centralisation of the state, there must necessarily be a central bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, speculating with the Labour of the people, will be found.<ref>{{harvnb|Judaica|1950|p=101}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|1999|p=340}}</ref>}}\u000a\u000aHowever, antisemitism was not central to Bakunin's work, which stressed [[proletarian internationalism]] and a class analysis of society.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Significantly, Jews would always play a large and prominent role in the anarchist movement, among them [[Emma Goldman]], [[Alexander Berkman]], and [[Voline]].\u000a\u000a===Early nationalism===\u000a\u000aIn his pre-anarchist years, Bakunin's politics were essentially a [[Left-wing nationalism|left-wing form of nationalism]] \u2013 specifically, a focus on East Europe and Russian affairs. While Bakunin, at this time, located the national liberation and democratic struggles of the Slavs in a larger European revolutionary process, he did not pay much attention to other regions. This aspect of his thought dates from before he became an anarchist, and his anarchist works consistently envisaged a global social revolution, including both Africa and Asia. Bakunin as anarchist continued to stress the importance of national liberation, but he now insisted that this issue had to be solved as part of the social revolution. The same problem that (in his view) dogged Marxist revolutionary strategy (the capture of revolution by small elite, which would then oppress the masses) would also arise in independence struggles led by [[nationalism]], unless the working class and peasantry created an anarchy:\u000a\u000a{{quote|I feel myself always the patriot of all oppressed fatherlands. . . Nationality. . . is a historic, local fact which, like all real and harmless facts, has the right to claim general acceptance. . . Every people, like every person, is involuntarily that which it is and therefore has a right to be itself. . . Nationality is not a principle; it is a legitimate fact, just as individuality is. Every nationality, great or small, has the incontestable right to be itself, to live according to its own nature. This right is simply the corollary of the general principal of freedom. -Bukunin [quoted by Alfredo M.
