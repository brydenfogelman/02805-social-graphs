His work centred on [[analytical philosophy]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[history of logic]]. He thought innovatively about traditional [[propositional logic]], the principle of [[principle of contradiction|non-contradiction]] and the [[law of excluded middle]]. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by \u0141ukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The \u0141ukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]  and [[Timothy Smiley]]\u2014which inform modern translations of ''Prior Analytics'' by Robin Smith in 1989 and [[Gisela Striker]] in 2009.<ref>*Review of "Aristotle, Prior Analytics: Book I, Gisela Striker (translation and commentary), Oxford UP, 2009, 268pp., $39.95 (pbk), ISBN 978-0-19-925041-7." in the ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=18787 2010.02.02].</ref> \u0141ukasiewicz is still regarded as one of the most important historians of logic.\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aHe grew up in Lwów and was the only child of Pawe\u0142 \u0141ukasiewicz, a captain in the Austrian army, and Leopoldina (née Holtzer), the daughter of a civil servant. His family was [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].\u000a\u000aHe finished his gymnasium studies in philology and in 1897 went on to [[Lviv University|Lwów University]], which, before the Polish partitions was in Poland, where he studied philosophy and mathematics. In philosophy he was a pupil of [[Kazimierz Twardowski]].\u000a\u000aIn 1902, he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree under the patronage of emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] who gave him a special doctor ring with diamonds.\u000a\u000aHe spent three years as a private teacher, and in 1905 he received a scholarship to complete his philosophical studies at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and the [[Old University of Louvain|University of Louvain]] in Belgium.\u000a\u000a\u0141ukasiewicz continued studying for his [[habilitation]] qualification and in 1906 submitted his thesis to the University of Lwów. In 1906 he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Lwów where he was eventually appointed Extraordinary Professor by Emperor Franz Joseph I. He taught there until the [[World War I|First World War]].\u000a\u000aIn 1915 he was invited to lecture as a full professor at the [[University of Warsaw]] which had re-opened after being closed down by the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist government]] in the 19th century.\u000a\u000aIn 1919 \u0141ukasiewicz left the university to serve as Polish Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education in the [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] government until 1920. \u0141ukasiewicz led the development of a Polish curriculum replacing the Russian, German and Austrian curricula previously used in partitioned Poland. The \u0141ukasiewicz curriculum emphasized the early acquisition of logical and mathematical concepts.\u000a\u000aIn 1928 he married Regina Barwi\u0144ska.\u000a\u000aHe remained a professor at the University of Warsaw from 1920 until 1939 when the family house was destroyed by German bombs and the university was closed under German occupation. He had been a rector of the university twice. In this period \u0141ukasiewicz and [[Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski]] founded the [[Lwów\u2013Warsaw school of logic]] which was later made internationally famous by [[Alfred Tarski]] who had been Le\u015bniewski's student.\u000a\u000aAt the beginning of [[World War II]] he worked at the Warsaw [[Underground University]] as part of the secret system of [[education in Poland during World War II]].\u000a\u000aHe and his wife wanted to move to [[Switzerland]] but couldn't get permission from the German authorities. Instead, in the summer of 1944, they left Poland with the help of [[Heinrich Scholz]] and spent the last few months of the war in [[Münster]], Germany hoping to somehow go on further, perhaps to Switzerland.\u000a\u000aFollowing the war, he emigrated to Ireland and worked at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) until his death.\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aA number of axiomatizations of [[classical logic|classical]] [[propositional logic]] are due to \u0141ukasiewicz. A particularly elegant axiomatization features a mere three [[axioms]] and is still invoked down to the present day. He was a pioneer investigator of [[multi-valued logic]]s; his [[Trivalent logic|three-valued propositional calculus]], introduced in 1917, was the first explicitly axiomatized [[Classical logic|non-classical]] [[propositional calculus|logical calculus]]. He wrote on the [[philosophy of science]], and his approach to the making of scientific theories was similar to the thinking of [[Karl Popper]].\u000a\u000a\u0141ukasiewicz invented the [[Polish notation]] (named after his nationality) for the logical connectives around 1920. There is a quotation from his paper, ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'', page 180;\u000a<blockquote>\u000a"I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924.  I used that notation for the first time in my article \u0141ukasiewicz(1), p. 610, footnote."\u000a</blockquote>\u000aThe reference cited by \u0141ukasiewicz above is apparently a lithographed report in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The referring paper by \u0141ukasiewicz ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'', originally published in Polish in 1931,<ref>\u0141ukasiewicz, Jan, "Uwagi o aksjomacie Nicoda i 'dedukcji uogólniaj\u0105cej'",\u000a("Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and the "Generalizing Deduction"), Ksi\u0119ga pami\u0105tkowa Polskiego Towarzystwa Filozoficznego, Lwów 1931.</ref> was later reviewed by [[Henry Pogorzelski|H. A. Pogorzelski]] in the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' in 1965.<ref>Pogorzelski, H. A., [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2269644 "Reviewed work(s): Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction" by Jan \u0141ukasiewicz; Jerzy S\u0142upecki; Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe"], ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (Sep. 1965), pp. 376\u2013377. This paper by Jan \u0141ukasiewicz was re-published in Warsaw in 1961 in a volume edited by Jerzy S\u0142upecki. It had been published originally in 1931 in Polish.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn \u0141ukasiewicz 1951 book, ''Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the functors before the arguments to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929.<ref>Cf. \u0141ukasiewicz, (1951) ''Aristotle\u2019s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', Chapter IV "Aristotle's System in Symbolic Form" (section on "Explanation of the Symbolism"), p.78 and on.</ref> He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with [[Alfred Tarski]] on the [[Propositional calculus|sentential calculus]].<ref>\u0141ukasiewicz, Jan; Tarski, Alfred, "Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül" ["Investigations into\u000athe sentential calculus"], ''Comptes Rendus des séances de la Société des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie'', Vol. 23 (1930) Cl.

This paper can be found translated into English in Chapter IV "Investigations into the Sentential Calculus", pp.39-59, in ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics: Papers from 1923 to 1938 by Alfred Tarski'', translated into English by J.H. Woodger, Oxford University Press, 1956; 2nd edition, Hackett Publishing Company, 1983</ref>\u000a\u000aThis notation is the root of the idea of the ''recursive stack'', a last-in, first-out computer memory store proposed by several researchers including [[Alan Turing|Turing]], [[Friedrich L. Bauer|Bauer]] and [[Charles Leonard Hamblin|Hamblin]], and first implemented in 1957. In 1960, \u0141ukasiewicz notation concepts and stacks were used as the basis of the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5000]] computer designed by [[Robert S. Barton]] and his team at [[Burroughs Corporation]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The concepts also led to the design of the English Electric multi-programmed [[English Electric KDF9|KDF9]] computer system of 1963, which had two such hardware register stacks. A similar concept underlies the [[reverse Polish notation]] (''RPN'', a postfix notation) of the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130 calculator and its successors, many [[Hewlett Packard]] calculators, the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth programming language]], or the [[PostScript]] page description language.\u000a\u000a==Recognition==\u000aIn 2008 the [[Polish Information Processing Society]] established the Jan \u0141ukasiewicz Award, to be presented to the most innovative Polish IT companies.<ref>[http://2010.imcsit.org/pg/331/261 "2009 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology (IMCSIT)"], conference report</ref>\u000a\u000aFrom 1999 to 2004, the Department of Computer Science building at UCD was called the \u0141ukasiewicz Building, until all campus buildings were renamed after the disciplines they  housed.\u000a\u000a==Chronology==\u000a*1878 born\u000a*1890\u20131902 studies with [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] in Lemberg (Lwów, L'viv)\u000a*1902 doctorate (mathematics and philosophy), [[University of Lviv|University of Lemberg]] with the highest distinction possible\u000a*1906 [[habilitation]] thesis completed, University of Lemberg\u000a*1906 becomes a lecturer\u000a*1910 essays on the principle of non-contradiction and the excluded middle\u000a*1911 extraordinary professor at Lemberg\u000a*1915 invited to the newly reopened University of Warsaw\u000a*1916 new Kingdom of [[Poland]] declared\u000a*1917 develops three-valued propositional calculus\u000a*1919 Polish Minister of Education\u000a*1920\u20131939 professor at [[Warsaw University]] founds with [[Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski]] the [[Lwów\u2013Warsaw school of logic]] (see also [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Stefan Banach]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Zygmunt Janiszewski]], [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]])\u000a*1928 marries Regina Barwi\u0144ska\u000a*1944 flees to Germany and settles in [[Brakel, Germany#Hembsen|Hembsen]], where he was brought for his own safety.\u000a*1946 exile in [[Belgium]]\u000a*1946 offered a chair by the [[Royal Irish Academy]], held at [[University College Dublin]]\u000a*1953 writes autobiography\u000a*1956 dies in [[Dublin]]\u000a\u000a== Selected works ==\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000a\u000a*{{cite book |last=\u0141ukasiewicz |first=Jan | title=Aristotle\u2019s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1951}} 2nd Edition, enlarged, 1957.
