The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...] are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.|source=Peter Kropotkin, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), Conclusion.}}\u000a\u000aKropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not see them as the driving force of history (as did [[capitalist]]s and social Darwinists).<ref name=Gallaher>{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&pg=PA262 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref>{{rp|262}} He believed that seeking out conflict proved socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or [[organized religion|the Church]], which he saw as stifling human [[creativity]] and freedom and impeding human instinctual drive towards sociality and cooperation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&pg=PA349}}</ref>\u000a\u000aKropotkin's observations of cooperative tendencies in [[indigenous people]]s (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) led him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition, such as those of industrialized Europe, and that many societies exhibited cooperation among individuals and groups as the norm. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by, for example, equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when he died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth (see [[Gift economy]]).<ref>\u000aMorris, David.

He believed that should a society be socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services required by it, then no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange will prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\u000a\u000aKropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s [[collectivist]] economic model was simply a wage system by a different name,<ref>Kropotkin wrote: "After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap."

He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labor]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.<ref>{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=[[The Russian Anarchists]]|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28\u201329}}</ref> He further developed these ideas in ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\u000a\u000aAccording to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:<ref name=Sale/>\u000a\u000a{{quote|With ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[Individualist anarchism|individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal anarchism, following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.}}\u000a\u000a===Self-sufficiency===\u000aKropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.
