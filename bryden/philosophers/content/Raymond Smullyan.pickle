He then earned a [[BSc]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1955 and his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1959. He is one of many logicians to have studied under [[Alonzo Church]].<ref name=st-andrews-biography>{{cite web\u000a|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Smullyan.html\u000a|title=Smullyan biography\u000a|publisher=School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences, [[University of St Andrews]]\u000a|author=J J O'Connor and E F Robertson\u000a|date=April 2002\u000a|accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aBorn in Far Rockaway, New York, he showed musical talent, winning a gold medal in a piano competition when he was aged 12.<ref name=st-andrews-biography/> The following year, his family moved to [[Manhattan]] and he attended [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[The Bronx]] as this school offered courses suited to his musical talents, but he left to study on his own as the school did not offer similar courses in mathematics.<ref name=st-andrews-biography/> He attended several colleges, studying mathematics and music.<ref name=st-andrews-biography/>\u000a\u000aWhile a Ph.D. student, Smullyan published a paper in the 1957 ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' showing that Gödelian incompleteness held for [[formal system]]s considerably more elementary than that of Gödel's 1931 landmark paper. The contemporary understanding of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's theorem]] dates from this paper. Smullyan later made a compelling case that much of the fascination with Gödel's theorem should be directed at [[Tarski's indefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]], which is much easier to prove and equally disturbing philosophically.<ref>Smullyan, R M (2001) "Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems" in Goble, Lou, ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to Philosophical Logic''. Blackwell (ISBN 0-631-20693-0).</ref>\u000a\u000aSmullyan is the author of many books on [[recreational mathematics]] and recreational logic. Most notably, one is titled ''What Is the Name of This Book?'' ISBN 0139550623.\u000a\u000aHe was a professor of philosophy at Lehman College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and at [[Indiana University]]. He is also an amateur astronomer, using a six-inch reflecting telescope for which he ground the mirror.<ref name=st-andrews-biography/>\u000a\u000a==Logic problems==\u000aMany of his logic problems are extensions of classic puzzles. [[Knights and Knaves]] involves knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie). This is based on a story of two doors and two guards, one who lies and one who tells the truth. One door leads to heaven and one to hell, and the puzzle is to find out which door leads to heaven by asking one of the guards a question. One way to do this is to ask "Which door would the other guard say leads to hell?". This idea was famously used in the 1986 film ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.\u000a\u000aIn more complex puzzles, he introduces characters who may lie or tell the truth (referred to as "normals"), and furthermore instead of answering "yes" or "no", use words which mean "yes" or "no", but the reader does not know which word means which. The puzzle known as "[[the hardest logic puzzle ever]]" is based on these characters and themes. In his Transylvania puzzles, half of the inhabitants are insane, and believe only false things, whereas the other half are sane and believe only true things. In addition, humans always tell the truth, and [[vampire]]s always lie. For example, an insane vampire will believe a false thing (2 + 2 is not 4) but will then lie about it, and say that it is false. A sane vampire knows 2 + 2 is 4, but will lie and say it is not. And ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' for humans. Thus everything said by a sane human or an insane vampire is true, while everything said by an insane human or a sane vampire is false.\u000a\u000a{{anchor|Forever Undecided}}\u000aHis book ''Forever Undecided'' popularizes [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] [[incompleteness theorem]]s by phrasing them in terms of reasoners and their beliefs, rather than formal systems and what can be proved in them. For example, if a native of a knight/knave island says to a sufficiently self-aware reasoner, "You will never believe that I am a knight", the reasoner cannot believe either that the native is a knight or that he is a knave without becoming inconsistent (i.e., holding two contradictory beliefs). The equivalent theorem is that for any formal system S, there exists a mathematical statement that can be interpreted as "This statement is not provable in formal system S". If the system S is consistent, neither the statement nor its opposite will be provable in it. See also [[Doxastic logic]].\u000a\u000aInspector Craig is a frequent character in Smullyan's "puzzle-novellas."  He is generally called into a scene of a crime that has a solution that is mathematical in nature.  Then, through a series of increasingly harder challenges, he (and the reader) begin to understand the principles in question. Finally the novella culminates in Inspector Craig (and the reader) solving the crime, utilizing the mathematical and logical principles learned. Inspector Craig generally does not learn the formal theory in question, and Smullyan usually reserves a few chapters after the Inspector Craig adventure to illuminate the analogy for the reader. Inspector Craig gets his name from [[William Craig (philosopher)|William Craig]].\u000a\u000aHis book ''[[To Mock a Mockingbird]]'' (1985) is a recreational introduction to the subject of [[combinatory logic]].\u000a\u000aApart from writing about and teaching logic, Smullyan has recently released a recording of his favorite classical piano pieces by composers such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]. Some recordings are available on the Piano Society website, along with the video "Rambles, Reflections, Music and Readings". He has also written an [[autobiography]] titled ''Some Interesting Memories: A Paradoxical Life'' (ISBN 1-888710-10-1).\u000a\u000aIn 2001, documentary filmmaker [[Tao Ruspoli]] made a film about Smullyan called ''[[This Film Needs No Title: A Portrait of Raymond Smullyan]]''.\u000a\u000a==Philosophy==\u000a{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\u000aSmullyan has written several books about [[Taoism|Taoist philosophy]], which he believes neatly solves most or all traditional [[philosophical problem]]s as well as integrating [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]] into a cohesive whole.\u000a\u000a==Selected publications==\u000a{{cleanup|reason=misleading use of links|date=October 2012}}\u000a\u000a===Logic puzzles===\u000a* (1978) ''What Is the Name of This Book?
