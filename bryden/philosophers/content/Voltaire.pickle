He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a [[Satire|satirical]] [[polemic]]ist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and the French institutions of his day.\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aFrançois-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of François Arouet (19 August 1649 \u2013 1 January 1722), a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard (c. 1660 \u2013 13 July 1701), whose family was on the lowest rank of the [[French nobility]].<ref>Pearson, pp. 9\u201314</ref> Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Guérin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune.<ref>Pearson, p. 9</ref> Two of his older brothers\u2014Armand-François and Robert\u2014died in infancy and his surviving brother, Armand, and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively.<ref>Pearson, p. 10</ref> Nicknamed 'Zozo' by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with [[:fr:François de Châteauneuf|François de Castagnère, abbé de Châteauneuf]], and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents.<ref>Pearson, p. 12</ref> He was educated by the [[Jesuits]] at the [[Collège Louis-le-Grand]] (1704\u20131711), where he was taught [[Latin]], theology, and [[rhetoric]];<ref>Pearson, pp. 24\u201325</ref> later in life he became fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/voltaire.htm |title=Voltaire |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://greencardamom.github.io/BooksAndWriters/voltaire.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |dead-url=yes}}</ref>\u000a\u000aBy the time he left school, Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer, against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to become a [[lawyer]].<ref>Pearson, pp. 32\u201333</ref> Voltaire, pretending to work in [[Paris]] as an assistant to a notary, spent much of his time writing poetry. When his father found out, he sent Voltaire to study law, this time in [[Caen]], [[Normandy]]. Nevertheless, he continued to write, producing essays and historical studies. Voltaire's wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed.

From early on, Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government. These activities were to result in two imprisonments and a temporary exile to England. One satirical verse, in which Voltaire accused the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Régent]] of incest with his own daughter, led to an eleven-month imprisonment in the [[Bastille]].<ref>Fitzpatrick, Martin (2000).

Its origin is unclear. It is an [[anagram]] of ''AROVET LI'', the Latinized spelling of his surname, Arouet, and the initial letters of ''le jeune'' ("the young").<ref>{{cite book\u000a|title=Voltaire\u000a|work=Profiles in literature series\u000a|author=Christopher Thacker\u000a|publisher=Taylor & Francis\u000a|year=1971\u000a|isbn=978-0-7100-7020-3\u000a|page=3\u000a|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=D5s9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA3\u000a}}</ref> According to a family tradition among the descendants of his sister, he was known as ''le petit volontaire'' ("determined little thing") as a child, and he resurrected a variant of the name in his adult life.<ref>Pearson, p. 17</ref> The name also [[Verlan|reverses the syllables]] of [[Airvault]], his family's home town in the [[Poitou]] region.<ref>Pearson, p. 24</ref>\u000a\u000a[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Holmes, Richard|title=Sidetracks: explorations of a romantic biographer|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|pages=345\u2013366}} and "Voltaire's Grin" in ''New York Review of Books'', 30 November 1995, page. 49\u201355</ref> supports the anagrammatic derivation of the name, but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey its connotations of speed and daring. These come from associations with words such as ''[[Equestrian vaulting|voltige]]'' (acrobatics on a trapeze or horse), ''[[volte-face]]'' (a spinning about to face one's enemies), and ''volatile'' (originally, any winged creature). "Arouet" was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation, especially given that name's resonance with ''à rouer'' ("to be beaten up") and ''roué'' (a ''débauché'').\u000a\u000aIn a letter to [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]] in March 1719, Voltaire concludes by asking that, if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter, he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire. A postscript explains: "''J'ai été si malheureux sous le nom d'Arouet que j'en ai pris un autre surtout pour n'être plus confondu avec le poète Roi''", (I was so unhappy under the name of Arouet that I have taken another, primarily so as to cease to be confused with the poet Roi.)<ref>[http://www.e-enlightenment.com/item/voltfrVF0850079_1key001cor \u2013 "Voltaire to Jean Baptiste Rousseau, c. 1 March 1719"].

He continued to write plays, such as ''Mérope'' (or ''La Mérope française'') and began his long research into science and history. Again, a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile, during which he had been strongly influenced by the works of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Voltaire strongly believed in Newton's theories; he performed experiments in [[optics]] at Cirey,<ref>Pearson, p. 138</ref> and was one of the sources for the famous story of Newton and the apple falling from the tree, which he had learned from Newton's niece in London and first mentioned in his ''Letters''.<ref name=P82/>\u000a\u000aIn the fall of 1735, Voltaire was visited by [[Francesco Algarotti]], who was preparing a book about Newton in Italian.<ref>Pearson, p. 137</ref> Partly inspired by the visit, the Marquise translated Newton's Latin ''Principia'' into French in full, and it remained the definitive French translation into the 21st century.<ref name="Shank" /> Both she and Voltaire were also curious about the philosophies of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a contemporary and rival of Newton.

Voltaire's second essay in English had been "Essay upon the Civil Wars in France". It was followed by ''La Henriade'', an epic poem on the French [[King Henri IV]], glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the [[Edict of Nantes]], and by a historical novel on King [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. These, along with his ''Letters on the English'' mark the beginning of Voltaire's open criticism of intolerance and established religions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy, particularly [[metaphysics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with being and with what lies beyond the material realm such as whether or not there is a God and whether people have souls. Voltaire and the Marquise analysed the Bible, and concluded that much of its content was dubious.<ref>Pearson, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> Voltaire's critical views on religion are reflected in his belief in [[separation of church and state]] and religious freedom, ideas that he had formed after his stay in England.\u000a\u000aIn August 1736, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] initiated a correspondence with Voltaire.<ref>Pearson, pp. 143\u2013144</ref> That December, Voltaire moved to [[Holland]] for two months and became acquainted with the scientists [[Herman Boerhaave]] and [['s Gravesande]].<ref>Pearson, pp. 151\u2013152</ref> From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels, at first with the Marquise, who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]].<ref>Pearson, pp. 162\u2013164</ref> In July 1740, he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher, van Duren, from printing without permission Frederick's ''[[Anti-Machiavel]]''.<ref>Pearson, p. 166</ref> In September Voltaire and Frederick met for the first time in [[Moyland Castle]] near [[Cleves]] and in November Voltaire was Frederick's guest in Berlin for two weeks;<ref>Pearson, pp. 167\u2013170</ref> in September 1742 they met in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]].<ref>Pearson, p. 173</ref> Voltaire was sent to Frederick's court in 1743 by the French government, as an envoy and spy to gauge Frederick's military intentions in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref>Pearson, pp. 175\u2013177</ref>\u000a[[File:Tafelrunde.PNG|thumb|''Die Tafelrunde'' by [[Adolph von Menzel]].

A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.<ref>Guillaume de Syon, "Voltaire," in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=1270\u201372}}</ref>}}\u000a\u000aVoltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. The ''Essay on Customs'' traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context, thereby rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference. Influenced by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]]'s ''Discourse on the Universal History'' (1682), he was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. He treated Europe as a whole, rather than a collection of nations. He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization, but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.\u000a\u000aVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on "History" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'': ''"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population."'' Voltaire's histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sakmann, Paul |title=The Problems of Historical Method and of Philosophy of History in Voltaire|journal=History and Theory|volume= 11|issue=4 |year=1971|pages=24\u201359|jstor=2504245}}</ref><ref>Gay, Peter (1988) ''Voltaire's Politics''</ref> Yale professor [[Peter Gay]] says Voltaire wrote "very good history", citing his "scrupulous concern for truths", "careful sifting of evidence", "intelligent selection of what is important", "keen sense of drama", and "grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gay, Peter |title=Carl Becker's Heavenly City|journal=Political Science Quarterly|year=1957|volume=72|pages=182\u201399|jstor=2145772}}</ref>\u000a\u000a=== Poetry ===\u000aFrom an early age, Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse and his first published work was poetry. He wrote two book-long epic poems, including the first ever written in French, the ''[[Henriade]]'', and later, ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'', besides many other smaller pieces.\u000a\u000aThe ''Henriade'' was written in imitation of [[Virgil]], using the [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]] couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century, with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages. The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes. [[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|''La Pucelle'']], on the other hand, is a [[burlesque]] on the legend of [[Joan of Arc]]. Voltaire's minor poems are generally considered superior to either of these two works.\u000a\u000a=== Prose ===\u000a[[File:VoltaireCandidFrontis+Chap01-1762.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Frontispiece and first page of an early English translation by T. Smollett et al. of Voltaire's ''[[Candide]]'', 1762]]\u000aMany of Voltaire's [[prose]] works and romances, usually composed as pamphlets, were written as [[polemics]]. ''[[Candide]]'' attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz's philosophy of [[optimism]]; ''L'Homme aux quarante ecus'' (''The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver''), certain social and political ways of the time; ''[[Zadig]]'' and others, the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible. In these works, Voltaire's ironic style, free of exaggeration, is apparent, particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment. ''Candide'' in particular is the best example of his style.\u000aVoltaire also has, in common with [[Jonathan Swift]], the distinction of paving the way for science fiction's philosophical irony, particularly in his ''[[Micromégas]]'' and the vignette ''[[Plato's Dream]]'' (1756).\u000a\u000a[[File:Voltaire-Baquoy.gif|thumb|Voltaire at [[Frederick the Great]]'s ''[[Sanssouci]]'', by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]]]]\u000a\u000aIn general, his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire's other works. Almost all of his more substantive works, whether in verse or prose, are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another, which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone. In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings, he displays his skills at journalism. In pure literary criticism his principal work is the ''[[Commentaires sur Corneille|Commentaire sur Corneille]]'', although he wrote many more similar works{{spaced ndash}}sometimes (as in his ''Life and Notices of Molière'') independently and sometimes as part of his ''Siècles''.\u000a\u000aVoltaire's works, especially his private letters, frequently contain the word ''"l'infâme"'' and the expression ''"écrasez l'infâme"'', or "crush the infamous". The phrase refers to abuses of the people by royalty and the clergy that Voltaire saw around him, and the superstition and intolerance that the clergy bred within the people.<ref>{{cite book |last=Palmer |first=R.R. |author2=Colton, Joel  |title=A History of the Modern World |year=1950 |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. |isbn=0-07-040826-2 }}</ref> He had felt these effects in his own exiles, the burnings of his books and those of many others, and in the hideous sufferings of [[Jean Calas]] and [[François-Jean de la Barre]].

He is incorrectly credited with writing, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." These were not his words, but rather those of [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]], written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book ''[[The Friends of Voltaire]]''. Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire's attitude towards [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and his controversial book ''De l'esprit'', but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire's attitude towards Helvetius; it had been said Hall's summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche, in which he was reported to have said, "I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write."<ref>{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |author2=George, John  |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation, as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.<ref>Charles Wirz, archivist at the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva, recalled in 1994, that Hall 'wrongly' placed this quotation between speech marks in two of her works about Voltaire, recognising expressly the quotation in question was not one, in a letter of 9 May 1939, which was published in 1943 in volume LVIII under the title "Voltaire never said it" (pp. 534\u20135) of the review ''Modern language notes'', Johns Hopkins Press, 1943, Baltimore. An extract from the letter: 'The phrase "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" which you have found in my book ''Voltaire in His Letters'' is my own expression and should not have been put in inverted commas. Please accept my apologies for having, quite unintentionally, misled you into thinking I was quoting a sentence used by Voltaire (or anyone else but myself).' The words "my own" were underlined personally by Hall in her letter. To believe certain commentators \u2013 Norbert Guterman, ''A Book of French Quotations'', 1963 \u2013 Hall was referencing back to a Voltaire letter of 6 February 1770 to an abbot le Riche where Voltaire supposedly said, "Reverend, I hate what you write, but I will give my life so that you can continue to write." The problem is that, if you consult the letter itself, the sentence there does not appear, nor even the idea: "A M LE RICHE A AMIENS. 6 February. You left, Sir, des Welches for des Welches. You will find everywhere barbarians obstinate. The number of wise will always be small. It is true \u2026 it has increased; but it is nothing in comparison with the stupid ones; and, by misfortune, one says that God is always for the big battalions. It is necessary that the decent people stick together and stay under cover. There are no means that their small troop could tackle the party of the fanatics in open country. I was very sick, I was near death every winter; this is the reason, Sir, why I have answered you so late. I am not less touched by it than your memory. Continue to me your friendship; it comforts me my evils and stupidities of the human genre. Receive my assurances, etc." Voltaire, however, did not hesitate to wish censure against slander and personal libels. Here is what he writes in his "Atheism" article in the ''Dictionnaire philosophique'': "Aristophanes (this man that the commentators admire because he was Greek, not thinking that Socrates was Greek also), Aristophanes was the first who accustomed the Athenians to consider Socrates an atheist. \u2026 The tanners, the shoemakers and the dressmakers of Athens applauded a joke in which one represented Socrates raised in the air in a basket, announcing there was God, and praising himself to have stolen a coat by teaching philosophy. A whole people, whose bad government authorized such infamous licences, deserved well what it got, to become the slave of the Romans, and today of the Turks."</ref>\u000a\u000aVoltaire's first major philosophical work in his battle against ''"l'infâme"'' was the ''Traité sur la tolérance'' (''[[Treatise on Tolerance]]''), exposing the Calas affair, along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras (for example, by the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks and the Chinese). Then, in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', containing such articles as "Abraham", "Genesis", "Church Council", he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs, as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets, Voltaire criticized France's colonial policy in North America, dismissing the vast territory of [[New France]] as "[[a few acres of snow]]" (''"quelques arpents de neige"'').\u000a\u000a=== Letters ===\u000aVoltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life, totalling over 20,000 letters.

[[National Gallery of Art]]]]\u000aVoltaire perceived the French [[bourgeoisie]] to be too small and ineffective, the [[aristocracy]] to be parasitic and corrupt, the commoners as ignorant and superstitious, and the [[Catholic Church|Church]] as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings, although all too often, even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy, which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/voldemoc.html|title=The Philosophical Dictionary|accessdate=1 July 2008|chapter=Democracy|publisher=Knopf|year=1924}}</ref> Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change, given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy, and that it was in the king's rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects. But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works, his novella ''[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'' (''Candide, or Optimism,'' 1759), which ends with a new conclusion: "It is up to us to cultivate our garden." His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. ''Candide'' was also burned and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain 'Demad' in a letter, where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |title=Letter on the subject of Candide, to the Journal encyclopédique July 15, 1759|accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013194545/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |archivedate = 13 October 2006}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHe is remembered and honoured in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for [[civil rights]] (as the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of religion]]) and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. The ''Ancien Régime'' involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three [[Estates General (France)|Estates]]: clergy and nobles on one side, the commoners and middle class, who were burdened with most of the taxes, on the other. He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] [[Confucius]].<ref name=liu53 />\u000a\u000aVoltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms, such as ''"Si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer"'' ("If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him"), contained in a verse epistle from 1768, addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors|The Three Impostors]]''. But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for, it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as [[d'Holbach]], [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]], and others.<ref>Gay, Peter ''Voltaire's Politics: The Poet as Realist'' (New Haven:Yale University 1988), p. 265: "If the heavens, despoiled of his august stamp could ever cease to manifest him, if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Let the wise proclaim him, and kings fear him."</ref> He has had his detractors among his later colleagues.
