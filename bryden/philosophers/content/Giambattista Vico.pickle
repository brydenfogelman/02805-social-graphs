He criticized the expansion and development of modern [[rationalism]] and was an apologist for [[Classical Antiquity]]; Vico is best known for his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', the ''[[Scienza Nuova]]'' (1725, ''New Science'').\u000a\u000aVico is a precursor of systemic- and complexity-thinking, as opposed to [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] analysis and other kinds of [[reductionism]]. Furthermore, Vico can be credited with the first exposition of the fundamental aspects of [[social science]] and of [[semiotics]], though his views did not necessarily influence the first social scientists.\u000a\u000aHe is also well known for noting that ''Verum esse ipsum factum'' ("True itself is fact" and "The true itself is made"), a proposition perceived as an early instance of [[constructivist epistemology]].<ref>[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], ''An Introduction to Radical Constructivism''.</ref><ref>[[Bizzell and Herzberg, 800]], ''The Rhetorical Tradition''.</ref>\u000a\u000aVico is considered to have inaugurated modern [[philosophy of history]], although the term is not in his texts, Vico speaks of a "history of philosophy narrated philosophically".<ref>The contemporary, dominant interpretation of Vico owes much to Donald Philip Verene; see: 2002 "Giambattista Vico", ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', Steven M. Nadler, Ed. London:Blackwell Publishing, ISBN 0-631-21800-9. p. 570.</ref> Although not an [[historicism|historicist]], interest in Vico usually has been driven by historicists, such as [[Isaiah Berlin]],<ref>Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas</ref> and [[Hayden White]].<ref>(1976), "The Topics of History: The Deep Structure of the New Science", Giambattista Vico, "Science of Humanity", Giorgio Tagliacozzo and Donald Philip Verene, Eds.

Attempts to inaugurate a non-historicist interpretation of Vico are found in ''Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy'' [http://www.interpretationjournal.com/], Spring 2009, Vol. 36.2, and Spring 2010 37.3; and in ''Historia Philosophica'', Vol. 11, 2013 [http://www.libraweb.net/sommari.php?chiave=5].</ref>\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aBorn to a bookseller and the daughter of a carriage maker in [[Naples]], Italy, Vico attended a series of grammar schools, but ill-health and dissatisfaction with [[Jesuit]] [[scholasticism]] led to home schooling. Evidence from his autobiographical work points to the likelihood Vico was mostly self-taught. According to Costelloe,<ref name="SEP">{{cite web|last=Costelloe|first=Timothy|title=Giambattista Vico|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vico/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref> this was due to his father's influence on him during a three-year absence from school caused by a fall at the age of seven. \u000a\u000aVico received his formal higher education at the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]] from which he graduated in 1694 as Doctor of Civil and Canon Law.<ref name="SEP"/>\u000a\u000aAfter a bout of [[typhus]] in 1686, he accepted a tutoring position in Vatolla (a ''[[Frazione]]'' of the ''[[comune]]'' of [[Perdifumo]]), south of [[Salerno]], that would last till 1695.<ref name="SEP"/>\u000a\u000aIn 1699, he married a childhood friend, Teresa Caterina Destito, and took a chair in [[rhetoric]] at the University of Naples.<ref name="SEP"/> Throughout his career, Vico would aspire to, but never attain, the more respectable chair of jurisprudence. In 1734, however, he was appointed royal historiographer by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], king of Naples, and was offered a salary far surpassing that of his professorship. Vico retained the chair of rhetoric until ill-health forced him to retire in 1741.\u000a\u000a==The ''Scienza Nuova''==\u000a{{main|Scienza Nuova}}\u000a[[File:Vico La scienza nuova.gif|left|thumb|''Principj di Scienza Nuova'' - title page of 1744 edition.]]\u000aThe ''New Science'' (1725, original title ''Scienza Nuova'') is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history, and for historicists like Isaiah Berlin and Hayden White.\u000a\u000a==The ''verum factum'' principle==\u000aVico is best known for his ''verum factum'' principle, first formulated in 1710 as part of his ''De antiquissima Italorum sapientia, ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda'' (1710) ("On the most ancient wisdom of the Italians, unearthed from the origins of the Latin language").<ref>His wording was "Verum et factum reciprocantur seu convertuntur" ("The true and the made are convertible into each other"), an idea which can be found also in [[occasionalism]] and [[Scotism|Scotist]] [[scholasticism]]</ref> The principle states that truth is verified through creation or invention and not, as per [[René Descartes|Descartes]], through observation: \u201cThe criterion and rule of the true is to have made it. Accordingly, our clear and distinct idea of the mind cannot be a criterion of the mind itself, still less of other truths. For while the mind perceives itself, it does not make itself.\u201d This criterion for truth would later shape the history of [[civilization]] in Vico\u2019s opus, the ''[[Scienza Nuova]]'' (''The New Science'', 1725), because he would argue that civil life{{spaced ndash}}like [[mathematics]]{{spaced ndash}}is wholly constructed.\u000a\u000a==Vichian rhetoric and humanism==\u000aVico's version of rhetoric is often seen as the result of both his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[pedagogic]] concerns. In ''De Nostri Temporis Studiorum Ratione'' ("On the Order of the Scholarly Disciplines of Our Times"), presented at the commencement ceremonies of 1708, Vico argued that whoever \u201cintends a career in public life, whether in the courts, the senate, or the pulpit\u201d should be taught to \u201cmaster the art of topics and defend both sides of a controversy, be it on nature, man, or politics, in a freer and brighter style of expression, so he can learn to draw on those arguments which are most probable and have the greatest degree of [[verisimilitude]]\u201d (however, in his "[[Scienza Nuova]]", Vico denounces as "false eloquence" one defending both sides in controversies). As Royal Professor of Latin Eloquence, it was Vico\u2019s task to prepare students for higher studies in law and [[jurisprudence]].  His lessons thus dealt with the formal aspects of the rhetorical canon, including arrangement and delivery.  Yet as the above oration also makes clear, Vico chose to emphasize the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] connection of rhetoric with [[dialectic]] or [[logic]], thereby reconnecting rhetoric to ends (or topics) as their center. Vico's objection to modern rhetoric is that it cuts itself off from common sense (''sensus communis''), as the sense common to all men.  In his lectures and throughout the body of his work, Vico's rhetoric begins from a central [[argument]] or "middle term" (''medius terminus'') which it then sets out to clarify by following the order of things as they arise in our experience. [[Probability]] and circumstance retain their proportionate importance, and [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]&nbsp;\u2013 reliant upon topics or ''loci''&nbsp;\u2013 supersedes [[axiom]]s derived through reflective abstraction. In the tradition of classical Roman rhetoric, Vico sets out to educate the [[orator]] as the deliverer of the "oratio", a speech having "ratio" or reason/order at its heart. What is essential to the oratorical art (as the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u1fe5\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, ''rh\u0113torik\u0113'') is the orderly link between common sense and an end commensurate with it \u2014 an end that is not imposed upon the [[imagination]] from above (in the manner of the moderns and a certain dogmatic form of Christianity), but that is drawn out of common sense itself.  In the tradition of Socrates and Cicero, Vico's real orator or rhetorician will serve as midwife in the birth of "the true" (as a form or idea) out of "the certain" (as the confusion or ignorance of the student's particularized mind).\u000a\u000aVico's rediscovery of "the most ancient wisdom" of the senses (a wisdom that is "human foolishness" or ''humana stultitia''), his emphasis on the importance of civic life, and his professional obligations remind us of the humanist tradition.  He would call for a maieutic or jurisprudential oratory art against the grain of the modern privileging of a dogmatic form of reason in what he called the \u201cgeometrical method\u201d of Descartes and the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]] [[logician]]s.\u000a\u000a==Response to the Cartesian method==\u000aAs he relates in his autobiography, Vico returned to Naples from Vatolla to find "the physics of Descartes at the height of its renown among the established men of letters." Developments in both [[metaphysics]] and the natural sciences abounded as the result of Cartesianism. Widely disseminated by the Port Royal Logic of [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]], Descartes's method was rooted in verification: the only path to truth, and thus knowledge, was through axioms derived from observation. Descartes's insistence that the "sure and indubitable" (or, "clear and distinct") should form the basis of reasoning had an obvious impact on the prevailing views of logic and discourse. Studies in rhetoric{{spaced ndash}}indeed all studies concerned with civic discourse and the realm of probable truths{{spaced ndash}}met with increasing disdain.\u000a\u000aVico's humanism and professional concerns prompted an obvious response that he would develop throughout the course of his writings: the realms of verifiable truth and human concern share only a slight overlap, yet reasoning is required in equal measure in both spheres. One of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the ''De Italorum Sapientia'', where Vico argues that\u000a{{quote|to introduce geometrical method into practical life is "like trying to go mad with the rules of reason," attempting to proceed by a straight line among the tortuosities of life, as though human affairs were not ruled by capriciousness, temerity, opportunity, and chance. Similarly, to arrange a political speech according to the precepts of geometrical method is equivalent to stripping it of any acute remarks and to uttering nothing but pedestrian lines of argument.}}\u000aVico's position here and in later works is not that the Cartesian method is irrelevant, but that its application cannot be extended to the civic sphere. Instead of confining reason to a string of verifiable axioms, Vico suggests (along with the ancients) that appeals to ''phron\u0113sis'' (\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 or [[practical wisdom]]) must also be made, and likewise appeals to the various components of [[persuasion]] that comprise rhetoric. Vico would reproduce this argument consistently throughout his works, and would use it as a central [[wikt:tenet|tenet]] of the ''[[Scienza Nuova]]''.\u000a\u000a==Influences==\u000a\u000aHe has been called the 'sleeping partner' of the Enlightenment.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 0710077467|location = London|pages = 4}}</ref> He was largely unknown in his own time, read only in his native Naples. Nonetheless his ideas are remarkably similar to later Enlightenment thinkers. It was not until the 1820s that his writing was recognised, although somewhat reconfigured by the French Romantic historians.<ref name=":0" />\u000a\u000aWhilst Karl Marx only mentions Vico once in his works, Vico's ideas run, at least, in parallel with Marx.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Capital, Book 1|last = Marx|first = Karl|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = Book 1, part IV, chapter 13, n.89 (footnote)}}</ref> Both Vico and Marx write about societal class struggles. Their ideas involve all men achieving equal rights. Vico calls this the "age of men". Marx concludes with this state as being the optimal ending point of societal change, but Vico believes this complete equality will lead to chaos and a breakdown in society. Vico displayed his stance on the need for religion, as opposed to Marx, when he declared Providence is needed to keep society in order.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chaix-Ruy|first=Jules-Marie|title=Giambattista Vico|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/627497/Giambattista-Vico|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000aEdward Said states that his book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' is indebted to Vico; he mentions Vico 13 times.<ref name="Orientalism">{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Penguin Classics|year = 2003 |origyear=1978|isbn = |location = |pages = xviii, 4-5}}</ref> Said traces Vico's influence in many philosophers through the twentieth century. Said writes that Vico's \u201cideas anticipate and later infiltrate the line of German thinkers I am about to cite. They belong to the era of Herder and Wolf, later to be followed by Goethe, Humboldt, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, and finally the great Twentieth Century Romance philologists Erich Auerbach, Leo Spitzer, and Ernst Robert Curtius.\u201d<ref name="Orientalism" /> For Said, Vico as a humanist and early philologist represented \u201ca different alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work,\u201d<ref name="Orientalism" /> which differed from mainstream Western prejudice against the Orient and the dominating \u201cstandardization\u201d that came with modernity and culminated in National Socialism. Vico, according to Said, saw the interdependence of human history and cultures as organically bound together. Said believes historians and scholars \u201cmust take seriously Vico's great observation that men make their own history, that what they can know is what they have made, and extend it to geography. As geographical and cultural entities \u2014 to say nothing of historical entities \u2014 such locales, regions, and geographical sectors as "Orient" and "Occident" are man-made."<ref name="Orientalism" />\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a*Vico, Giambattista.
