Al-Ghazali argued that Aristotelianism, especially as presented in the writings of Avicenna, was self-contradictory and an affront to the teachings of [[Islam]].

Before 1150, only a few of Aristotle's works existed in translation in Latin Europe, although the tradition of great philosophers and poets of antiquity continued to be studied and copied in the Greek [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. It was to some degree through the [[Latin language|Latin]] translations of Ibn Rushd's work beginning in the thirteenth century, that the legacy of Aristotle was recovered in the Latin West.\u000a\u000aIbn Rushd's work on Aristotle spans almost three decades, and he wrote commentaries on almost all of Aristotle's work except for Aristotle's ''Politics'', to which he did not have access. Hebrew translations of his work also had a lasting impact on [[Jewish philosophy]]. [[Moses Maimonides]], [[Samuel ibn Tibbon|Samuel Ben Tibbon]], Juda Ben Solomon Choen, and [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera|Shem Tob Ben Joseph Falaquera]] were Jewish philosophers influenced by Ibn Rushd.<ref>{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=132}}</ref> His ideas were assimilated by [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and others (especially in the [[University of Paris]]) within the [[Christian]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition which valued Aristotelian logic. Famous scholastics such as Aquinas did not refer to him by name, simply calling him "The Commentator" and calling Aristotle "The Philosopher."  Ibn Rushd had no discernible influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times.<ref>{{harvard citation|Leaman|2002|p=28}}</ref> His death coincides with a change in the culture of Al-Andalus.  In his work ''Fasl al-Maq\u0101l'' (translated a. o.{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} as ''The Decisive Treatise''), he stresses the importance of analytical thinking as a prerequisite to interpret the [[Qur'an]].\u000a\u000a==Jurisprudence and law==\u000aIbn Rushd is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the Maliki school. Perhaps his best-known work in this field is "Bid\u0101yat al-Mujtahid wa Nih\u0101yat al-Muqta\u1e63id, " a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework, which is rendered in English as ''The Distinguished Jurist's Primer''<ref>Nyazee, The Distinguished Jurist's Primer, 2 vols. (Reading: Garnet Publishing 1994 & 1996)</ref>\u2014. He is also the author of "al-Bay\u0101n wa'l-Ta\u1e25\u1e63\u012bl, wa'l-Shar\u1e25 wa'l-Tawj\u012bh wa'l-Ta`l\u012bl fi Mas\u0101'il al-Mustakhraja, " a long and detailed commentary based on the "Mustakhraja" of Mu\u1e25ammad al-`Utb\u012b al-Qurtub\u012b.\u000a\u000a==Legacy==\u000a* Reflecting the deference that some [[medieval]] [[Europe]]an scholars paid to him, Ibn Rushd is named by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' along with the thinkers and creative minds of ancient Greece and Rome whose spirits dwell in "the place that favor owes to fame" in [[Limbo]].\u000a* Ibn Rushd appears in a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], entitled "[[Averroes's Search]]", in which he is portrayed trying to find the meanings of the words ''[[tragedy]]'' and ''[[comedy]]''. He is briefly mentioned in the novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] alongside [[Maimonides]]. He appears to be waiting outside the walls of the ancient city of Cordoba in [[Alamgir Hashmi]]'s poem "In Cordoba".\u000a* The claim that Ibn Rushd deserves equal respect with Maimonides got the fictional Balthazar Abrabanel banished from Amsterdam by the Amsterdam rabbinate in Eric Flint's novel ''1634''.\u000a* Ibn Rushd is also the title of a play called "The Gladius and The Rose", written by Tunisian writer [[Mohamed Ghozzi]], and which took first prize in the theater festival in Charjah in 1999.\u000a* In his [[Joseph Anton: A Memoir|memoir]], persecuted British Indian novelist [[Salman Rushdie]] recalls that his father adopted the family name "Rushdie" in honour of Averroes (Ibn Rushd). Ibn Rushd also appears as a character in Rushdie's novel, "[[Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights]]".\u000a* The [[asteroid]] [[8318 Averroes]] was named in his honor.<ref>Ana Ruiz, ''Vibrant Andalusia: The Spice of Life in Southern Spain'', p. 42.</ref>\u000a* Plant genus ''[[Averrhoa]]'' was named after him.\u000a* A [[lunar crater]], [[Ibn-Rushd (crater)|ibn Rushd]], was also named in his honor\u000a* The Muslim pop musician [[Kareem Salama]] composed and performed a song in 2007 titled "Aristotle and Averroes".\u000a* Ibn Rushd is the subject of the film [[Destiny (1997 film)|''Al Massir'' (''Destiny'')]] by [[Youssef Chahine]].\u000a* The [[Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought]], awarded since 1999, is named after him.\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[List of Arab scientists and scholars]]\u000a* [[List of Islamic studies scholars]]\u000a* [[Kalam cosmological argument]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist|30em}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a* {{Citation |last= Averroes |first= Translated by Ralph Lerner |title= Averroes On Plato's Republic |publisher= [[Cornell University Press]] |year= 2005 |month= |isbn= 0-8014-8975-X }}\u000a* {{Citation |last=Fakhry |first=Majid |title=Averroes (Ibn Rushd) His Life, Works and Influence |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |year=2001 |isbn=1-85168-269-4 }}\u000a* Campanini, Massimo.
