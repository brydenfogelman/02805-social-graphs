V{{Other people|William Johnson}}\u000a'''William Ernest Johnson''' (23 June 1858 \u2013 14 January 1931), usually cited as '''W. E. Johnson''', was a British [[logician]] mainly remembered for his ''Logic'' (1921\u20131924), in 3 volumes. In 1924, in volume III he introduced the important concept of [[Exchangeable random variables|exchangeability]].<ref>Zabell (1992)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aJohnson graduated [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] and was Sidgwick lecturer in Moral Sciences. He was elected a [[Fellow]] of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in March 1902,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=17 March 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36717| }}</ref> and taught there for nearly thirty years.<ref>{{acad|id=JHN878WE|name=Johnson, William Ernest}}</ref> He wrote a bit on economics, and [[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of his students. Johnson was a colleague of Keynes's father, [[John Neville Keynes]]. He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].\u000a\u000a''Logic'' was dated at the time of its publication, and Johnson can be seen as a member of the British logic "old guard" pushed aside by the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Yet an article entitled "The Logical Calculus" (Johnson 1892) reveals that he had nontrivial technical capabilities in his youth, and that he was significantly influenced by the formal logical work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The article begins as follows:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a"As a material machine economises the exertion of force, so a symbolic calculus economises the exertion of intelligence ... the more perfect the calculus, the smaller the intelligence compared to the results."\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a[[A.N. Prior]]'s ''Formal Logic'' cites this article several times. \u000a\u000aJohn Passmore tells us:\u000a<blockquote>\u000a"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as \u201costensive definition\u201d, such contrasts as those between ... \u201cdeterminates\u201d and \u201cdeterminables\u201d, \u201ccontinuants\u201d and \u201coccurrents\u201d, are now familiar in philosophical literature" (Passmore 1966, p. 344).\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a* [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness, Ivor]] (2000), ''The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870\u20131940''.
