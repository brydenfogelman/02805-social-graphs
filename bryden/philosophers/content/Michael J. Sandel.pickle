Sandel''' ({{IPAc-en|s|æ|n|\u02c8|d|\u025b|l}}; born March 5, 1953) is an American [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] and a professor at [[Harvard University]]. He is best known for the Harvard course "Justice" and for his critique of [[John Rawls]]' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in his first book, ''[[Liberalism and the Limits of Justice]]'' (1982). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Education==\u000a{{BLP sources section|date=February 2016}}\u000aSandel was born in [[Minneapolis]] to a [[Jew]]ish family, which moved to [[Los Angeles]] when he was thirteen. He was president of his senior class at [[Palisades Charter High School|Palisades High School]] (1971) and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Brandeis University]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[politics]] (1975). He received his doctorate from [[Balliol College, Oxford]], as a [[Rhodes Scholar]], where he studied under philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]].\u000a\u000a==Philosophical views==\u000a{{Listen|filename=Michael Sandel BBC Radio4 The Reith Lecture 30 June 2009 b00lb6bt.flac|title=<center>Michael J. Sandel's voice</center>|type=speech|description=<center>[[:File:Michael Sandel BBC Radio4 The Reith Lecture 30 June 2009 b00lb6bt.flac|Recorded June 2009]] from the BBC Radio 4 programme the [[Reith Lectures]]</center>}}\u000a{{Republicanism sidebar}}\u000a{{Communitarianism sidebar}}\u000aSandel subscribes to a certain version of [[communitarianism]] (although he is uncomfortable with the label), and in this vein he is perhaps best known for his critique of [[John Rawls]]' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Rawls' argument depends on the assumption of the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], which he claims allows us to become "unencumbered selves".\u000a\u000aSandel's view is that we are by nature encumbered to an extent that makes it impossible even in the hypothetical to have such a veil. Some examples of such ties are those with our families, which we do not make by conscious choice but are born with, already attached. Because they are not consciously acquired, is it impossible to separate oneself from such ties.  Sandel believes that only a less-restrictive, looser version of the veil of ignorance should be postulated. Criticism such as Sandel's inspired Rawls to subsequently argue that his theory of justice was not a "metaphysical" theory but a "political" one, a basis on which an overriding consensus could be formed among individuals and groups with many different moral and political views.<ref>[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/RawlsJustice.pdf "Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical"], by John Rawls</ref>\u000a\u000a==Teaching==\u000a\u000a===Justice===\u000aSandel has taught the famous "Justice"<ref>[http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/jmr/ Justice: A Journey in Moral Reasoning, Michael J. Sandel]</ref> course at [[Harvard]] for two decades. More than 15,000 students have taken the course, making it one of the most highly attended in Harvard's history. The fall 2007 class was the largest ever at [[Harvard]], with a total of 1,115 students.<ref>Makarchev, Nikita. "[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=519668 Sandel Wins Enrollment Battle]."

Across three programs, Sandel debates with the audience whether universities should give preference to students from poorer backgrounds, whether a nurse should be paid more than a banker, and whether it is right to bribe people to be healthy. The programmes were made available for download via the BBC podcast ''Michael Sandel: The Public Philosopher''.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/r4sandel</ref>\u000a\u000a=== edX ===\u000aSandel is currently teaching his Justice course on [[edX]].<ref name=edx>https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-er22-1x-justice-1408#.U0OzEVd_3pc</ref>\u000aOn April 29, 2013, the Philosophy Department faculty of San Jose State University addressed an open letter to Professor Sandel protesting the use of MOOC's (Massively Open Online Courses) such as his Justice course.<ref>http://chronicle.com/article/The-Document-an-Open-Letter/138937/</ref> Professor Sandel publicly responded: "[t]he worry that the widespread use of online courses will damage departments in public universities facing budgetary pressures is a legitimate concern that deserves serious debate, at edX and throughout higher education. The last thing I want is for my online lectures to be used to undermine faculty colleagues at other institutions." <ref>http://chronicle.com/article/Michael-Sandel-Responds/139021/</ref>\u000a\u000a=== Other teaching ===\u000aSandel also co-teaches, with [[Douglas Melton]], the seminar "Ethics and Biotechnology", which considers the ethical implications of a variety of biotechnological procedures and possibilities.\u000a\u000a==Authorship==\u000aSandel is the author of several publications, including ''Democracy's Discontent'' and ''Public Philosophy''. ''Public Philosophy'' is a collection of his own previously published essays examining the role of morality and justice in American political life. He offers a commentary on the roles of moral values and civic community in the American electoral process&mdash;a much-debated aspect of the 2004 U.S. election cycle and of current political discussion.\u000a\u000aMichael Sandel gave the 2009 [[List of Reith Lectures|Reith Lectures]] on "A New Citizenship" on BBC Radio, addressing the 'prospect for a new politics of the common good'.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kj2dw BBC Radio 4 Programme details for Start the Week, 25 May 2009].</ref> The lectures were delivered in [[London]] on May 18, [[Oxford]] on May 21, [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] on May 26, and [[Washington, D.C.]], in early June, 2009.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/05/michael-sandel-reith-lectures-radio-4 ''Guardian'', 5 February 2009, "Michael Sandel to deliver Radio 4's Reith Lectures"].</ref>\u000a\u000aHe is also the author of the book ''What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets'' (2012), which argues some desirable things - such as body organs and the right to kill endangered species - should not be traded for cash.<ref>A summary and critical review of Sandel's book is available in the September/October 2013 issue of [[Philosophy Now]] magazine, accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/98/What_Money_Cant_Buy_The_Moral_Limits_of_Markets_by_Michael_Sandel here.]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Public service==\u000aSandel served on the [[George W. Bush]] administration's [[President's Council on Bioethics]].\u000a\u000a==2009 immigration commentary==\u000aIn 2009, Sandel criticized [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Gary Becker]]'s market immigration proposal. This proposed solution entailed imposing refugee quotas on nations according to their wealth and then allowing countries to pay other, poorer countries to take refugees allotted under their quota.<ref>{{YouTube|TBmCb7nancc|Should We Sell American Citizenship? - Michael Sandel}} ForaTv</ref> Sandel concludes that "a market in refugees changes our view of who refugees are and how they should be treated. It encourages the participants \u2014 the buyers, the sellers and also those whose asylum is being haggled over \u2014 to think of refugees as burdens to be unloaded or as revenue sources rather than as human beings in peril."<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6485444.ece Timesonline.co.uk]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Awards and honors==\u000a{{expand list|date=September 2012}}\u000a*2012 [[Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award]], shortlist, ''What Money Can\u2019t Buy: The Moral Limits Of Markets'' <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/63c168bc-fd98-11e1-8fc3-00144feabdc0.html |title=Biographies and economics dominate |work=Financial Times |first=Andrew |last=Hill |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref>\u000a*2012 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top Global Thinker]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,38 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|date=26 November 2012 |work=Foreign Policy |accessdate=28 November 2012 |archivedate=28 November 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CViUyRpk |deadurl=no}}</ref>\u000a*2014 Honorary doctorate, [[Utrecht University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pers.uu.nl/utrechtse-eredoctoraten-voor-filosoof-michael-sandel-en-psychobioloog-bj-casey/ |title=Utrechtse eredoctoraten voor filosoof Michael Sandel en psychobioloog BJ Casey |work=Utrecht University |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a* {{cite book |title= Democracy's Discontent : America in Search of a Public Philosophy | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, Mass |year= 1998 |isbn= 9780674197459 }}\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[American philosophy]]\u000a*[[List of American philosophers]]\u000a* [[Communitarianism]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist|500px}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a{{wikiquote}}\u000a* [http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/faculty/michael-sandel Harvard University Bio]\u000a* [http://nigelwarburton.typepad.com/philosophy_bites/2009/05/michael-sandel-on-what-shouldnt-be-sold.html Podcast interview with Nigel Warburton on ''Philosophy Bites'' on What Shouldn't Be Sold]\u000a* [http://embryo.asu.edu/handle/10776/2095 "The Case Against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering, by Michael J.
