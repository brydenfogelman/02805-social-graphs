He was a brother to theologian [[Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten]] (1706\u20131757).\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aBaumgarten was born in [[Berlin]] as the fifth of seven sons of the [[pietist]] [[pastor]] of the [[garrison]], Jacob Baumgarten, and of his wife Rosina Elisabeth. Both his parents died early, and he was taught by Martin Georg Christgau where he learned [[Hebrew]] and became interested in [[Latin]] [[poetry]].\u000a\u000aWhile the meanings of words often change as a result of cultural developments, Baumgarten's reappraisal of [[aesthetics]] is often seen as a key moment in the development of [[aesthetic philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caygill|first1=Howard|title=Aesthetics and Civil Society: Theories of Art and Society, 1640-1790|date=1982|location=University of Sussex|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Aesthetics_and_Civil_Society.html?id=cOwrnQEACAAJ}}</ref> Previously the word ''aesthetics'' had merely meant "sensibility" or "responsiveness to stimulation of the senses" in its use by ancient writers. With the development of [[art]] as a commercial enterprise linked to the rise of a ''[[nouveau riche]]'' class across Europe, the purchasing of art inevitably lead to the question, "what is good art?". Baumgarten developed aesthetics to mean the study of good and bad "[[Taste (sociology)|taste]]",  thus good and bad art, linking good taste with beauty.\u000a\u000aBy trying to develop an idea of good and bad taste, he also in turn generated philosophical debate around this new meaning of aesthetics. Without it, there would be no basis for aesthetic debate as there would be no objective criterion, basis for comparison, or reason from which one could develop an objective argument.\u000a\u000a==Views on aesthetics==\u000a\u000a[[File:Aesthetica.png|thumb|alt=Alt text|''Aesthetica'' (1750) by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]]\u000aBaumgarten appropriated the word ''aesthetics'', which had always meant "sensation", to mean taste or "sense" of beauty. In so doing, he gave the word a different significance, thereby inventing its modern usage. The word had been used differently since the time of the ancient Greeks to mean the ability to receive stimulation from one or more of the five bodily senses. In his ''Metaphysic'', § 451, Baumgarten defined taste, in its wider meaning, as the ability to judge according to the senses, instead of according to the intellect. Such a judgment of taste he saw as based on feelings of pleasure or displeasure. A science of aesthetics would be, for Baumgarten, a deduction of the rules or principles of artistic or natural beauty from individual "taste". Baumgarten may have been motivated to respond to Pierre Bonhours' opinion, published in a pamphlet in the late 17th century, that Germans were incapable of appreciating art and beauty.\u000a\u000a==Reception==\u000aIn 1781, Kant declared that Baumgarten's aesthetics could never contain objective rules, laws, or principles of natural or artistic beauty.\u000a\u000a{{quote|text=The Germans are the only people who presently (1781) have come to use the word ''aesthetic[s]'' to designate what others call the critique of taste. They are doing so on the basis of a false hope conceived by that superb analyst Baumgarten. He hoped to bring our critical judging of the beautiful under rational principles, and to raise the rules for such judging to the level of a lawful science. Yet that endeavor is futile. For, as far as their principal sources are concerned, those supposed rules or criteria are merely empirical. Hence they can never serve as determinate ''a priori'' laws to which our judgment of taste must conform. It is, rather, our judgment of taste which constitutes the proper test for the correctness of those rules or criteria. Because of this it is advisable to follow either of two alternatives. One of these is to stop using this new name ''aesthetic[s]'' in this sense of critique of taste, and to reserve the name ''aesthetic[s]'' for the doctrine of sensibility that is true science. (In doing so we would also come closer to the language of the ancients and its meaning. Among the ancients the division of cognition into ''aisth\u0113tá kai no\u0113tá'' [sensed or thought] was quite famous.) The other alternative would be for the new ''aesthetic[s]'' to share the name with speculative philosophy. We would then take the name partly in its transcendental meaning, and partly in the psychological meaning. (''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 1, note.)}}\u000aNine years later, in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', Kant conformed to Baumgarten's new usage and employed the word ''aesthetic'' to mean the judgment of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] or the estimation of the beautiful. For Kant, an aesthetic judgment is subjective in that it relates to the internal feeling of pleasure or displeasure and not to any qualities in an external object.\u000a\u000aIn 1897, [[Leo Tolstoy]], in his ''[[What is Art?]]'', criticized Baumgarten's book on aesthetics. Tolstoy opposed "Baumgarten's trinity &mdash; Good, Truth and Beauty\u2026."<ref name="What7">''[[What is Art?]]'', VII</ref> Tolstoy asserted that "these words not only have no definite meaning, but they hinder us from giving any definite meaning to existing art\u2026."<ref name="What7" /> Baumgarten, he said, claimed that there are three ways to know perfection: "Beauty is the perfect (the absolute) perceived by the senses. Truth is the perfect perceived by reason. The good is the perfect attained by the moral will."<ref>''[[What is Art?]]'',  III</ref> Tolstoy, however, contradicted Baumgarten's theory and claimed that good, truth, and beauty have nothing in common and may even oppose each other. \u000a \u000a{{quote|text=\u2026the arbitrary uniting of these three concepts served as a basis for the astonishing theory according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure\u2026came to be regarded as the highest art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the empty amusement of idle people.(''[[What is Art?]]'', VII.)}}\u000a\u000aWhatever the limitations of Baumgarten's theory of aesthetics, [[Frederick Copleston]] credits him with playing a formative role in German aesthetics, extending [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s philosophy to topics that Wolff did not consider, and demonstrating the existence of a legitimate topic for philosophical analysis that could not be reduced to abstract logical analysis.<ref name="FC">Frederick Copleston (1946\u20131975).
