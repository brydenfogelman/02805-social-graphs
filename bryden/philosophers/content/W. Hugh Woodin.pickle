He has made many notable contributions to the theory of [[inner model]]s and [[determinacy]]. A type of [[large cardinal]], the [[Woodin cardinal]], bears his name.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000a\u000aBorn in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], Woodin earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984 under [[Robert M. Solovay]]. His dissertation title was ''Discontinuous Homomorphisms of C''(''Omega'') ''and Set Theory''. He served as [[chairman|chair]] of the Berkeley mathematics department for the 2002\u20132003 academic year. Woodin is a managing editor of the [[Journal of Mathematical Logic]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2000.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHe is the great-grandson of [[William Hartman Woodin]], former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000aHe has done work on the theory of generic multiverses and related concept of [[\u03a9-logic]] which suggested an argument that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is either undecidable or false in the sense of [[mathematical platonism]]. Woodin criticizes this view arguing that it leads to a counterintuitive reduction in which all truths in the set theoretical universe can be decided from a small part of it. He claims that these and related mathematical results lead (intuitively) to the conclusion that Continuum Hypothesis has a [[truth value]] and the Platonistic approach is reasonable.\u000a\u000aWoodin now predicts that there should be a way of constructing an inner model for almost all known large cardinals which he calls the Ultimate L and which would have similar properties as [[Constructible_universe|Gödel's constructible universe]]. In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis would be true in this universe.{{fact|date=April 2013}}<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wolchover, Natalie|title=To Settle Infinity Dispute, a New Law of Logic|journal=Quanta Magazine|date=26 November 2013|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20131126-to-settle-infinity-question-a-new-law-of-logic/}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[AD+]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a*{{MathGenealogy|id=11957}}\u000a*{{cite book|last = Woodin|first = W.
