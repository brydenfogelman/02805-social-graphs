He was an associate of [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (he at one time courted one of his sisters),<ref>{{cite book|last=Leier|first=Mark|year=2006|pp=68|title=[[Bakunin: The Creative Passion]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-58322-894-4|ref=harv}}</ref> and other critical intellectuals. Belinsky played one of the key roles in the career of poet and publisher [[Nikolay Nekrasov]] and his popular magazine ''[[Sovremennik]]''.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aBorn in [[Sveaborg]] (now part of [[Helsinki]]), Vissarion Belinsky lived in the town of Chembar (now [[Belinsky, Penza Oblast|Belinsky]] in [[Belinsky District]] of [[Penza Oblast]]) and in [[Penza]], where he studied in [[:ru:\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f \u2116 1 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0412. \u0413. \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e|gymnazia]] (1825\u20141829). In 1829\u20141832 he was a student of [[Moscow University]]. In Moscow he published his first famous articles.\u000a\u000aIn 1839 Belinsky went to [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]], Russia, where he became a respected critic and editor of two major [[literary magazine]]s: ''[[Otechestvennye Zapiski]]'' ("Notes of the Fatherland"), and ''Sovremennik'' ("The Contemporary"). In both magazines Belinsky worked with younger [[Nikolay Nekrasov]].\u000a\u000aHe was unlike most of the other Russian intellectuals of the 1830s and 1840s. The son of a rural medical doctor, he was not a wealthy aristocrat. The fact that Belinsky was relatively underprivileged meant, among other effects, that he was mainly self-educated, unlike Alexander Herzen or Mikhail Bakunin, this was partly due to being expelled from Moscow University for political activity. But it was less for his philosophical skill that Belinsky was admired and more for emotional commitment and fervor. \u201cFor me, to think, to feel, to understand and to suffer are one and the same thing,\u201d he liked to say. This was, of course, true to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ideal, to the beliefs that real understanding comes not only from mere thinking ([[reason]]), but also from intuitive insight. This combination of thinking and feeling pervaded Belinsky\u2019s life.\u000a\u000aIdeologically, Belinsky shared, but with exceptional intellectual and moral passion, the central value of most of [[Westernizer]] [[intelligentsia]]: the notion of the individual self, a person (lichnost\u2019(\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c)), that which makes people human, and gives them [[dignity]] and rights. With this idea in hand (which he arrived at through a complex intellectual struggle) faced the world around him armed to do battle. He took on much conventional philosophical thinking among educated Russians, including the dry and [[abstraction|abstract philosophizing]] of the German [[idealists]] and their Russian followers. In his words, \u201cWhat is it to me that the Universal exists when the individual personality [lichnost\u2019] is suffering.\u201d  Or: \u201cThe fate of the individual, of the person, is more important than the fate of the whole world.\u201d Also upon this principle, Belinsky constructed an extensive critique of the world around him (especially the Russian one). He bitterly criticized [[autocracy]] and [[serfdom]] (as \u201ctrampling upon everything that is even remotely human and noble\u201d) but also [[poverty]], [[prostitution]], drunkenness, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] coldness, and cruelty toward the less powerful (including women). \u000a 	\u000aBelinsky worked most of his short life as a literary critic. His writings on literature were inseparable from these moral judgments. Belinsky believed that the only realm of freedom in the repressive reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] was through the written word. What Belinsky required most of a work of literature was \u201ctruth.\u201d This meant not only a probing portrayal of real life (he hated works of mere fantasy, or escape, or aestheticism), but also commitment to \u201ctrue\u201d ideas\u2014the correct moral stance (above all this meant a concern for the dignity of individual people):  As he told [[Nikolai Gogol]] (in a famous letter) the public \u201cis always ready to forgive a writer for a bad book [i.e. aesthetically bad], but never for a pernicious one [ideologically and morally bad].\u201d  Belinsky viewed Gogol's recent book, ''Correspondence with Friends'', as pernicious because it renounced the need to \u201cawaken in the people a sense of their human dignity, trampled down in the mud and the filth for so many centuries.\u201d\u000a\u000aF.M. Dostoevsky read aloud at several public events Belinsky's letter, which called for the end of serfdom. A secret press was assembled to print and distribute Belinsky's letter. For these offenses Dostoevsky was arrested, convicted and condemned to death in 1849, a sentence later commuted to 4 years incarceration in the [[katorga|prison camps of Siberia]].<ref>"Dostoevsky", Joseph Frank, pps 157-73</ref>\u000a\u000aIn his role as perhaps the most influential liberal critic and ideologist of his day, Belinsky advocated literature that was socially conscious. He hailed [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'' (1845), however, Dostoevsky soon thereafter broke with Belinsky.<ref name="demons">{{Citation\u000a  | last = \u000a  | first = \u000a  | author-link = \u000a  | title = Commentaries on Demons by Fyodor Dostoevsky\u000a  | journal = Soviet Academy of Sciences\u000a  | publication-place = New York\u000a  | place = Leningrad\u000a  | publisher = Alfred A.

At that time Belinsky published his ''Literary Review for the Year 1847''.\u000a\u000aIn 1848, shortly before his death, Belinsky granted full rights to Nikolay Nekrasov and his magazine, ''The Contemporary'' ("Sovremennik"), to publish various articles and other material originally planned for an almanac, to be called the Leviathan.\u000a\u000aBelinsky died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] on the eve of his arrest by the [[Tsar]]'s police on account of his political views. In 1910, Russia celebrated the centenary of his birth with enthusiasm and appreciation.\u000a\u000aHis surname has variously been spelled ''Belinsky'' or ''Byelinski''. His works, in twelve volumes, were first published in 1859&ndash;1862.  Following the expiration of the copyright in 1898, several new editions appeared.  The best of these is by S. Vengerov; it is supplied with profuse notes.\u000a\u000aBelinsky early supported the work of [[Ivan Turgenev]]. The two became close friends and Turgenev fondly recalls Belinsky in his book ''Literary Reminiscences and Autobiographical Fragments''. The British writer [[Isaiah Berlin]] has a chapter on Belinsky on his 1978 book ''Russian Thinkers''. Here he points out some deficiencies of Belinsky's critical insight:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>''He was wildly erratic, and all his enthusiasm and seriousness and integrity do not make up for lapses of insight or intellectual power. He declared that Dante was not a poet; that Fenimore Cooper was the equal of Shakespeare; that ''Othello'' was the product of a barbarous age...''</blockquote>\u000a\u000aBut further on in the same essay, Berlin remarks:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>''Because he was naturally responsive to everything that was living and genuine, he transformed the concept of the critic's calling in his native country.  The lasting effect of his work was in altering and altering crucially and irretrievably, the moral and social outlook of the leading younger writers and thinkers of his time.  He altered the quality and the tone both of the experience and of the expression of so much Russian thought and feeling that his role as a dominant social influence overshadows his attainments as a literary critic.''\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000aBerlin's book introduced Belinsky to playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], who included Belinsky as one of the principal characters (along with [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Turgenev]]) in his trilogy of plays about Russian writers and activists: [[The Coast of Utopia]] (2002)\u000a\u000a==English translations==\u000a*''Selected Philosophical Works'', Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1956.\u000a*''Belinsky, Chernyshevsky & Dobrolyubov: Selected Criticism'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1976.\u000a\u000a==Streets named after Belinsky==\u000aBelinsky Street and Belinsky Lane, close to Red Square in Moscow, were named after Belinsky from 1920-1994.<ref>[[:ru:\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0443\u043b\u043e\u043a]]</ref>  Many streets elsewhere in Russia still bear his name.\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Literature==\u000a*[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''Russian Thinkers'', London, 1978\u000a*[[Alexander Herzen]].
