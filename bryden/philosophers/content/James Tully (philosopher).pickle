V'''James Hamilton Tully''' (born 1946) is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Law, Indigenous Governance and Philosophy at the [[University of Victoria]], Canada. His research and teaching comprise a [[public philosophy]] that is grounded in place (Canada) yet reaches out to the world of civic engagement with the problems of our time. He does this in ways that strive to contribute to dialogue between academics and citizens. For example, his research areas include the Canadian experience of coping with the deep diversity of multicultural and multinational citizenship; relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous people; and the emergence of citizenship of the living earth as the ground of sustainable futures.<ref>Paraphrased from James Tully, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a4A2pgfbTo \u201cFaces of UVic Research: James Tully\u201d], [[University of Victoria]].</ref>\u000a\u000aTully is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and Emeritus Fellow of the [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation|Trudeau Foundation]].<ref>[http://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/politicalscience/people/directory/emeritusfaculty/tullyjim.php "Bio"], James Tully, Emeritus Faculty, [[University of Victoria]].

A new, fresh and clear synthesis of his previous work on the history of Western political thought, colonialism and post-colonialism, modern constitutionalism, and indigenous peoples, Tully\u2019s book advances an inspiring project that stresses the need for public philosophy to enter into dialogue with citizens engaged in struggles against various forms of injustice and oppression. Public philosophy can throw a critical light on the field of practices in which civic struggles take place and the practices of civic freedom available to change them. The focus upon relationships of normativity and power, and the need to bring them into the light of public scrutiny thanks to the particular academic skills available to the researchers, make public philosophy \u2018in a new key\u2019 distinctively democratic. The breadth and depth of the work, combined with Tully\u2019s focus on civic freedom and the possibility of the reciprocal elucidation of academic work and citizens\u2019 democratic struggles, make it a major and truly inspiring contribution to contemporary political theory," from [http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/cbm-prize.shtml "C.B.

It is an attempt to renew and transform the tradition of [[public philosophy]] so it can effectively address the pressing political problems of our age in a genuinely democratic way. It does this by means of a dual dialogue of reciprocal and mutual learning among equals: between academics in different disciplines addressing the same problems (multidisciplinary); and between academics and citizens addressing the problems and struggles on the ground by their own ways of knowing and doing (democratic). The aim is to throw critical light on contemporary political problems by means of studies that free us to some extent from hegemonic ways of thinking and acting politically, enabling us to test their limits and to see and consider the concrete possibilities of thinking and acting differently.<ref>James Tully, \u201cPublic Philosophy and civic freedom: a guide to the two volumes,\u201d ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom'', and ''Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), pp. 1-11 (both volumes).

They are exchanging their diverse stories and claims as the chief appears to listen attentively to each, hoping to guide them to reach an agreement, without imposing a metalanguage or allowing any speaker to set the terms of the discussion. The chief\u2019s subjection to the rule of mutual recognition is symbolised by the crests of the crew's nations and families carved in the speaker's staff,\u201d Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 24.</ref>  There is no universal constitutional order imposed from above nor a single category of citizenship, because identities and relations change over time.<ref>\u201cSince recognition is never definitive, the particular constitutional arrangement of the members of the canoe is presumably not meant to be fixed once and for all. Constitutional recognition and association change over time, as the canoe progresses and the members change in various ways. A constitution is more like an endless series of contracts and agreements, reached by periodical intercultural dialogues, rather than an original contract in the distant past, an ideal speech-situation today, or a mythic unity of the community in liberal and nationalist constitutionalism,\u201d Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 26.</ref> This view rejects the \u201cmythic unity of the community\u201d imagined \u201cin liberal and nationalist constitutionalism.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 26. The critique of modern, presumptively \u2018universal\u2019 conceptions of citizenship are developed in Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'' & ''II''.</ref>\u000a\u000aTully argues that the concept of \u2018culture\u2019 is more flexible and constructive for thinking about the rival claims of political groups than the more rigid and exclusive concept \u2018nation.\u2019<ref>\u201cThe consequence of national and liberal constitutions, which have been the dominant forms over the last three hundred years, is precisely the contemporary resistance and demands for recognition of the members whose cultures have been excluded, assimilated or exterminated. A just form of constitution must begin with the full mutual recognition of the different cultures of its citizens,\u201d Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', pp. 7-8.</ref>  Culture more readily suggests that group identities are plural, overlapping, and changing over time in their encounters with others. Unlike nationalism, the politics of cultural recognition does not assume that every group aspires to its own culturally homogenous \u2018nation-state.\u2019<ref>\u201cAlthough this has been the dominant form of constitutional recognition since the seventeenth century, it cannot be simply extended to the demands for cultural recognition today,\u201d Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 8.</ref>  Rather, cultures must find ways to share spaces and co-exist. While they may always strive to determine their own identities and relations, pursuant to \u201cself rule, the oldest political good in the world,\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 5.</ref>  the solution is not to crack down on diversity or to impose one cultural model over others.\u000a\u000aThe solution is to broaden opportunities for participation and contestation, to further democratize institutions and relations of governance, including foundational constitutions. According to Tully, \u201ca constitution should not be seen as a fixed set of rules but, rather, as an imperfect form of accommodation of the diverse members of a political association that is always open to negotiation by the members of the association.\u201d<ref>[http://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/politicalscience/people/directory/emeritusfaculty/tullyjim.php \u201cResearch,\u201d] James Tully webpage on [[University of Victoria]] website, accessed 18 November 2014; see also: \u201ca constitution can be both the foundation of democracy and, at the same time, subject to democratic discussion and change in practice,\u201d Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 29.</ref><ref name="methodology-note">A major theme of Tully\u2019s work is a careful reconceptualization or clarification of a series of contested terms, including the notions of constitution, freedom, citizenship, and the adjectives democratic, civic, and global. Tully \u201cre-describes\u201d each to emphasize not static categories or abstract, transcendental or universal qualities, but rather practice or praxis \u2014 dialogical relations, action, and contestation. For more on Tully\u2019s methodological approach, drawing heavily on the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School of thought]], and [[Michel Foucault]], see Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', pp. 4-5, 10, 15-131, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 254-256; see also David Owen, "Series Editor\u2019s Foreword," in James Tully, ''On Global Citizenship: James Tully in Dialogue'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2014), pp. ix-x, Robert Nichols and Jakeet Singh, "Editors' Introduction," ''Freedom and Democracy in an Imperial Context: Dialogues with James Tully'' (London: Routledge, 2014), pp. 1-3.</ref> No aspect of relations should be off limits to deliberation if called into question by participants affected by those relations. This is what Tully means by \u201cdemocratic constitutionalism\u201d as opposed to more conventional \u201cconstitutional democracy.\u201d<ref name="Tully, p. 4">Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 4.</ref>  From this perspective, Tully can claim that \u201c[t]he constitution is thus one area of modern politics that has not been democratised over the last three hundred years.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 28.</ref>\u000a\u000aFor Tully, ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' prefigures a more democratic, pluralistic, and just society. It evokes a simpler, more elegant, and sustainable ethos of gift-reciprocity in all our relationships, human and non-human. Getting along may be messy and imperfect business, but the passengers continue to row cooperatively, and the canoe of society glides onward.<ref>\u201cFor all the celebration of diversity and the vying for recognition, the paddles are somehow in unison and they appear to be heading in some direction [...] This seems to imply that the kind of constitutional change required to meet the just demands for recognition can be carried out without capsizing a society,\u201d Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 28.</ref>\u000a\u000a===Practices of civic freedom and global citizenship===\u000a\u000aIn ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom'', and ''Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom'' (2008), Tully expands his approach \u201cto a broader range of contemporary struggles: over diverse forms of recognition, social justice, the environment and imperialism.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 4. Tully\u2019s work on ''Public Philosophy I'' & ''II'' \u201cleads him to elaborate the implications of his revised view of freedom for multinational democracy and extend his analysis to encompass the history of Western imperialism,\u201d Owen, "Series Editor\u2019s Foreword," in ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. xi-xii. Also, \u201cTully\u2019s aim, then, is to develop alternative notions of freedom and democracy that can be woven into a non-imperial, or in fact de-imperializing, way of life,\u201d Nichols and Singh, "Editors' Introduction," ''Freedom and Democracy'', p. 2.</ref> The two volumes mark a shift toward a principal emphasis on freedom. \u201cThe primary question,\u201d Tully writes, \u201cis thus not recognition, identity or difference, but freedom; the freedom of the members of an open society to change the constitutional rules of mutual recognition and association from time to time as their identities change.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 189. And \u201cFreedom versus domination is thus the emerging focus of politics in multinational societies at the dawn of the new millennium,\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 190.</ref> This is \u201ccivic freedom,\u201d referring to the capacity people have to participate in the constitution of their own governance relations.<ref>\u201cThis is the fundamental democratic or civic freedom of citizens \u2013 having an effective say in a dialogue over the norms through which they are governed,\u201d ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 310. And \u201cTo be free democratically is not only to be able to participate in various ways in accordance with the principles, rules and procedures of the constitutional system, as important as this is, but also, and crucially, always to be able to take one step back, dissent and call into question the principles, rules or procedures by which one is governed and to enter into (rule-governed) deliberations over them,\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 93-94.</ref>\u000a\u000aTo the extent that governance relations restrict this basic freedom, \u201cthey constitute a structure of domination, the members are not self-determining, and the society is unfree."<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 190</ref> Conditions of oppression, however, do not rule out or discount practices of civic freedom. Tully\u2019s public philosophy is not concerned with ideal conditions or hoped-for peaceful futures. Rather, civic freedom exists in conduct and in relations in the \u201chere and now,\u201d<ref>Tully, Public Philosophy I, pp. 20, 154, 288, Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 73, 90, 120-121, 189, 190, 229.</ref> not least under conditions of oppression and conflict. Against violence and tyranny, Tully argues, practices of civic freedom make the best \u201cstrategies of confrontation,\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 280-309.</ref> because they generate conditions for transformative change. The concluding chapter of ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II'' examines \u201cthe democratic means to challenge and transform imperial relationships [and] brings together the three themes of the two volumes: public philosophy, practices of civic freedom and the countless ways they work together to negotiate and transform oppressive relationships.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 8; see especially ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 296-309, and Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 88-97, 305-308.</ref>\u000a\u000aTully\u2019s civics-based approach offers a new way of thinking about a diverse array of contemporary and historical traditions of democratic struggle,<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 51-53; \u201cMiddle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism: A view of the field from the demos,\u201d ''Middle East Law and Governance'', 4 (2012), 225-263.</ref> including environmental movements<ref>Tully, \u201cAn Ecological Ethics for the Present,\u201d in ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 73-88; also pp. 70-72.</ref> and indigenous struggle.<ref>Tully, \u201cThe Struggle of Indigenous Peoples for and of Freedom,\u201d in ''Public Philosophy I'', pp. 257-288</ref> Tully summarizes the approach and its potential:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u2018Practices of civic freedom\u2019 comprise the vast repertoire of ways of citizens acting together on the field of governance relationships and against the oppressive and unjust dimensions of them. These range from ways of \u2018acting otherwise\u2019 within the space of governance relationships to contesting, negotiating, confronting and seeking to transform them. The general aim of these diverse civic activities is to bring oppressive and unjust governance relationships under the on-going shared authority of the citizenry subject to them; namely, to civicise and democratize them from below.<ref name="Tully, p. 4"/></blockquote>\u000a\u000aFrom this perspective, these kinds of powerful, civic movements are not deviations or anomalies to be corrected or appeased through discipline or cooptation, but exemplars of civic freedom.<ref>\u201cThey are classified [by the dominant discourses and institutions] as acts of civil disobedience or rebellion. If these illegal struggles are successful and the extensions institutionalised, then the extensions are redescribed retrospectively as stages in the development of modern citizenship and incorporated within its framework, as in the cases of working-class struggles giving rise to social and economic rights, women gaining recognition as citizens, civil rights movements and recognition of cultural minorities. Thus, what are seen as activities of citizenship by the civic tradition \u2013 struggles for new forms of recognition and extensions of citizenship \u2013 fall outside of modern [conventional] citizenship with its institutional/status orientation,\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 256, also, pp. 298, 308-309.</ref> They disclose their positions or grievances not only through words and stated goals but through the very world they bring into being by their actions: civic \u201cactivists ''have to be the change'' that they wish to bring about.\u201d<ref>Tully, \u201cTwo Traditions of Human Rights,\u201d in ''Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals'', ed. by Matthias Lutz-Bachmann and Amos Nascimento (London: Ashgate, 2014), p. 151, also, 155, 156.</ref> \u201cUnderlying this way of democratization,\u201d Tully argues, \u201cis the Gandhian premise that democracy and peace can be brought about only by democratic and peaceful means.\u201d<ref>Tully, \u201cMiddle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism," ''Middle East Law and Governance'', 4 (2012), p. 228.</ref> However, this is no utopian vision, according to Tully, referring to the \u201cthousands\u201d and \u201cmillions of examples of civic\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 306, 308.</ref> practices everyday that make another world not only possible but \u201c''actual''.\u201d<ref>\u201c''Another world is actual'',\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 301.</ref>\u000a\u000aTo clarify and reinforce this approach, Tully argues for an expanded conception of the term ''citizenship'' to encompass all forms of governance-related conduct, with an emphasis on \u201cnegotiated practices.\u201d<ref name="methodology-note" /><ref name="Tully, p. 248">Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 248.</ref> ''Civic'' or ''global'' citizenship refers to the myriad of relations and practices (global and local) people find themselves embedded and participating in.<ref>\u201cFrom the civic perspective, citizenship comes into being whenever and wherever people who are subject to or affected by practices of governance become active co-agents within them; exercising the powers of having a say (negotiating) and having a hand (powers of self-organization and self-government) in and over the relationships that govern their interaction,\u201d Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 272.</ref> The term ''global'' draws attention to the diverse and overlapping character of governance \u2014 and hence citizen \u2014 relations.<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 243-249.</ref> Modes of civic and global citizenship \u201care the means by which cooperative practices of self-government can be brought into being and the means by which unjust practices of governance can be challenged, reformed and transformed by those who suffer under them.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 272-273.</ref>\u000a\u000aTully carefully distinguishes his expanded notion of citizenship (diverse, cooperative, civic, global) from the narrower but more conventional notion of citizenship, which he calls \u201ccivil citizenship\u201d (modern, institutional, and international).<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 246-309.</ref> Where ''civic'' denotes practice and pluralism, ''civil'' citizenship singularly refers to \u201ca status given by the institutions of the modern constitutional state in international law.\u201d<ref name="Tully, p. 248"/> This kind of (civil) citizenship is associated with the dominant tradition of liberalism, in which the state ensures a free market, a set of negative liberties (especially protections against state infringements into the private sphere), and a narrow range of participation through institutions of free speech and representative government.<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 250-256; see also \u201cTwo Traditions of Human Rights,\u201d in ''Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals'', pp. 139-148.</ref> Tully argues that this dominant module of civil citizenship is neither universal nor inevitable; rather, it is \u201cone singular, historical form of citizenship among others.\u201d<ref name="Tully, p. 248"/> More problematically, the civil tradition often plays handmaiden to empire, insofar as imperial powers operate under international banners of \u2018progress\u2019 and \u2018liberalism\u2019:\u000a<blockquote>the dominant forms of representative democracy, self-determination and democratisation promoted through international law are not alternatives to imperialism, but, rather, the means through which informal imperialism operates against the wishes of the majority of the population of the post-colonial world.<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 158.</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aBy contextualizing and de-centering, or \u201cprovincializing,\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 249.</ref> modern categories of \u201callegedly universal\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 247.</ref> citizenship, Tully aims to broaden and democratize the field of citizenship and citizen practices. \u201cThis [civic and global] mode of citizenship,\u201d he argues, \u201chas the capacity to overcome the imperialism of the present age and bring a democratic world into being.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 243.</ref>\u000a\u000aMore recently, Tully has emphasized the importance of \u201ccoordinating\u201d the different ways that civil (deliberative) and civic (cooperative) citizens address the same political problems, such as social and ecological justice.<ref>Tully, \u201cTwo ways of realizing justice and democracy: Linking Amartya Sen and Elinor Ostrom,\u201d CRISPP, 16.2 (March 2013), pp. 220-233; also, Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 84-100, especially under \u201cJoining hands and working together,\u201d pp. 97-100. To illustrate, \u201cThe life of Gandhi provides an example of how these two modes of citizenship can complement each other. As a representative democrat he supported the Congress Party and representative government, and he reasoned and negotiated endlessly in the official public spheres available to him.[omitted footnote] Yet, he also grounded himself in cooperative citizenship practices of non-violent agonistics and regime change, and in alternative practices of social, economic and ecological self-government,\u201d Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 99.</ref>\u000a\u000a===The transformative power of nonviolence===\u000a\u000aIn the closing pages of ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II'', Tully explicitly links his work to the study and practice of [[nonviolence]]. He identifies four main components of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s life practice of [[Satyagraha]] that offer a model for approaching civic freedom and global citizenship practices: 1) noncooperation with unjust institutions, 2) a commitment to nonviolent means of resistance, 3) a focus on local, community-based modes of self-reliance and self-governance, and 4), as a precursor to these three components, \u201cpersonal practices of self-awareness and self-formation.\u201d<ref>\u201cThe first is active non-cooperation vis-à-vis any imperial (non-civic) relationship and its corresponding idea of one universal civilisation or cosmopolitanism for all. The second is the way of peace. For Gandhi this consists in civic organisation and uncompromising non-violent confrontation and negotiation with those responsible for imperial relationships with the aim of converting them to non-violent, democratic and peaceful relationships. Thirdly, for these two activities to be effective they have to be grounded in the local field and practices of the alternative world you want to bring about. For Gandhi this consists of \u2018constructive work\u2019 in local, self-reliant, civically organised Indian villages and respectful participation in their ways [\u2026]  Fourthly, the first three practices are integrated into a singular style of civic life by the more personal practices of self-awareness and self-formation,\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 308-309.</ref> According to Tully, these cornerstones of nonviolent power \u201care daily practices of becoming an exemplary citizen.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 309</ref>\u000a\u000aTully has since focused increasingly on the study and practice nonviolent ethics and nonviolent resistance.<ref>\u201cSince publishing ''PPNK'' [''Public Philosophy in a New Key''] I have been presenting the best arguments of the antiwar and peace movements against the politics of an economy of violence and enmity and for a politics of nonviolence and compassion,\u201d Tully, ''Democracy and Freedom'', p. 239. See especially Tully, \u201cTwo Traditions of Human Rights,\u201d in ''Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals'', pp. 149-156; Tully, \u201cMiddle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism: A view of the field from the demos,\u201d ''Middle East Law and Governance'', 4 (2012), pp. 225-240, 250-263. \u201cGlobal Disorder and Two Responses,\u201d ''Journal of Intellectual History and Political Thought'', 2.1 (November), pp. 49-62; Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 88-100, 276-319, 325-327, and Tully, ''Freedom and Democracy'', 239-247, 264-266 (there is some overlap between these sources).</ref> For example, he writes,\u000a\u000a<blockquote>the alternative of a politics of reasonable nonviolent cooperation and agonistics (Satyagraha) was discovered in the twentieth century by [[William James]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Abdul Gaffar Khan]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King Junior]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Gene Sharp]], [[Petra Kelly]], [[Johan Galtung]] and [[Barbara Deming]]. They argued that the antagonistic premise of western theories of reasonable violence is false. Nonviolent practices of cooperation, disputation and dispute resolution are more basic and prevalent than violent antagonism. This is a central feature of civic freedom.<ref>Tully, ''Democracy and Freedom'', p. 247.</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aA major overlap between Tully\u2019s civic freedom and the study of nonviolence is the shared emphasis on practice, on methods, on means rather than on ends. \u201cFor cooperative citizens,\u201d Tully writes, \u201cmeans and ends are internally related, like a seed to the full-grown plant, as Gandhi put it.\u201d<ref name="Tully, p. 96">Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 96.</ref> This is because means \u201care pre-figurative or constitutive of ends. Consequently, democratic and peaceful relationships among humans are brought about by democratic and non-violent means."<ref>Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 96</ref>\u000a\u000aTully repudiates the \u201cdepressing history\u201d<ref>\u201cDemocratic citizens have learned from this depressing history that distrust and violence beget distrust and violence and from the history of nonviolence that there is another more powerful way that leads to peace,\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 295.</ref> of \u201cself-defeating violent means.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 99.</ref> He rejects the idea, prevalent across the spectrum of Western political thought, from revolutionaries to reactionaries (the \u201creigning dogma of the left and right\u201d<ref>Tully, ''Freedom and Democracy'', p. 240</ref>) that peaceful and democratic societies can be brought about by coercive and violent means. Rather, according to Tully, \u201cthe means of violence and command relationships do not bring about peace and democracy. They too are constitutive means. They bring about [[security dilemma]]s and the spiral of the command relations necessary for war preparation, arms races and more violence.\u201d<ref name="Tully, p. 96"/>\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, Tully extends his civics-based public philosophy to \u201cpractitioners and social scientists [who] are beginning to appreciate the transformative power of participatory non-violence and the futility of war in comparison.\u201d<ref>Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 97. On the \u201ctransformative power of nonviolence,\u201d see especially ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 306-308: confronting violence with nonviolence "is often considered the fundamental transformative power of non-violence since it transforms the opponents and the relationship between them from one mode of being to another. Along with constructive programmes it is at the core of Gandhi\u2019s Satyagraha. It is called the jiu-jitsu logic of non-violence because it uses the movements and dis-equilibrium of the opponent to bring about the transformation. The non-violent actors are not only offering and suggesting a non-violent alternative in which they can combine their energy and work together rather than wasting it in futile conflict, they also manifest this alternative in their interaction and envelope the violent others in these non-violent and potentially transformative relationships. They are being peace and making peace at one and the same time. Most of the more complex and mediated techniques and strategies of non-violent agonistics are derived from and extend the bodily logic of interaction and transformation of this famous phenomenological prototype. [citing [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]]'s 1934 ''The Power of Nonviolence''] The other technique that is equally important is non-cooperation. As we have seen, the civic tradition claims that unjust regimes rest not on violence or [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured consensus]] but on cooperation in the sense of compliance. Therefore, the basic technique of dealing with an unjust regime from Étienne de la Boétie to the Egyptian Spring and non-violent Intifada is to withdraw cooperation in the everyday reproduction of the unjust system of cooperation," Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 306-307.</ref>\u000a\u000a===Sustainability and Gaia citizenship===\u000aTully\u2019s approach to nonviolent citizenship practices includes relations with the non-human world. Tully argues that Homo Sapiens should see themselves as interdependent civic citizens of the ecological relationships in which they live and breathe and have their being. As such, they have responsibilities to care for and sustain these relationships that, in reciprocity, sustain them and all the other life forms that are interdependent on them.<ref>\u201cCivic citizens are thus \u2018caretakers\u2019 of the goods of the dwelling places in which they live. In so doing, they dissolve the modernist distinction between culture and nature that separates civics from the places in which it is enacted. Every locale and network of locales of civic activity is not only culturally diverse but also a place in the natural world with its web of relationships of biological and ecological diversity. They see the interactive and interdependent relationships between humans and nature as similar in kind to human relationships, and they attend to and care for them in similar ways. They listen and respond carefully to nature as a living being (Gaia) in their ecological sciences and daily practices of treading lightly. Civic citizens realise that this non-metaphorical field of possibilities in human/natural relationships and its limited Spielraum is the ground of all others. They are Gaia citizens,\u201d Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 293.</ref>\u000a\u000aTully\u2019s "[[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] citizenship"<ref>Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 293; Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 93; Tully, \u201cTrust, Mistrust and Distrust in Diverse Societies,\u201d in ''Trust and Distrust in Diverse Societies'', ed. by Dimitrios Karmis, forthcoming; Tully, \u201cReconciliation Here on Earth,\u201d forthcoming ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGzGvxvHz2o video] of talk).</ref> draws on [[earth science]]s and [[list of life sciences|life sciences]] as well as indigenous traditions. For example, pointing to the work of ecological scientists from [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], and [[Barry Commoner]] to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change]], Tully links the unsustainability crisis of the [[Anthropocene]] to his own critique of  \u201cmodern civil\u201d modes of governmentality (as violent, exploitative, and destructive).<ref>Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 93; Tully, \u201cTrust in Diverse Societies,\u201d forthcoming; Tully, \u201cReconciliation Here on Earth,\u201d forthcoming.</ref> Likewise, he points to Indigenous knowledge that conceptualises human interconnectedness with the earth as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|gift-reciprocity relationships]] and as a model for social relationships.<ref>\u201cJust as the living earth consists of gift-reciprocity relationships that sustain the living members, so humans should relate to the living earth and each other in their social relationships in the same general way,\u201d Tully, \u201cReconciliation Here on Earth,\u201d forthcoming; and \u201cMoreover, Indigenous peoples insist that they did not invent this system. Rather, like life and earth scientists today, they observe the gift-reciprocity relationship in the symbiotic and symbiogenetic ecological relationships of interdependency that co-sustain and co-evolve non-human forms of life, and they learn from this how human associations should relate to each other,\u201d Tully, \u201cTrust in Diverse Societies,\u201d forthcoming.</ref> The famous Indigenous artwork ''Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' remains exemplary of democratic and pluralistic ways of thinking and acting \u2013 between humans and the natural environments on which they depend.<ref>\u201cThe canoe is everywhere humans and non-humans dwell together. Wherever we are, we are symbiotically interdependent in the way the passengers are in the canoe. This is why we have responsibilities to respect each other and our diverse ways of living, because, as a matter of fact, they all support each other, like an old growth forest. But, in order to see this, we need to listen patiently to each other and see how the diversity looks from different perspectives, as they are doing,\u201d Tully, \u201cReconciliation Here on Earth,\u201d forthcoming.</ref>\u000a\u000aTully\u2019s argument is that his account of interdependent agents in relationships of governance and situated freedom can be extended with modifications to describe human situatedness in ecological relationships \u2013 as either giving rise to \u2018virtuous\u2019 or \u2018vicious cycles\u2019, depending on how we act in and on them.<ref>\u201cWhether the partners generate trustful and peaceful relationships through virtuous cycles of reciprocal interaction or distrustful and aggressive relationships through vicious cycles of antagonism depends in part on whether they become aware of this interweaving of their identities in the course of their interactions or whether they hold fast to atomism: the false belief that their individual and collective identities exist prior to and independent of encounter and interaction,\u201d Tully, \u201cTrust in Diverse Societies,\u201d forthcoming. And \u201cThe aim is to work together to transform unsustainable relationships into conciliatory and sustainable ones: that is, to transform a vicious social system into a virtuous social system that sustains the ways of life of all affected,\u201d Tully, \u201cReconciliation Here on Earth,\u201d forthcoming.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Selected publications==\u000a\u000a===Books===\u000a* ''Freedom and Democracy in an Imperial Context, Dialogues with James Tully'' (Edited by Robert Nichols, Jakeet Singh), Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-81599-4.
