V{{other people}}\u000a{{sources|date=February 2013}}\u000a'''Edward Nelson''' (May 4, 1932 \u2013 September 10, 2014) was a professor in the Mathematics Department at [[Princeton University]].    He was known for his work on [[mathematical physics]] and [[mathematical logic]].  In mathematical logic, he was noted especially for his [[internal set theory]], and his controversial views on [[ultrafinitism]] and the [[consistency]] of [[Peano arithmetic|arithmetic]]. He also wrote on the relationship between religion and mathematics.\u000a\u000a==Career==\u000a\u000aNelson was born in [[Decatur, Georgia]]. He received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the [[University of Chicago]], where he worked with [[Irving Segal]]. He was a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] from 1956 to 1959.  He held a position at [[Princeton University]] starting in 1959, attaining the rank of professor there in 1964 and retiring in 2013.\u000a\u000aIn 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-02-24.</ref> He died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] on September 10, 2014.<ref>[http://www.math.princeton.edu/news/home-page/professor-emeritus-edward-nelson-passed-away-september-10th ''Professor Emeritus Edward Nelson Passed Away September 10th''] on www.math.princeton.edu/news (retrieved 2014-9-12)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Early work==\u000a\u000aNelson made contributions to the theory of infinite-dimensional [[group representation]]s, the mathematical treatment of [[quantum field theory]], the use of [[stochastic process]]es in [[quantum mechanics]], and the reformulation of [[probability theory]] in terms of [[non-standard analysis]].\u000a\u000aFor many years he worked on [[mathematical physics]] and probability theory, and he retained a residual interest in these fields, particularly in connection with possible extensions of stochastic mechanics to [[field theory (physics)|field theory]].\u000a\u000aIn 1950, Nelson formulated a popular variant of the [[four color problem]]: What is the chromatic number, denoted <math>\u005cchi</math>, of the plane? In more detail, what is the smallest number of colors sufficient for coloring the points of the Euclidean plane in such a way that no two points of the same color are unit distance apart?<ref>p.23, Soifer, Alexander (2008); The Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators; New York: Springer. ISBN 978-0-387-74640-1</ref> We know by simple arguments that 4&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''\u03c7''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;7. The problem was introduced to a wide mathematical audience by [[Martin Gardner]] in his October 1960 [[Mathematical Games]] column. The chromatic number problem, also now known as the [[Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem]], was a favorite of [[Paul Erd\u0151s]], who mentioned it frequently in his problems lectures.\u000a\u000a==Work on foundations==\u000aIn the later part of his career, he worked on mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics. One of his goals was to extend IST ([[Internal Set Theory]]\u2014a version of a portion of [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]]) in a natural way to include external functions and sets, in a way that provides an external function with specified properties unless there is a finitary obstacle to its existence. Other work centered on fragments of arithmetic, studying the divide between those theories interpretable in [[Robinson arithmetic|Raphael Robinson's Arithmetic]] and those that are not; [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], including the problem of whether [[P = NP problem|P is equal to NP or not]]; and automated proof checking.\u000a\u000aIn September 2011, Nelson announced that he had proved that [[Peano arithmetic]] was logically inconsistent.<ref>http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2011-September/015816.html</ref> An error was found in the proof, and he retracted the claim.<ref>http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/09/the_inconsistency_of_arithmeti.html</ref>\u000a\u000a==Publications==\u000a*''Dynamical theory of Brownian motion.''
