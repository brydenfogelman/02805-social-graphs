The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.25.</ref> In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.26-27.</ref>\u000a\u000aSpinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by [[Descartes]], and to optics.\u000a\u000a===Expulsion from the Jewish community===\u000aOn 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: {{hebrew|\u05d7\u05e8\u05dd}}, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against the 23-year-old Spinoza.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.21.</ref> The following document translates the official record of the censure:<ref name="ts66">Steven Nadler, Spinoza: A Life, Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (23 April 2001), ISBN 978-0-521-00293-6, Page: 120</ref>\u000a<blockquote>\u000aThe Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and born witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable ''chachamin'' [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the [[613 commandments|six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts]] which are written therein, with the excommunication with which Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys, and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four [[ell]]s of him, or read anything composed or written by him.</blockquote>\u000a\u000aThe Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual.<ref>Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.

There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.\u000a\u000aFirst, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: "No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God\u2014the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?"<ref>Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri 29 June 2001; substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato.standord.eu]</ref>\u000a\u000aSecond, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former "conversos" who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren. This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch. 2, pp. 17\u201322.</ref> There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But "in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law."<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.19.</ref> Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might "disturb the liberty we enjoy."<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.20.</ref> Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.<ref>See Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.19-21.</ref>\u000a\u000aThird, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his ''Theological-Political Treatise'' that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons,<ref>See Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.28, n.28, p.189.</ref> he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the "monstrous deed," contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.25-25.</ref>\u2014to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal."<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.\u000a\u000aAfter the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an "Apology" (defence), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, "in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances."<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> This "Apology" does not survive, but some of its contents may later have been included in his ''Theological-Political Treatise''.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.22.</ref> For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval biblical commentator [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] intimating that some apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i.e., "[t]he Canaanite was then in the land," Genesis 12:6, which ibn Ezra called a "mystery" and exhorted those "who understand[] it keep silent") were not of [[Mosaic authorship]] as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent.<ref name=":0" />\u000a\u000aThe most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity.<ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012">Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.</ref> Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants, a Christian sect, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian graveyard\u2014but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass.

This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/#4</ref><ref>''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part IV, preface: "''Deus seu Natura''".</ref> Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on [[quantum mechanics]].<ref>http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/spinoza.shtml</ref><ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/#3</ref> Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against "received authority." He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,<ref name=tws9912/> namely a single, fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning "that which stands beneath" rather than "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics.''<ref name=tws908/> Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind\u2013body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do.\u000a\u000aSpinoza contends that "''Deus sive Natura''" is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance. It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests dualism. The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind\u2013body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,";<ref>Baruch Spinoza. ''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans. by Samuel Shirley and ed. by Michael L. Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33.</ref> he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them.\u000aNot only is it impossible for two infinite substances to exist (two infinities being absurd),<ref>''Ethics'', Part I, Proposition 6.</ref> God\u2014being the ultimate substance\u2014cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental substance.\u000a\u000aSpinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do. By forming more "adequate" ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.\u000aTherefore, humans have no free will. They believe, however, that their will is free. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from our human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free but they \u2033dream with their eyes open\u2033. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: "men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined."<ref>''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: "[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire."</ref>\u000a\u000aThis picture of Spinoza's determinism is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in ''Ethics'': \u2033the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. \u2026 All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.\u2033<ref>''Ethics'', Part III, Proposition 2.</ref> Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, \u2033Blame\u2033 and \u2033Praise\u2033 are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false ideal of choice predicated upon this.\u000a\u000aSpinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>Roger Scruton, ''Spinoza, A very Short Introduction'', p.86</ref>\u000a\u000a===Ethical philosophy===\u000aSpinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing.<ref>http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html</ref> Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which "All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection." Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].\u000a\u000a===Spinoza's ''Ethics''===\u000a{{Main|Ethics (Spinoza)}}\u000aIn the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God/Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth. His concept of "[[conatus]]" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.\u000a\u000aAlso in the "Ethics",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics}}</ref> Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be \u201cmutilated, confused, and without order.\u201d {{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|pages=Books 1\u20135}} Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a \u201cpassive\u201d state. This type of \u201cpassive mind\u201d that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.\u000aSpinoza\u2019s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions. He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue. \u000aSpinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind. In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence. This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue. {{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|pages=Books 1\u20135}}\u000a\u000aIn the final part of the "[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]", his concern with the meaning of "true blessedness", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause and so master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge\u2014opinion, reason, intuition\u2014and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.\u000a\u000aGiven Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where "necessity" reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.\u000a\u000a==History of reception==\u000a\u000a===Pantheist, panentheist, or atheist?===\u000a{{Main|Spinozism}}{{see also|Pantheism controversy}}\u000a[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|left|An unfavorable engraving depiction of philosopher Spinoza, captioned in Latin, "A Jew and an Atheist".]]\u000aIt is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the "prophet"<ref>Picton, J. Allanson, "Pantheism: Its Story and Significance", 1905</ref> and "prince"<ref>Fraser, Alexander Campbell "Philosophy of Theism", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p 163</ref> and most eminent expounder of [[pantheism]]. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, "as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".<ref>Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (26 March 2009), ISBN 978-1-60459-156-9, letter 73</ref> For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of Thought and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.\u000a\u000aAccording to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883\u20131969), when Spinoza wrote in ''{{lang|la|Deus sive Natura}}'' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturans]]}}'' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturata]]}}'' (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.<ref name="ts64">Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (23 October 1974), ISBN 978-0-15-684730-8, Pages: 14 and 95</ref> Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).<ref name="ts65">Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), ISBN 978-0-415-10782-2, Page: 40</ref> Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.<ref name=ts64/>\u000a\u000a[[Martial Guéroult]] (1891\u20131976) suggested the term "[[panentheism]]", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.<ref name=ts65/> However, American panentheist philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897\u20132000) insisted on the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe Spinoza's view.<ref>Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an [[atheist]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.\u000a\u000aThe attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:\u000a* the unity of all that exists;\u000a* the regularity of all that happens;\u000a* the identity of spirit and nature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, & Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\u000aBy 1879, Spinoza\u2019s pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.<ref>"The Pantheism of Spinoza Dr. Smith regarded as the most dangerous enemy of Christianity, and as he announced his conviction that it had gained the control of the schools, press and pulpit of the Old World [Europe], and was rapidly gaining the same control of the New [United States], his alarm and indignation sometimes rose to the eloquence of genuine passion."

"Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."<ref>Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt & Co., New York, 1914</ref> Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God<ref>"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings."

(5p35c) And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends ''amor intellectualis dei'' (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man. (5p33) However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1apendix), and Spinoza insists that \u201cneither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God\u201d (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. \u201cHe who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,\u201d says Spinoza (5p19).<ref name="stanford">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/#Per|title=Pantheism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000a[[Steven Nadler]] suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNat |title=Baruch Spinoza (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===\u000aSimilarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authors. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was <blockquote>... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.<ref>Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W.

F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p123</ref> [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity\u2014natura naturans\u2014conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity\u2014as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct out-flowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."<ref>H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308-310. Quest Books</ref>\u000a\u000a===Spinoza's reception in the 20th century===\u000a\u000aLate 20th-century Europe demonstrated a greater philosophical interest in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or [[Marxist]] perspective. [[Karl Marx]] liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as materialistic.<ref name=tws908/> Notable philosophers [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Étienne Balibar]] have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy.

Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914-16'', p.&nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present."

Ives speculates that Spinoza was excommunicated in order to appease Dutch authorities who threatened to expel Amsterdam's Jews because of Spinoza's anti-religious activities amongst the city's Christian community.<ref>Ives 2009.</ref>\u000a*In ''Bento's Sketchbook'' (2011), the writer [[John Berger]] combines extracts from Spinoza, sketches, memoir, and observations in a book that contemplates the relationship of materialism to spirituality.
