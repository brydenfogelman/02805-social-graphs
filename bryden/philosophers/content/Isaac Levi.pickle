In the text Levi offers a [[Decision theory|decision theoretic]] reconstruction of [[epistemology]] with a close-eye towards the classical [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophers like [[William James]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Levi is known for his pioneering work in [[belief revision]] and [[imprecise probability]].\u000a\u000aLevi is one of several doctoral students of [[Ernest Nagel]] who were influential in American post-war philosophy; others were [[Morton White]], [[Patrick Suppes]], [[Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.|Henry Kyburg]], and [[Frederic Schick]]. Levi also served as doctoral advisor to prominent formal philosophers, including [http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-arlocosta.php Horacio Arló-Costa] and [http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-seidenfeld.php Teddy Seidenfeld]. Morgenbesser once quipped that Seidenfeld, who studied under Kyburg as an undergraduate, was Kyburg's revenge upon Levi. There is a rich literature of debate between Kyburg and Levi on topics in what has come to be known as [[formal epistemology]].\u000a\u000a==Major publications==\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = Gambling with truth; an essay on induction and the aims of science | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1973 | isbn = 9780262620260}} Originally issued by Knopf (1967).\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = The enterprise of knowledge: an essay on knowledge, credal probability, and chance | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780262620437}}\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = Hard choices: decision making under unresolved conflict | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780521386302}}\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = For the sake of the argument: ramsey test conditionals, inductive inference and nonmonotonic reasoning | publisher = Cambridge university press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780521039017}}\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = The covenant of reason rationality and the commitments of thought | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781139173032}}\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = Decisions and revisions: philosophical essays on knowledge and value | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780521027625}}\u000a* {{cite book | last = Levi | first = Isaac | title = The fixation of belief and its undoing: changing beliefs through inquiry | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780521110297}}\u000a\u000a=== Chapters in books ===\u000a* {{Citation | last = Levi | first = Isaac | contribution = Convexity and separability in representing consensus | editor-last1 = Kanbur | editor-first1 = Ravi | editor-last2 = Basu | editor-first2 = Kaushik | editor-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | editor-link2 = Kaushik Basu | title = Arguments for a better world: essays in honor of Amartya Sen &#124; Volume I: Ethics, welfare, and measurement | pages = 193\u2013212 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199239115 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[American philosophy]]\u000a* [[List of American philosophers]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2016}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Levi, Issac}}\u000a[[Category:1930 births]]\u000a[[Category:American philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Belief revision]]\u000a[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a\u000a\u000a{{US-philosopher-stub}}
