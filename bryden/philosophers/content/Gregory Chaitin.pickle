Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[metamathematics]], in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Ray Solomonoff]]. Today, [[algorithmic information theory]] is a common subject in any computer science curriculum.\u000a\u000a==Mathematics and computer science==\u000aHe attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and [[City College of New York]], where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Li |last2=Vitanyi |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LKEmB_GQ53QC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&f=false |page=92 |quote=G.J.Chaitin had finished the Bronx High School of Science, and was an 18-year-old undergraduate student at City College of the City University of New York, when he submitted two papers....

Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 book titles that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of [[metabiology]] and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.\u000a\u000a==Other scholarly contributions==\u000aChaitin also writes about [[philosophy]], especially [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]] (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that [[algorithmic information theory]] is the key to solving problems in the field of [[biology]] (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and [[evolution]]) and  [[neuroscience]] (the problem of [[consciousness]] and the study of the mind).\u000a\u000aIn recent writings, he defends a position known as [[digital philosophy]]. In the [[epistemology]] of mathematics, he claims that his findings in [[mathematical logic]] and algorithmic information theory show there are "mathematical facts that are true for no reason, they're true by accident. They are random mathematical facts".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithistory.org/honor-roll/professor-gregory-john-chaitin|title=Professor Gregory John Chaitin|publisher=[[IT History Society]]|accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref> Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a [[quasi-empirical]] methodology.\u000a\u000a==Honors==\u000aIn 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the [[University of Maine]]. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a [[Leibniz Medal (Wolfram Research)|Leibniz Medal]]<ref>Zenil, Hector "Leibniz medallion comes to life after 300 years"\u000a[http://www.mathrix.org/liquid/archives/the-history-of-the-chaitin-leibniz-medallion ''Anima Ex Machina'', The Blog of Hector Zenil], November 3rd, 2007.</ref> by [[Wolfram Research]].
