VAn '''ethicist''' is one whose judgment on [[ethics]] and [[ethical code]]s has come to be trusted by a specific [[community]], and (importantly) is expressed in some way that makes it possible for others to mimic or approximate that judgment. Following the advice of ethicists is one means of acquiring [[propositional knowledge|knowledge]] (see [[argument]], [[appeal to authority|argument from authority]]).<ref>Tjeltveit, Alan C.

This may be due to formal ([[de jure]]) [[Sovereign state|state]] sanction.\u000a\u000aSome jurists have less formal ([[de facto]]) backing by an ethical community, e.g. a [[religious community]].  In [[Islamic Law]], for instance, such a community following ([[taqlid]]) a specific jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) of [[shariah]] mimics judgment of a prior jurist.<ref>Ismael, J. S. and Ismael, T. Y. (1980) "Social Change in Islamic Society: The Political Thought of Ayatollah Khomeini" ''Social Problems'' 27(5): pp. 601-619, page 614</ref>  [[Catholic Canon Law]] has a similar structure.  Such a jurist may be a [[theology|theologian]] or simply a prominent teacher.  To those outside this tradition, the jurist is simply an ethicist who they may more freely disagree with, and whose input on any issue is advisory.  However, they may find it hard to avoid a [[fatwa]] or [[excommunication]] or other such [[shunning]] by the religious community, so it may be hard advice to ignore.\u000a\u000aOutside the [[legal profession]]s and [[spiritual tradition]]s, ethicists are usually considered to be either [[philosophy|philosopher]]s or [[mediation|mediator]]s of disputes. {{Verify source|date=January 2009}}\u000a\u000aThe [[list of ethicists]] demonstrates the extreme range of people who have made, or contributed to, ethical debates.\u000a\u000a==Other meanings==\u000a\u000a"Ethicist" may also mean a person who subscribes to ethicism, which can be defined either as a philosophy based on [[ethics]]<ref name="TFD">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ethicism|title=ethicism - definition of ethicism by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> or "the view that a work of art's moral point of view affects the work's overall aesthetic evaluation".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Halwani|first=Raja|date=February 2009|title=Ethicism, Interpretation, and ''Munich''|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|volume=26|issue=1|pages=71\u201387|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2009.00432.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5930.2009.00432.x/abstract}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/Gaut%20on%20Ethicism%20and%20Artistic%20Value.htm|title=Gaut on Ethicism and&nbsp; Artistic Value -- Outline|last=Gracyk|first=Theodore|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> "Ethicist" may also mean a person with a tendency to [[moralizing|moralize]].<ref name="TFD" />\u000a\u000a==Notes==\u000a<!--<nowiki> \u000aSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags.\u000a</nowiki>-->\u000a<references />\u000a\u000a{{Ethics}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a[[Category:Ethics]]
