We were discussing the distribution of income, and whether you should have progressive income taxes. Some of the people there were expressing the view that there could be a justification for it.</blockquote>\u000a<blockquote>Another occasion which is equally telling: Fritz Machlup was a student of Mises's, one of his most faithful disciples. At one of the Mont Pelerin meetings, Machlup gave a talk in which I think he questioned the idea of a gold standard; he came out in favor of floating exchange rates. Mises was so mad he wouldn't speak to Machlup for three years. Some people had to come around and bring them together again. It's hard to understand; you can get some understanding of it by taking into account how people like Mises were persecuted in their lives.</blockquote>\u000a\u000aEconomist [[Murray Rothbard]], who studied under Mises, agreed he was uncompromising, but disputes reports of his abrasiveness.

To view it as something more would be a fatal error.</blockquote>\u000a\u000aMises biographer Jörg Guido Hülsmann says that critics who suggest that Mises supported fascism are "absurd", as he notes that the full quote describes fascism as dangerous.
