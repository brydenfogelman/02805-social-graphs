He is Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the [[University of Oxford]], Fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford]], Director of the [[Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics]], Sir Louis Matheson Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Monash University]], and Head of the Melbourne\u2013Oxford Stem Cell Collaboration, which is devoted to examining the ethical implications of [[cloning]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]]. He is the editor of the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'', which is ranked as the [http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=med_bioethics No.1 journal in bioethics] worldwide by Google Scholar Metrics as of 2013. In addition to his background in applied ethics and philosophy, he also has a background in medicine and completed his [[MBBS]] (Hons) at Monash University.\u000a\u000aHe completed his PhD at Monash University, under the supervision of bioethicist [[Peter Singer]].<ref>[http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/uehiro/Savulescu.mp3 Savulescu]. philosophy.ox.ac.uk</ref>\u000a\u000a== Procreative beneficence ==\u000aJulian Savulescu coined the phrase procreative beneficence.

Some have argued that this raises no new ethical issues above those raised by any form of embryo experimentation. I argue that this research is less morally problematic than other embryo research. Indeed, it is not merely morally permissible but morally required that we employ cloning to produce embryos or fetuses for the sake of providing cells, tissues or even organs for therapy, followed by abortion of the embryo or fetus."  He argues that if it is permissible to destroy fetuses, for social reasons, or no reasons at all, it must be justifiable to destroy them to save lives.\u000a\u000aAlong with neuro-ethicist [[Guy Kahane]], Savulescu's article "Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness" appears to be the first mainstream publication to argue that increased evidence of consciousness in patients diagnosed with being in [[persistent vegetative state]] actually ''supports'' withdrawing or withholding care.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1093/jmp/jhn038|title= Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness|journal= Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|year= 2009|last1= Savulescu|first1= J.|last2= Kahane|first2= G.}}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 2009, Professor Savulescu presented a paper at the \u2019Festival of Dangerous Ideas,\u2019 held at the Sydney Opera House in October 2009, entitled "Unfit for Life: Genetically Enhance Humanity or Face Extinction," which appears on Vimeo.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/7515623 Genetically enhance humanity or face extinction \u2013 PART 1 on Vimeo].
