After earning degrees in Economics and Political Science and in Law from the [[University of Athens]], he moved to London in 1966 for postgraduate study at the [[London School of Economics]] on a Varvaressos scholarship from Athens University. He was a student [[syndicalist]] and activist in Athens<ref>He was elected as a member of the Administrative Council of the Law students Union in 1958-59, following the first victory of a Left alliance in which he participated against EKOF, an extreme right wing student association controlled by the 'deep' Greek state , which a few years later, in 1963, was responsible for the murder of Left parliamentarian Grigoris Lambrakis and 4 years later of the military coup which led to the military dictatorship (1967-74).</ref> and then a political activist in London, taking an active part in the [[1968 student protests]] in London, and in organisations of the revolutionary Greek Left during the struggle against the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]]. During this period, he was a member of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Groups]] in London, which published the newspaper ''\u039c\u03b1\u03bc\u03ae'' ("Midwife", from the Marxian dictum, "violence is the midwife of revolution"), for which he wrote several articles.<ref>As testified by the Left composer Lakis Karalis in an interview in the Athens newspaper Eleftherotypia (06/09/2008) and in an Arts web site [http://www.provoleas.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=758&Itemid=69 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2].</ref>\u000a\u000aFotopoulos is married since 1966 with Sia Mamareli (a former lawyer); they have a son, Costas, (born in 1974), he is a Composer and Pianist.\u000a\u000a==Academia and afterwards==\u000aHe was Senior Lecturer in Economics at the [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]] from 1969 to 1989, until he started editing the journal ''Society & Nature'', later ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and subsequently the online ''International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.<ref name=BioContinuum /><ref name=BioEIPCP /> He was also a columnist of ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'',<ref>{{gr icon}} [http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.search&t=0&q=&cat=&typ=&author=%CE%A6%CF%89%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82+%CE%A4%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%82&s=p Archive of Takis Fotopoulos' articles at the website of Eleftherotypia]</ref> the second-biggest newspaper in Greece.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Helena |last1=Smith |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/greek-election-blog-2012/2012/jun/12/greek-journalists-unpaid-newspaper-edition |title=Greek journalists return to work unpaid for what may be paper's last edition |journal=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 June 2012}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Inclusive Democracy==\u000a{{Libertarian socialism|People}}\u000a{{main article|Inclusive Democracy}}\u000aFotopoulos developed the political project of [[Inclusive Democracy]] (ID) in 1997 (an exposition can be found in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy''). The first issue of ''Society & Nature'' declared that:\u000a\u000a:"our ambition is to initiate an urgently needed dialogue on the crucial question of developing a new liberatory social project, at a moment in [[History]] when the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] has abandoned this traditional role."<ref>[http://www.democracynature.org/vol9/editorial_3.htm Editorial]</ref>\u000a\u000aand specified that the new project should be seen as the outcome of a synthesis of the democratic, libertarian socialist and [[Green anarchism|radical Green]] traditions.<ref>[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/our_aims.htm Our Aims] @ Society and Nature/Democracy and Nature's website</ref> Since then, a dialogue has followed in the pages of the journal, in which supporters of the [[automony]] project like [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[social ecology]] supporters including its founder [[Murray Bookchin]], and Green activists and academics like [[Steven Best]] have taken part.\u000a\u000aThe starting point for Fotopoulos' work is that the world faces a multi-dimensional crisis (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political) which is caused by the concentration of power in elites, as a result of the market economy, representative democracy and related forms of hierarchical structure. An inclusive democracy, which involves the equal distribution of power at all levels, is seen not as a utopia (in the negative sense of the word) or a "vision" but as perhaps the only way out of the present crisis, with trends towards its creation manifesting themselves today in many parts of the world. Fotopoulos is in favor of [[market abolitionism]], although he would not identify himself as a market abolitionist as such because he considers market abolition as one aspect of an inclusive democracy which refers only to the [[economic democracy]] component of it. He proposes a model of economic democracy for a stateless, marketless and moneyless economy but he considers that the economic democracy component is equally significant to the other components of ID, i.e. political or [[direct democracy]], economic democracy, ecological democracy and democracy in the social realm. Fotopoulos' work has been critically assessed by important activists, theorists and scholars.<ref name="book review"/><ref>Jorge Camil, review of Hacia Una Democracia Inclusiva (in Spanish), La Jornada, Friday, 8 June 2001.</ref><ref>Arran Gare, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 34 (1), Winter 2002, p. 97-99.</ref><ref>Michael Levin, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, [[Anarchist Studies]], Vol. 5,  No. 2, October 1997.</ref><ref>John Griffin, Dodgy Logic and the Olympians, Total Liberty, 1999-2000, p. 10-11.</ref><ref>James Herod, review of Towards an Inclusive Democracy, [http://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf Getting Free: Creating an Association of Democratic Autonomous Neighborhoods], [[Lucy Parsons Center]] (first printing edition), May 2007.</ref>\u000a\u000a== Selected Bibliography ==\u000a{{cleanup list|section|date=August 2015}}\u000a\u000a===Original English===\u000a* ''[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/brtid.htm Towards An Inclusive Democracy.
