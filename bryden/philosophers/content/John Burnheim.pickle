V'''John Burnheim''' (born in 1927 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]])<ref>Sutherland, Keith [http://equalitybylot.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/john-burnheim-to-reason-why/ John Burnheim: To Reason Why] at Equality by Lot (Wordpress) blog, 30 June 2011. (It will be seen that John Burnheim is a respondent to the blog.) Accessed 24 October 2013</ref> is a former [[professor]] of General [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]].\u000a\u000aIn his book [[Is Democracy Possible? The alternative to electoral politics]] (1985) Burnheim used the term "[[demarchy]]" (created by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his [[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]) to describe a political system without the [[Sovereign state|state]] or bureaucracies, and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers. This has striking resemblances to classical democratic ideas, as reported by [[Thucydides]]. In 2006 Burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that "a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authority".<ref name=burnpref >Burnheim J. ''Is Democracy Possible?'' [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/pubotbin/toccer-new?id=burisde.xml&data=/usr/ot/&tag=democracy&part=front Preface to the second edition] At SETIS (Sydney University) (2006)</ref>\u000a\u000aDemarchy as Burnheim conceives it has two features that distinguish it from other proposals for selection by lot in politics.\u000a\u000aFirst, an insistence on putting distinct policy areas under mutually independent authorities which would settle problems of coordination  between them by negotiation or arbitration rather than by dictation from above. The point of this is to remedy the defect of existing democracies in which issues are settled according to the power strategies of politicians rather than the merits of the case.\u000a\u000aSecond that the committee in charge of each policy body should be statistically representative of those who are most substantially affected by their decisions. The hope is that this would lead to better decisions, not just the wishful thinking of populist spin.\u000a \u000aBurnheim used to be a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]<ref name=stove >Stove D.
