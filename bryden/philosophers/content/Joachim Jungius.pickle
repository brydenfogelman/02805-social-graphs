He studied [[metaphysics]] at the Universities of [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[University of Giessen|Giessen]], where in 1608 he earned his degree.\u000a\u000aBeginning in 1609, he was a professor of mathematics at the University of [[Giessen]], and in 1614&ndash;15, with [[Wolfgang Ratke]] (1571&ndash;1635) and [[Christoph Helvig]] (1581&ndash;1617), he took part in studies of [[educational reform]]. In 1616, he returned to [[Rostock]] in order to study medicine, later obtaining his medical doctorate from the [[University of Padua]] (1619). From 1619 to 1623, he practiced medicine in Lübeck. In 1622 at Rostock, he founded an early scientific society known as ''Societas Ereunetica sive Zetetica''.\u000a\u000aFrom 1624 to 1628, Jungius worked as a professor of mathematics at Rostock, his service here being briefly interrupted in 1625, when he spent time as professor of medicine at the [[University of Helmstedt]]. From 1629 until 1657, he was professor of [[natural sciences]] at the ''Akademisches Gymnasium'', a secondary school in [[Hamburg]]. Jungius believed that science was based on mathematics, and at Hamburg stressed the importance of [[critical thinking]] to his students. He also felt that mathematics and [[logic]] served as a remedy to [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and mystical speculation.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a\u000aJungius was an important figure of 17th century [[atomism]], and was an advocate of a "[[Corpuscularianism|corpuscular chemistry]]" that assumed the [[conservation of mass]]. He also demonstrated that a [[catenary]] was not a [[parabola]].\u000a\u000aIn 1638 he published the textbook ''Logica Hamburgensis'', which presented late [[medieval]] theories and techniques of [[logic]]. Here he demonstrated oblique cases of arguments that did not adhere to simpler forms of [[inference]]; An example being: "The square of an even number is even; 6 is even; therefore, the square of 6 is even". His double position as connected to scholastic logic, but also to innovations, earns him the classification [[Semi-Ramist]].<ref>Donald Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'' (2006), p. 178.</ref>\u000a\u000a[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] wrote,\u000a\u000a:"While Jungius of Lübeck is a man little known even in Germany itself, he was clearly of such judiciousness and such capacity of mind that I know of no other mortal, including even [[Descartes]] himself, from whom we could better have expected a great restoration of the sciences, had Jungius been either known or assisted."<ref>''Preface to a Universal Characteristic'', (1678-79), in Ariew & Garber, (1989), p. 7.</ref>\u000a\u000a== Citations ==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a\u000a=== Editions ===\u000a* Joachim Jungius, 1957.
