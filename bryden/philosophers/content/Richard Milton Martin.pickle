V{{Other people|Richard Martin}}\u000a'''Richard Milton Martin''' (1916, [[Cleveland, Ohio]] &ndash; 22 November 1985, [[Milton, Massachusetts]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[logician]] and analytic [[philosopher]]. In his Ph.D. thesis written under [[Frederic Brenton Fitch|Frederic Fitch]], Martin discovered virtual sets a bit before [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], and was possibly the first non-Pole other than [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] to employ a [[mereology|mereological]] system. Building on these and other devices, Martin forged a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]] capable of expressing its own [[syntax]] as well as some [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] (via an [[event logic]]), all while abstaining from [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and [[model theory]] (consistent with his [[nominalist]] principles), and from [[intension]]al notions such as [[modal logic|modality]].\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aMartin was educated as follows:\u000a* B.A. [[Harvard]], philosophy, 1941;\u000a* M.A. [[Columbia University|Columbia]], 1941;\u000a* Ph.D. [[Yale]], philosophy, 1952.\u000aMartin studied under [[Alfred North Whitehead]], then in his last year at Harvard, and may have studied under [[Ernest Nagel]] at Columbia.\u000a\u000aDuring WWII, Martin taught mathematics at [[Princeton University]], then at the [[University of Chicago]]. After the war, he taught philosophy at [[Bryn Mawr College]] 1946&ndash;48, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Penn) 1948&ndash;59, the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] 1959&ndash;63, [[New York University]] 1963&ndash;73, Northwestern 1973&ndash;76 (full-time) and 1976&ndash;85 (one course per year). Martin also held visiting appointments at Bonn, Yale, Hamburg, the New School, and Temple.\u000a\u000aIn 1976, Martin largely retired from teaching, becoming a research associate with [[Boston University]]\u2019s Center for the History and Philosophy of Science. He made excellent use of the resulting leisure, so that his final decade of life was by far his most productive, publishing over 100 book chapters and journal articles.  In 1979, he published the definitive treatment of his logic / first-order theory, Part A of ''Semiotics'', and edited a volume of [[Carolyn Eisele]]\u2019s writings on [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. He helped edit the [[Festschrift]] books for Fitch and [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]], respectively, published in 1975 and 1985.\u000a\u000aAt the time of his death, Martin served on the editorial board of eight journals and on the advisory board of the Peirce Edition Project. In 1981, he became president of the Charles S. Peirce Society. In 1984, he was elected president of the Metaphysical Society of America.\u000a\u000aDespite having held tenure track appointments from 1948 until his death, the only Ph.D. thesis known to have been completed under Martin\u2019s supervision is that of James Scoggin. Otherwise, Martin\u2019s legacy is coextensive with his published writings.\u000a\u000a== Ideas ==\u000a"\u2026one of the most many-sided, prolific, and scholarly of analytic philosophers."\u000a:&mdash;Hans Burkhardt, Foreword to ''Metaphysical''.\u000a\u000aMartin was part of the first wave of American analytic philosophers; arguably, only Quine (1908&ndash;2000), Fitch (1909&ndash;1987), and [[Henry Leonard (philosopher)|Henry Leonard]] (1905&ndash;67) preceded him. His chronological elders [[Nelson Goodman]] (1906&ndash;1998) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1912&ndash;89) were arguably his contemporaries, as they all began their careers in earnest at about the same time, namely right after WWII. Martin's formal treatment of syntax followed [[Alfred Tarski]]; of semantics, [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Martin was generally well-disposed towards Carnap's work, contributed a long paper to the Schilpp volume on Carnap, and was seen as a disciple. Paradoxically, Martin was a [[positivism|positivist]] and radical [[nominalism|nominalist]] who also sympathized with [[process theology]] and orthodox [[Christianity]].\u000a\u000aBetween 1943 and 1992, Martin published 16 books and about 240 papers (of which 179 were included in his books) on an extraordinary range of subjects, including [[aesthetics]], logic, the [[foundation of mathematics]], [[metaphysics]], [[syntax]]/[[semantics]]/[[pragmatics]], the [[philosophy of science]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[process philosophy]], [[theology]], [[Frege]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Martin preached and practiced that philosophy should be done formally, by employing first-order logic, the theory of [[virtual set]]s and [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], and a multiplicity of [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s, all culminating in an [[event logic]]. Starting with the papers reprinted in his 1969 ''Belief'', Martin argued that the Frege's ''Art des Gegebensein'' was crucial to his thinking. Just what this ''Art'' entailed remains to be elucidated.\u000a\u000aMartin was especially fond of applying his first-order theory to the analysis of ordinary language, a method he termed ''logico-linguistics''. He often referenced the work of the linguists [[Zellig Harris]] (admiringly) and [[Henry Hiz]] (more critically); Martin, Harris, and Hiz all taught at Penn in the 1950s. Yet Martin was dismissive of the related theoretical work by [[Noam Chomsky]] and his MIT colleagues and students. Ironically, Martin appears to have been Chomsky's main teacher of logic; while a student at Penn, Chomsky took every course Martin taught.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meguire|first=Philip|title=Richard Milton Martin: American Logician|journal=The Review of Modern Logic|date=September 2004 \u2013 February 2005|volume=10|issue=31|pages= 7\u201365|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rml/1203432181|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000aQuine's ''[[Word and Object]]'' cites Martin with approval, but Martin's wider impact has not been commensurate with the breadth and depth of his writings; the secondary literature on Martin consists of little more than reviews of his books.
