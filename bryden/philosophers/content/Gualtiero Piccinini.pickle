He is Professor in the Philosophy Department and the Center for Neurodynamics at the [[University of Missouri, St. Louis]], United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ |title=Gualtiero Piccinini's Homepage |publisher=University of Missouri |location=St. Louis |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Background==\u000aPiccinini was born and raised in Italy, and studied [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive science]] at the [[University of Turin]]. He then went to graduate school at [[University of Pittsburgh]], specializing in philosophy of science.<ref>[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Official Website]</ref> Upon completion of his Ph.D. he held a postdoctoral position at the PNP program at Washington University, St. Louis, devoted to Philosophy, Neuroscience and Psychology. He started his position at University of Missouri, St. Louis in 2005 and received early tenure and promotion to associate professor in 2010 and early promotion to full professor in 2014.<ref>[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Piccinini's website]</ref> From 2011 to 2014 he was the Chair of the Philosophy Department at University of Missouri, St. Louis.<ref>[http://www.umsl.edu/~philo/People/Faculty/index.html List of Faculty, Department of Philosophy UMSL]</ref>\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000a\u000a===Cognitive science===\u000aIn the area of [[cognitive science]] Piccinini is best known for his [[Computation#Physical phenomenon|mechanistic account of what it takes for a physical system to perform computations]].  He has argued that computation is a kind of mechanistic process that does not require [[mental representation|representation]].<ref>Nir Fresco (2008). "An Analysis of the Criteria for Evaluating Adequate Theories of Computation." Minds and Machines 18 (3).</ref>  Building on his account of computation, he and co-author Sonya Bahar, an award-winning physicist and Director of the Center for Neurodynamics at University of Missouri, St. Louis, argue that neural computations are neither digital nor analog, but sui generis.<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/is-the-brain-computer Kristian Marlow (2012).
