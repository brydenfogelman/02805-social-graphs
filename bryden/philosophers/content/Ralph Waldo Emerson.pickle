He was seen as a champion of [[individualism]] and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States.\u000a\u000aEmerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, "[[Nature (Emerson)|Nature]]". Following this ground-breaking work, he gave a speech entitled "[[The American Scholar]]" in 1837, which [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]] considered to be America's "Intellectual Declaration of Independence".<ref name="Richardson, 263">Richardson, 263</ref> \u000a\u000aEmerson wrote most of [[Essays (Emerson)|his important essays]] as lectures first, then revised them for print. His first two collections of essays ''[[Essays: First Series]]'' and ''[[Essays: Second Series]]'', published respectively in 1841 and 1844\u2014represent the core of his thinking, and include such well-known essays as "[[Self-Reliance]]", "[[Over-soul|The Over-Soul]]", "[[Circles (Ralph Waldo Emerson)|Circles]]", "[[The Poet (Ralph Waldo Emerson)|The Poet]]" and "[[Experience (Emerson)|Experience]]". Together with "Nature", these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson's most fertile period.\u000a\u000aEmerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical [[wikt:tenet|tenets]], but developing certain ideas such as [[Individualism|individuality]], [[Liberty|freedom]], the ability for humankind to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson's "nature" was more philosophical than [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]]: "Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul". Emerson is one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."<ref>{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |year = 2007 |ISBN = 0415939267 |page = 310 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aHe remains among the [[linchpin]]s of the American romantic movement,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsbsX2eycI0C&pg=PR21&lpg=PR21&dq=Emerson+-+linchpin|title=The Emerson Dilemma|publisher=|accessdate=2015-06-29}}</ref> and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that have followed him.

He first went to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], but found the weather was still too cold.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], 72</ref> He then went further south, to [[St. Augustine, Florida]], where he took long walks on the beach and began writing poetry. While in St. Augustine he made the acquaintance of [[Prince Achille Murat]]. Murat, the nephew of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], was only two years his senior; they became extremely good friends and enjoyed one another's company. The two engaged in enlightening discussions on religion, society, philosophy, and government, and Emerson considered Murat an important figure in his intellectual education.<ref>Field, Peter S., Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual, Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, ISBN 0-8476-8843-7, ISBN 978-0-8476-8843-2</ref>\u000a\u000aWhile in St. Augustine, Emerson had his first experience of [[slavery]]. At one point, he attended a meeting of the Bible Society while there was a slave auction taking place in the yard outside. He wrote, "One ear therefore heard the glad tidings of great joy, whilst the other was regaled with 'Going, gentlemen, going!' "<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], 76</ref>\u000a\u000a==Early career==\u000a[[File:Emerson3 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Engraved drawing, 1878]]\u000a\u000aAfter Harvard, Emerson assisted his brother William<ref>Richardson, 29</ref> in a school for young women<ref>McAleer, 66</ref> established in their mother's house, after he had established his own school in [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]]; when his brother William<ref>Richardson, 35</ref> went to [[Göttingen]] to study divinity, Emerson took charge of the school. Over the next several years, Emerson made his living as a schoolmaster, then went to [[Harvard Divinity School]]. Emerson's brother Edward,<ref>Richardson, 36\u201337</ref> two years younger than he, entered the office of lawyer [[Daniel Webster]], after graduating from Harvard first in his class. Edward's physical health began to deteriorate and he soon suffered a mental collapse as well; he was taken to McLean Asylum in June 1828 at age 23. Although he recovered his mental equilibrium, he died in 1834 from apparently longstanding [[tuberculosis]].<ref>Richardson, 37</ref> Another of Emerson's bright and promising younger brothers, Charles, born in 1808, died in 1836, also of tuberculosis,<ref>Richardson, 38\u201340</ref> making him the third young person in Emerson's innermost circle to die in a period of a few years.\u000a\u000aEmerson met his first wife, Ellen Louisa Tucker, in Concord, New Hampshire, on Christmas Day 1827, and married her when she was 18.<ref>Richardson, 92</ref> The couple moved to Boston, with Emerson's mother Ruth moving with them to help take care of Ellen, who was already sick with tuberculosis.<ref>McAleer, 105</ref> Less than two years later, Ellen died at the age of 20 on February 8, 1831, after uttering her last words: "I have not forgotten the peace and joy".<ref>Richardson, 108</ref> Emerson was heavily affected by her death and visited her grave in Roxbury daily.<ref>Richardson, 116</ref> In a journal entry dated March 29, 1832, Emerson wrote, "I visited Ellen's tomb & opened the coffin".<ref>Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Volume IV: 7</ref>\u000a\u000aBoston's [[Second Church, Boston|Second Church]] invited Emerson to serve as its junior pastor and he was ordained on January 11, 1829.<ref>Richardson, 88</ref> His initial salary was $1,200 a year, increasing to $1,400 in July,<ref>Richardson, 90</ref> but with his church role he took on other responsibilities: he was chaplain to the Massachusetts legislature, and a member of the Boston school committee. His church activities kept him busy, though during this period, facing the imminent death of his wife, he began to doubt his own beliefs.\u000a\u000aAfter his wife's death, he began to disagree with the church's methods, writing in his journal in June 1832: "I have sometimes thought that, in order to be a good minister, it was necessary to leave the ministry. The profession is antiquated. In an altered age, we worship in the dead forms of our forefathers".<ref>Sullivan, 6</ref> His disagreements with church officials over the administration of the [[Eucharist|Communion]] service and misgivings about public prayer eventually led to his resignation in 1832. As he wrote, "This mode of commemorating Christ is not suitable to me. That is reason enough why I should abandon it".<ref>Packer, 39</ref><ref>Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Uncollected prose'', [http://www.emersoncentral.com/lordsupper.htm The Lord's Supper], 9 September 1832</ref> As one Emerson scholar has pointed out, "Doffing the decent black of the pastor, he was free to choose the gown of the lecturer and teacher, of the thinker not confined within the limits of an institution or a tradition".<ref>Ferguson, Alfred R. "Introduction to The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Volume IV". Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 1964: xi.</ref>\u000a\u000aEmerson toured Europe in 1833 and later wrote of his travels in ''English Traits'' (1856).<ref>McAleer, 132</ref> He left aboard the brig ''Jasper'' on Christmas Day, 1832, sailing first to Malta.<ref>Baker, 23</ref> During his European trip, he spent several months in Italy, visiting Rome, Florence and Venice, among other cities. When in Rome, he met with [[John Stuart Mill]], who gave him a letter of recommendation to meet [[Thomas Carlyle]]. He went to Switzerland, and had to be dragged by fellow passengers to visit [[Voltaire]]'s home in Ferney, "protesting all the way upon the unworthiness of his memory".<ref>Richardson, 138\u2013</ref> He then went on to Paris, a "loud modern New York of a place",<ref>Richardson, 138</ref> where he visited the [[Jardin des Plantes]]. He was greatly moved by the organization of plants according to [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|Jussieu]]'s system of classification, and the way all such objects were related and connected. As Richardson says, "Emerson's moment of insight into the interconnectedness of things in the Jardin des Plantes was a moment of almost visionary intensity that pointed him away from theology and toward science".<ref>Richardson, 143</ref>\u000a\u000aMoving north to England, Emerson met [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle in particular was a strong influence on Emerson; Emerson would later serve as an unofficial literary agent in the United States for Carlyle, and in March 1835, he tried to convince Carlyle to come to America to lecture.<ref>Richardson, 200</ref> The two would maintain correspondence until Carlyle's death in 1881.<ref>[[#Packer|Packer]], 40.</ref>\u000a[[File:Daguerreotype Lydia Jackson Emerson and Edward Waldo Emerson 1840.jpeg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of [[Lidian Jackson Emerson]] and son [[Edward Waldo Emerson]] ca 1850]]\u000a\u000aEmerson returned to the United States on October 9, 1833, and lived with his mother in Newton, Massachusetts, until October, 1834, when he moved to [[Concord, Massachusetts]], to live with his step-grandfather Dr. [[Ezra Ripley]] at what was later named [[The Old Manse]].<ref>Richardson, 182</ref> Seeing the budding Lyceum movement, which provided lectures on all sorts of topics, Emerson saw a possible career as a lecturer. On November 5, 1833, he made the first of what would eventually be some 1,500 lectures, discussing The Uses of Natural History in Boston. This was an expanded account of his experience in Paris.<ref>Richardson, 154</ref> In this lecture, he set out some of his important beliefs and the ideas he would later develop in his first published essay Nature:\u000a\u000a{{quote|Nature is a language and every new fact one learns is a new word; but it is not a language taken to pieces and dead in the dictionary, but the language put together into a most significant and universal sense.

Its first official meeting was held on September 19, 1836.<ref>Baker, 53</ref> On September 1, 1837, women attended a meeting of the Transcendental Club for the first time.

A year later, on August 31, 1837, Emerson delivered his now-famous [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] address, "[[The American Scholar]]",<ref>Sullivan, 13</ref> then known as "An Oration, Delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge"; it was renamed for a collection of essays (which included the first general publication of "Nature") in 1849.<ref>Buell, 45</ref> Friends urged him to publish the talk, and he did so, at his own expense, in an edition of 500 copies, which sold out in a month.<ref name="Richardson, 263"/>  In the speech, Emerson declared literary independence in the United States and urged Americans to create a writing style all their own and free from Europe.<ref>Watson, Peter.

Though they had likely met as early as 1835, in the fall of 1837, Emerson asked Thoreau, "Do you keep a journal?" The question went on to be a lifelong inspiration for Thoreau.<ref name=Buell121>Buell, 121</ref> Emerson's own journal comes to 16 large volumes, in the definitive Harvard University Press edition published between 1960 and 1982.

This was the first time he managed a lecture series on his own, and was the beginning of his serious career as a lecturer.<ref>Richardson, 257</ref> The profits from this series of lectures were much larger than when he was paid by an organization to talk, and Emerson continued to manage his own lectures often throughout his lifetime. He would eventually give as many as 80 lectures a year, traveling across the northern part of the United States. He traveled as far as St. Louis, Des Moines, Minneapolis, and California.<ref>Richardson, 418\u2013422</ref>\u000a\u000aOn July 15, 1838,<ref>Packer, 73</ref> Emerson was invited to [[Divinity Hall, Harvard Divinity School]] for the school's graduation address, which came to be known as his "[[Divinity School Address]]". Emerson discounted biblical miracles and proclaimed that, while Jesus was a great man, he was not God: historical Christianity, he said, had turned Jesus into a "demigod, as the Orientals or the Greeks would describe Osiris or Apollo".<ref name=Buell161>Buell, 161</ref> His comments outraged the establishment and the general Protestant community. For this, he was denounced as an [[atheism|atheist]],<ref name=Buell161/> and a poisoner of young men's minds. Despite the roar of critics, he made no reply, leaving others to put forward a defense.

"Their whole doctrine is spiritual", he wrote, "but they always end with saying, Give us much land and money".<ref name=Packer150>Packer, 150</ref> Even Alcott admitted he was not prepared for the difficulty in operating Fruitlands.

This collection included "The Poet", "Experience", "Gifts", and an essay entitled "Nature", a different work from the 1836 essay of the same name.\u000a\u000aEmerson made a living as a popular lecturer in [[New England]] and much of the rest of the country. He had begun lecturing in 1833; by the 1850s he was giving as many as 80 per year.<ref>Richardson, 418</ref> He addressed the [[Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]] and the [[Gloucester Lyceum]], among others. Emerson spoke on a wide variety of subjects and many of his essays grew out of his lectures. He charged between $10 and $50 for each appearance, bringing him as much as $2,000 in a typical winter "season". This was more than his earnings from other sources. In some years, he earned as much as $900 for a series of six lectures, and in another, for a winter series of talks in Boston, he netted $1,600.<ref>Emerson as Lecturer, R. Jackson Wilson, in ''The Cambridge Companion to Ralph Waldo Emerson'', Cambridge University Press, 1999</ref> He eventually gave some 1,500 lectures in his lifetime. His earnings allowed him to expand his property, buying {{convert|11|acre|m2}} of land by [[Walden Pond]] and a few more acres in a neighboring pine grove.

Clarence Gohdes (New York, 1932), p. 57</ref>\u000a\u000aEmerson did not become an ardent abolitionist until 1844, though his journals show he was concerned with slavery beginning in his youth, even dreaming about helping to free slaves. In June 1856, shortly after Charles Sumner, a United States Senator, was beaten for his staunch abolitionist views, Emerson lamented that he himself was not as committed to the cause. He wrote, "There are men who as soon as they are born take a bee-line to the axe of the inquisitor. . . . Wonderful the way in which we are saved by this unfailing supply of the moral element".<ref name=McAleer531>McAleer, 531</ref> After Sumner's attack, Emerson began to speak out about slavery. "I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom", he said at a meeting at Concord that summer.<ref>Packer, 232</ref> Emerson used slavery as an example of a human injustice, especially in his role as a minister. In early 1838, provoked by the murder of an abolitionist publisher from [[Alton, Illinois]] named [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]], Emerson gave his first public antislavery address. As he said, "It is but the other day that the brave Lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free speech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live".<ref name=McAleer531/> [[John Quincy Adams]] said the mob-murder of Lovejoy "sent a shock as of any earthquake throughout this continent".<ref>Richardson, 269</ref> However, Emerson maintained that reform would be achieved through moral agreement rather than by militant action. By August 1, 1844, at a lecture in Concord, he stated more clearly his support for the abolitionist movement. He stated, "We are indebted mainly to this movement, and to the continuers of it, for the popular discussion of every point of practical ethics".<ref>{{cite book | last=Lowance | first=Mason | title=Against Slavery: An Abolitionist Reader | pages=301\u2013302 | publisher=Penguin Classics | year=2000 | isbn=0-14-043758-4}}</ref>\u000a\u000aEmerson is often known as one of the most [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] thinkers of his time who believed that through the democratic process, slavery should be abolished.

"Emerson, Slavery, And Citizenship." Raritan 28.2 (2008): 127-146.</ref> Much of his early life, he was silent on the topic of race and slavery.

I saw ten, twenty, a hundred large lipped, lowbrowed black men in the streets who, except in the mere matter of language, did not exceed the sagacity of the elephant.

Gilman. The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

But this belief in racial inferiorities did not make Emerson a supporter of slavery.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Emerson wrote later that year that, "No ingenious sophistry can ever reconcile the unperverted mind to the pardon of Slavery; nothing but tremendous familiarity, and the bias of private interest".<ref name="Emerson, Ralph Waldo 1982"/> Emerson saw the removal of people from their homeland, the treatment of slaves, and the self-seeking benefactors of slaves as gross injustices.<ref name="Turner, Jack 2008"/> For Emerson, slavery was a moral issue while superiority of the races was an issue Emerson tried to analyze from a scientific perspective based what he believe to be inherited traits.<ref name="Finseth, Ian 2005">Finseth, Ian. "Evolution, Cosmopolitanism, And Emerson's Antislavery Politics." American Literature 77.4 (2005): 729-760.</ref>\u000a\u000aEmerson saw himself as a man of Saxon descent. In a speech given in 1835 titled "Permanent Traits of the English National Genius", Emerson said the following, "The inhabitants of the United States, especially of the Northern portion, are descended from the people of England and have inherited the traits of their national character".<ref name="Painter, Nell Irvin 2009">Painter, Nell Irvin. "Ralph Waldo Emerson's Saxons." Journal Of American History 95.4 (2009): 977-985.</ref> Emerson saw direct ties between race based on national identity and the inherit nature of the human being.<ref name="Painter, Nell Irvin 2009"/> White Americans who were native-born in the United States, Emerson categorizes this population as its own "race", had a unique position of being superior to other members of the nations.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Emerson's idea of race was more based on a shared culture, environment, and history, not the scientific traits that modern science defines as race. He believed that native-born Americans of English descent were superior to European immigrants, such as the Irish, French, and German.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>\u000a\u000aLater in his life, Emerson's ideas on race changed when he became more involved in the abolitionist movement while at the same time he began to more thoroughly analyze the philosophical implications of race and racial hierarchies. His beliefs shifted focus to the potential outcomes of racial conflicts. Emerson's racial views were closely related to his views on nationalism and national superiority, specifically that of the Saxons. Emerson used contemporary theories of race and natural science to support a theory of race development.<ref name="Finseth, Ian 2005"/> He believed that the current political battle and the current enslavement of other races was an inevitable racial struggle, one that would result in the inevitable union of the United States. Such conflicts were necessary for the dialectic of change that would eventually allow the progress of the nation.<ref name="Finseth, Ian 2005"/> In much of his later work, Emerson seems to allow the notion that different races will eventually mix in America. This hybridization process would lead to a superior race that would be to the advantage of the superiority of the United States. (Field 9). It is unclear whether or not Emerson believed that Africans would be involved in this hybridization, since much of his work on race seems to indicate that he believed in an early "survival of the fittest" interpretation of Darwin, in which less superior races would eventually become obsolete.<ref name="Painter, Nell Irvin 2009"/>\u000a\u000aEmerson was a supporter of the spread of community libraries in the nineteenth century, having this to say of them:\u000a\u000aConsider what you have in the smallest chosen library.

In ''The Western Canon'', Harold Bloom compares Emerson to [[Michel de Montaigne]]: "The only equivalent reading experience that I know is to reread endlessly in the notebooks and journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American version of Montaigne."<ref>Bloom, Harold.
