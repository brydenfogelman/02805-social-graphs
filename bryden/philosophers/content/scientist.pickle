In a more restricted sense, a scientist may refer to an individual who uses the [[scientific method]].<ref>[[Isaac Newton]] (1687, 1713, 1726).

Scientists perform research toward a more comprehensive understanding of [[nature]], including physical, mathematical and social realms.\u000a\u000a[[Philosophy]] is a distinct activity that is not generally considered science. [[Philosophers]] aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of intangible aspects of reality and experience that cannot be physically measured.\u000a\u000aScientists are also distinct from [[engineer]]s, those who design, build, and maintain devices for particular situations; however, no engineer attains that title without significant study of science and the scientific method. When science is done with a goal toward practical utility, it is called [[applied science]]. An applied scientist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is conducting research with the aim of developing new technologies and practical methods. When science is done with an inclusion of intangible aspects of reality it is called ''[[natural philosophy]]''.\u000a\u000a==Description==\u000a[[Science]] and [[technology]] have continually modified [[human]] existence through the engineering process. As a profession the scientist of today is widely recognized. Scientists include [[Scientific theory|theoreticians]] who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results, and [[experiment]]alists who mainly test models by making measurements \u2014 though in practice the division between these activities is not clear-cut, and many scientists perform both tasks.\u000a\u000a[[Jurisprudence]] and [[mathematics]] are often grouped with the sciences. Some of the greatest [[physics|physicists]] have also been creative mathematicians and lawyers.{{examples|date=April 2016}} There is a continuum from the most theoretical to the most [[empiricism|empirical]] scientists with no distinct boundaries. In terms of [[personality psychology|personality]], interests, training and [[profession]]al activity, there is little difference between [[applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]] and [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]].\u000a\u000aScientists can be motivated in several ways. Many have a desire to understand why the [[world]] is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about [[reality]]. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige, or the desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, the nations, the world, nature or industries (academic scientist and [[industrial scientist]]). Scientists tend to be less motivated by direct financial reward for their work than other careers. As a result, scientific researchers often accept lower average salaries when compared with many other professions which require a similar amount of training and qualification.<ref>http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-2269520/Best-paid-jobs-2012-Official-figures-national-average-UK-salaries-400-occupations.html</ref>\u000a\u000a==Demography==\u000a\u000a=== By country ===\u000aThe number of scientists is vastly different from country to country.

The number of science and engineering doctorates awarded to women rose from a mere 7 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 1985 and in engineering alone the numbers of bachelor's degrees awarded to women rose from only 385 in 1975 to more than 11000 in 1985.<ref>{{cite book | title = Women's Science: Learning and Succeeding from the Margins | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 |author = Margaret A.

According to Eisenhart and Finked, women's experiences, even when they have equal qualifications, are that they start in lower positions while men are granted tenure track positions. This later predicts a gender inequality of tenured positions as scientists in universities, "as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions." Income conflicts occur when median annual salaries for full-time employed civilian scientists are compared, "salary for men is $48,000, and that for women is $42,000."<ref>Eisenhart and Finkel, Ch 1 in The Gender and Science Reader ed.

Ross added a comment that this "some ingenious gentleman" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p.72.</ref> Whewell's suggestion of the term was partly satirical, a response to changing conceptions of science itself in which natural knowledge was increasingly seen as distinct from other forms of knowledge.  Whewell wrote of "an increasing proclivity of separation and dismemberment" in the sciences; while highly specific terms proliferated\u2014chemist, mathematician, naturalist\u2014the broad term "philosopher" was no longer satisfactory to group together those who pursued science, without the caveats of "natural" or "experimental" philosopher.  Members of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] had been complaining about the lack of a good term at recent meetings, Whewell reported in his review; alluding to himself, he noted that "some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with ''artist'', they might form [the word] ''scientist'', and added that there could be no scruple in making free with this term since we already have such words as ''[[economist]]'', and ''[[atheist]]''\u2014but this was not generally palatable".<ref name=Holmes>{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |year= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}</ref>\u000a\u000aWhewell proposed the word again more seriously (and not anonymously) in his 1840<ref name=Whewell>{{cite book |last1=Whewell|first=William|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences Volume 1|publisher=John W Parker J&J Deighton|location=Cambridge|page=cxiii}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fe8TAAAAQAAJ].

Scientists of different eras (and before them, natural philosophers, mathematicians, natural historians, natural theologians, engineers, and others who contributed to the development of science) have had widely different places in society, and the [[social norms]], [[ethical values]], and [[epistemic virtues]] associated with scientists\u2014and expected of them\u2014have changed over time as well.  Accordingly, many different historical figures can be identified as early scientists, depending on which elements of modern science are taken to be essential.\u000a\u000aSome historians point to the 17th century as the period when science in a recognizably modern form developed (what is popularly called the [[Scientific Revolution]]). It wasn't until the 19th century that sufficient socioeconomic changes occurred for scientists to emerge as a major profession.<ref>On the historical development of the character of scientists and the predecessors, see: Steven Shapin (2008).

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] contributions to science\u2014including works of geometry and mathematical astronomy, early accounts of biological processes and catalogs of plants and animals, and theories of knowledge and learning\u2014were produced by [[philosopher]]s and [[physician]]s, as well as practitioners of various trades.  These roles, and their associations with scientific knowledge, spread with the [[Roman Empire]] and, with the [[History of Christianity#Church of the Roman Empire (313\u2013476)|spread of Christianity]], became closely linked to religious institutions in most of European countries. [[Astrology]] and [[astronomy]] became an important area of knowledge, and the role of astronomer/astrologer developed with the support of political and religious [[patronage]].  By the time of the [[medieval university]] system, knowledge was divided into the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]''\u2014philosophy, including [[natural philosophy]]\u2014and the ''[[quadrivium]]''\u2014mathematics, including astronomy.  Hence, the medieval analogs of scientists were often either philosophers or mathematicians. Knowledge of plants and animals was broadly the province of physicians.\u000a\u000a[[Science in medieval Islam]] generated some new modes of developing natural knowledge, although still within the bounds of existing social roles such as philosopher and mathematician. Many proto-scientists from the [[Islamic Golden Age]] are considered polymaths, in part because of the lack of anything corresponding to modern [[scientific discipline]]s. Many of these early polymaths were also religious [[priest]]s and [[Theology|theologians]]: for example, [[Alhazen]] and [[Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b|al-Biruni]] were [[Kalam|mutakallimiin]]; the physician [[Avicenna]] was a [[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]]; the physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] was a hafiz, [[muhaddith]] and [[ulema]]; the botanist [[Otto Brunfels]] was a theologian and historian of Protestantism; the astronomer and physician [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was a priest.

He discovered that a charge applied to the spinal cord of a frog could generate muscular spasms throughout its body. Charges could make frog legs jump even if the legs were no longer attached to a frog. While cutting a frog leg, Galvani's steel scalpel touched a brass hook that was holding the leg in place. The leg twitched. Further experiments confirmed this effect, and Galvani was convinced that he was seeing the effects of what he called animal electricity, the life force within the muscles of the frog.
