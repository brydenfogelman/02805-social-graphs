Wollheim served as the president of the [[British Society of Aesthetics]] from 1992 onwards until his death in 2003.\u000a\u000aSon of an actress and a theatre impresario, Wollheim attended [[Westminster School]], London, and [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1941\u20132, 1945\u20138), interrupted by active military service in World War&nbsp;II.<ref>For his own account of his service in Europe during the war, see Wollheim, "Fifty Years On", ''London Review of Books'' 23 (23 Je 1994): 3\u20136. \u000a</ref> In 1949 he obtained a congratulatory first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, and began teaching at [[University College London]], where he became [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of Mind and Logic]] and Department Head from 1963 to 1982. He was visiting professor at Harvard University, Columbia University, the University of Minnesota, Graduate Center, CUNY, the University of California-Berkeley, UC Davis and elsewhere. He chaired the Department at UC Berkeley, 1998\u20132002. On retirement from Berkeley, he served briefly as a guest lecturer at Balliol College. Wollheim gave several distinguished lecture series, most notably the Andrew M. Mellon lectures in Fine Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1984), published as ''Painting as an Art''.\u000a\u000aIn 1962, he published an article "A paradox in the theory of democracy",<ref>In "Philosophy, Politics and Society", edited by Peter Laslett and W.G. Runciman, published by Basil Blackwell, 1962. Pp. 71-87.</ref> in which Wollheim argued that a supporter of democracy faces a contradiction when he votes. On the one hand he wants a particular party or candidate to win, but on the other hand he wants whoever wins the most votes to win. This has become known as [[Wollheim's paradox]].\u000a\u000aHis ''Art and its Objects'' was one of the twentieth century's most influential texts on philosophical [[aesthetics]] in English. In a 1965 essay, '[[Minimal Art]]', he seems to have coined the phrase, although its meaning eventually drifted from his. As well as for his work on the philosophy of art, Wollheim was known for his philosophical treatments of [[depth psychology]], especially [[Sigmund Freud]]'s.<ref>He was also Ernest Jones Lecturer at the Institute of Psychoanalysis in London in 1968.</ref> His posthumously-published autobiography of youth, ''Germs: A Memoir of Childhood'',<ref>[http://waywiser-press.com/wollheim.html For excerpts from eighteen reviews, see]</ref> with complementary essays, discloses a good deal about his family background and his life up to early manhood, providing valuable material for understanding his interests and sensibility.\u000a\u000a==Publications==\u000aFor an extensive bibliography of Richard Wollheim's publications by a professional bibliographer, see Eddie Yeghiayan's UC-Irvine site.<ref>[http://www.lib.uci.edu/about/publications/hri/index.html?page=wollheim Richard Wollheim Bibliography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> See also the 'Philweb' listing.<ref>[http://www.phillwebb.net/History/TwentiethCentury/Analytic/Recent/Wollheim/Wollheim.htm Richard Wollheim<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\u000a\u000aNote: given his unique mind, personality, and distinctive writing styles, along with his curiosity and sociability, many of Richard Wollheim's publications are outside academic categories. Besides books, he published many articles, in journals and edited collections, book reviews, and gallery catalogues for shows. He also left writings in manuscript, letters and recordings of his talks.\u000a\u000a;Books and separately published works (selected)\u000a*''F. H. Bradley''.
