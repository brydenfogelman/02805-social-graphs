V'''William Thomas Valerio Fontaine''' (born '''William Thomas Fontaine'''; December 2, 1909&nbsp;&ndash; December 29, 1968) was an [[United States|American]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. Teaching at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1947 to 1967, he was an American Professor of philosophy in the [[Ivy League]].\u000a\u000a== Early life and career ==\u000aFontaine was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pennsylvania]], an industrial town southwest of [[Philadelphia]]. His father worked in a steel mill on the [[Delaware River]]. Enrolling in [[Chester High School (Chester, Pennsylvania)|Chester High School]] at age twelve, he graduated in the top third of his class. After Fontaine\u2019s parents died in the 1930s, his aunt raised his younger siblings and funded their continued education.\u000a\u000aIn 1926 Fontaine enrolled in [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], a school about thirty miles west of Chester. He wrote poems and analytic essays for the school newspaper, in which he argued that African Americans needed to show \u201cability, aggressiveness, and cooperation\u201d to succeed. He graduated first in his class in 1930.\u000a\u000aOver the next six years, Fontaine taught Latin, history and government at Lincoln. He also pursued an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Philosophy from the nearby University of Pennsylvania, which he earned in 1932. He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Philosophy from Penn in 1936.\u000a\u000aHe worked as a professor of philosophy and history at [[Southern University]] in Louisiana from 1936 to 1942. Fontaine married an acquaintance from Philadelphia in 1936, Willabelle Hatton of Iva, S.C.,two children Jean and Vivian.\u000a\u000aFontaine returned to Penn in 1943 and audited graduate courses until 1946. Drafted during [[World War II]], Fontaine worked at [[Fort Holabird|Holabird Signal Depot]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. He taught basic education to illiterate soldiers.\u000a\u000aFontaine joined the Penn faculty in 1947 as a [[lecturer]] and was promoted to Assistant Professor two years later.\u000a\u000a==Philosophy==\u000aInfluenced by [[emotivism|emotivist]] philosopher [[Charles Leslie Stevenson|C. L. Stevenson]], Fontaine called his own position a \u201cmodified ethical [[relativism]].\u201d When a group desired a certain state of affairs, he argued, it might alter the attitudes fundamental to its ethical stance. For example, politicians offered employment to blacks during [[World War I]] not in order to achieve occupational racial equality, but to avert defeat by Germany. Blacks may not have been as interested in the latter, but they certainly were in the better jobs.\u000a\u000a==Political views==\u000aRaised in an unusually [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] household in Chester, Fontaine was a strong supporter of the [[New Deal]]. During the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] and later [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]] eras, Fontaine supported the presidential candidacy of socially liberal [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Governor of Minnesota|governor]] [[Harold Stassen]], who served as President of Penn from 1948 to 1953.\u000a \u000aFontaine was considerably more opposed to [[Communism]] than even to the [[racism]] in some Western democracies. As a result, he became a liberal [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] during the [[Cold War]]. He supported Presidents Truman, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] in their anti-Communist agendas. At the same time, he strongly supported the growing [[Civil Rights Movement (1955\u20131968)|Civil Rights]] movement.\u000a\u000aFontaine expounded his civil rights views in ''Reflections on Segregation, Desegregation, Power, and Morals'', published in 1967. While he supported racial equality, he argued that the growing [[Black Power]] movement contained the same intellectual defects that existed in white racism, in that it sought preferential treatment for blacks and the non-participation of whites in black life. Considered too unfocused by contemporaries, the text received no reviews until 40 years after its publication.\u000a\u000a==Later life, travels, and Penn career==\u000aFontaine was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1949. After working only one half-time and two years of medical leave, he returned to his normal Penn position in 1955. He received an assistant professorship in 1956, tenure in 1957, and an associate professorship in 1963.\u000a\u000aInterested in growing [[African nationalism]] in the era of [[decolonization]], Fontaine traveled worldwide to discuss [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] issues. In 1959, he attended [[Pope John XXIII]]\u2019s address of thanks to those who promoted black culture. The next year, he traveled to [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], where he celebrated the inauguration of his classmate, [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] as [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor General]]. Two years later, as secretary of the [[American Society of African Culture]], he attended a conference on [[socialism]] called by [[Senegal]]ese [[List of Presidents of Senegal|President]] [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]].\u000a\u000aWith the worsening of his tuberculosis, Fontaine finished ''Reflections'' in 1967 and went on indefinite medical leave. After being confined to an apartment for over a year, he died on December 29, 1968.\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[American philosophy]]\u000a*[[List of American philosophers]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Cite book\u000a  | last = Kuklick\u000a  | first = Bruce\u000a  | author-link = \u000a  | last2 = \u000a  | first2 = \u000a  | author2-link = \u000a  | title = Black Philosopher, White Academy: The Career of William Fontaine\u000a  | place = Philadelphia\u000a  | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press\u000a  | year = 2008\u000a  | volume = \u000a  | edition = \u000a  | url = \u000a  | doi = \u000a  | id = \u000a  | isbn = 978-0-8122-4098-6\u000a  | postscript = <!--None-->}}\u000a\u000a{{cite web|last=Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=DR.
