Baumgartner Obituary |publisher=Rand-wilson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>\u000a\u000aBaumgartner was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], began his undergraduate study at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1960, then transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from which he received his PhD in 1970 from  for a dissertation entitled ''Results and Independence Proofs in Combinatorial Set Theory''. His advisor was [[Robert Vaught]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=22587}}</ref>\u000aHe became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1969, and there spent his entire career.\u000a\u000aOne of Baumgartner's results is the consistency of the statement that any two <math>\u005caleph_1</math>-dense sets of reals are order isomorphic (a set of reals is <math>\u005caleph_1</math>-dense if it has exactly <math>\u005caleph_1</math> points in every open interval). With [[András Hajnal]] he proved the result ([[Baumgartner\u2013Hajnal theorem]]) that the [[partition relation]] <math>\u005comega_1\u005cto(\u005calpha)^2_n</math> holds for <math>\u005calpha<\u005comega_1,n<\u005comega</math>. He died of a heart attack in 2011.<ref>[http://rand-wilson.com/obituaries/obit_view.php?id=26]</ref>\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a\u000a*[[Baumgartner's axiom]]\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000a* Baumgartner, James E., ''A new class of order types'', Annals of Mathematical Logic, 9:187\u2013222, 1976\u000a* Baumgartner, James E., ''Ineffability properties of cardinals I'', Infinite and Finite Sets, Keszthely (Hungary) 1973, volume 10 of Colloquia Mathematica Societatis János Bolyai, pages 109\u2013130.
