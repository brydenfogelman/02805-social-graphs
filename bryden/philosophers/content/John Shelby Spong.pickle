From 1979 to 2000 he was [[Episcopal Diocese of Newark|Bishop of Newark]] (based in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]]). He is a [[liberal Christian]] [[Theology|theologian]], religion commentator and author. He calls for a fundamental rethinking of Christian belief away from [[theism]] and traditional doctrines.<ref name=ABC1>[http://www.abc.net.au/sundaynights/stories/s1238959.htm Interview.] ABC Radio Australia, June 17, 2001</ref>\u000a\u000a==Background==\u000aSpong was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], and educated in Charlotte public schools. He attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1952. He received his Master of Divinity degree in 1955 from the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]] in 1955. He has had honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees conferred on him by Virginia Theological Seminary and [[Saint Paul's College, Virginia]], as well as an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters conferred by [[Muhlenberg College]] in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aIn 2005, he wrote: "[I have] immerse[d] myself in contemporary Biblical scholarship at such places as Union Theological Seminary in New York City, [[Yale Divinity School]], [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the storied universities in [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]."<ref>John Shelby Spong, ''The Sins of Scripture'', HarperCollins 2005, page xi</ref>\u000a\u000aSpong served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[St. Joseph's Episcopal Church (Durham, North Carolina)|St. Joseph's Church]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], from 1955 to 1957; rector of Calvary Parish, [[Tarboro, North Carolina]], from 1957 to 1965; rector of [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lynchburg|St. John's Church]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], from 1965 to 1969; and rector of [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church of Richmond, Virginia|St. Paul's Church]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], from 1969 to 1976.

In a 2013 interview, Spong credits the late Anglican bishop [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]] as his mentor in this journey and says that reading Robinson's controversial writings in the 1960s led to a friendship and mentoring relationship with him over many years.<ref>[http://www.readthespirit.com/explore/the-retired-bishop-john-shelby-spong-interview-on-one-of-the-worlds-most-loved-and-feared-books-the-bibles-gospel-of-john/ "The retired Bishop John Shelby Spong interview"], Read the Spirit website, 23 June 2013.</ref> Spong also honors Robinson as a mentor in the opening pages of his 2002 book ''[[A New Christianity for a New World]]''.\u000a\u000a[[Image:Bishop John Shelby Spong speaking 2006.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Spong during [[CrossWalk America]], 2006]]\u000a\u000aRecipient of many awards, including 1999 Humanist of the Year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://churchofhumanism.org/en/content/section/8/30/ |title=The Humanist Foundation |publisher=Churchofhumanism.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23}}\u000a</ref> Spong is a contributor to the [[Living the Questions]] DVD program and has been a guest on numerous national television broadcasts (including ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with Bill Maher, ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[Larry King Live]]'').

He is representative of a stream of thought with roots in the [[medieval]] [[universalism]] of [[Peter Abelard]] and the [[existentialism]] of [[Paul Tillich]], whom he has called his favorite theologian.<ref>"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153507,00.html Challenging the 'Sins of Scripture']". Interview with [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]. April 14, 2005.</ref>\u000a\u000aA prominent theme in Spong's writing is that the popular and literal interpretations of Christian scripture are not sustainable and do not speak honestly to the situation of modern Christian communities. He believes in a more nuanced approach to scripture, informed by scholarship and compassion, which can be consistent with both Christian tradition and contemporary understandings of the universe. He believes that [[theism]] has lost credibility as a valid conception of [[God]]'s nature. He states that he is a Christian because he believes that [[Jesus]] Christ fully expressed the presence of a God of compassion and selfless love and that this is the meaning of the early Christian proclamation, "Jesus is Lord" (Spong, 1994 and Spong, 1991). Elaborating on this last idea he affirms that Jesus was adopted by God as his son,  (Born of a Woman 1992), and he says that this would be the way God was fully incarnated in Jesus Christ.<ref name=ABC1/>  He rejects the historical truth claims of some Christian doctrines, such as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]] (Spong, 1992) and the bodily [[resurrection of Jesus]] (Spong, 1994). In 2000, Spong was a critic of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', because it reaffirmed the Catholic doctrine that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the [[one true faith|one true Church]] and, perhaps even more importantly, that Jesus Christ is the one and only [[salvation|savior]] for humanity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shelby |first=John |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/2000/11/Dominus-Iesus-The-Voice-Of-Rigor-Mortis.aspx |title=Dominus Iesus: The Voice of Rigor Mortis |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref>\u000a\u000aSpong has also been a strong proponent of the church reflecting the changes in society at large.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/opinion/15kristof.html Liberal Bible-Thumping] The New York Times, May 15, 2005</ref> Towards these ends, he calls for a new [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], in which many of Christianity's basic doctrines should be reformulated.<ref name=ABC1/>\u000a\u000aHis views on the future of Christianity are, "...that we have to start where we are. As I look at the history of religion, I observe that new religious insights always and only emerge out of the old traditions as they begin to die. It is not by pitching the old insights out but by journeying deeply through them into new visions that we are able to change religion\u2019s direction. The creeds were 3rd and 4th century love songs that people composed to sing to their understanding of God. We do not have to literalize their words to perceive their meaning or their intention to join in the singing of their creedal song. I think religion in general and Christianity in particular must always be evolving. Forcing the evolution is the dialogue between yesterday\u2019s words and today\u2019s knowledge. The sin of Christianity is that any of us ever claimed that we had somehow captured eternal truth in the forms we had created."<ref>Q & A for 2-14-2013 \u2013 electronic newsletter, A New Christianity For a New World, http://johnshelbyspong.com/</ref>\u000a\u000aSpong has debated Christian philosopher and apologist [[William Lane Craig]] on the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\u000a\u000aAccording to The Episcopal Diocese of Newark, Bishop Spong suffered a stroke before a speaking engagement in Marquette, Michigan on Saturday, Sept 10, 2016.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/dionewark/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE&fref=nf</ref>\u000a\u000a=="Points for Reform" of Christianity==\u000a{{Copypaste|url=https://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/the-fourth-r/a-call-for-a-new-reformation/|date=July 2016}}\u000aSpong's "Twelve Points for Reform" were originally published in ''The Voice'', the newsletter of the Diocese of Newark, in 1998.<ref>[https://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/the-fourth-r/a-call-for-a-new-reformation/ A Call for a New Reformation]</ref> Spong elaborates on them in his book ''A New Christianity for a New World'':\u000a# [[Theism]], as a way of defining God, is dead. So most theological God-talk is today meaningless. A new way to speak of God must be found.\u000a# Since God can no longer be conceived in theistic terms, it becomes nonsensical to seek to understand Jesus as the incarnation of the theistic deity. So the [[Christology]] of the ages is bankrupt.\u000a# The Biblical story of the perfect and finished creation from which human beings fell into sin is pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] mythology and post-Darwinian nonsense.\u000a# The [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], understood as literal biology, makes Christ's divinity, as traditionally understood, impossible.\u000a# The miracle stories of the [[New Testament]] can no longer be interpreted in a post-[[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] world as [[supernatural]] events performed by an incarnate deity.\u000a# The view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of God and must be dismissed.\u000a# Resurrection is an action of God. Jesus was raised into the meaning of God. It therefore cannot be a physical resuscitation occurring inside human history.\u000a# The story of the [[Entering Heaven alive|Ascension]] assumed a three-tiered universe and is therefore not capable of being translated into the concepts of a post-[[Copernicus|Copernican]] space age.\u000a# There is no external, objective, revealed standard written in scripture or on tablets of stone that will govern our ethical behavior for all time.\u000a# Prayer cannot be a request made to a theistic deity to act in human history in a particular way.\u000a# The hope for [[Afterlife|life after death]] must be separated forever from the behavior control mentality of reward and punishment. The Church must abandon, therefore, its reliance on guilt as a motivator of behavior.\u000a# All human beings bear God's image and must be respected for what each person is. Therefore, no external description of one's being, whether based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]] or [[sexual orientation]], can properly be used as the basis for either rejection or discrimination.\u000a\u000a==Criticism==\u000aSpong acknowledges that his writings evoke great support and great condemnation simultaneously from differing segments of the Christian church.<ref>Spong, John Shelby (2000) ''Here I Stand: My Struggle for a Christianity of Integrity, Love and Equality'' (Harper Collins), pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\u000a\u000aSpong's ideas have been criticized by some other theologians, notably in 1998 by [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Bishop of Monmouth]],  who later became the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Williams described Spong's Twelve Points for Reform as embodying "confusion and misinterpretation".<ref name=Williams>{{Cite journal|title=No life, here \u2013 no joy, terror or tears |journal=Church Times |date=1998-07-17 |first=Rowan |last=Williams |coauthors= |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=Anglican Ecumenical Society |id= |url=http://anglicanecumenicalsociety.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/bishop-spong-and-archbishop-williamss-response/ }}</ref>\u000a\u000aDuring a speaking tour in Australia in 2001, Spong was banned by [[Peter Hollingworth]], the [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Archbishop of Brisbane]], from speaking at churches in the diocese. The tour coincided with Hollingworth leaving the diocese to become the Governor-General of Australia. Hollingworth said that it was not an appropriate moment for Spong to "engage congregations in matters that could prove theologically controversial".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s318287.htm|date=25 Jun 2001|title=Anglican Church snubs Bishop|accessdate=5 Jan 2016|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/07/anglicanism|date=7 Jul 2001|title=Fear of ideas: The decline and fall of Anglicanism|accessdate=5 Jan 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> After Spong's book ''Jesus for the Non-Religious'' was published in 2007, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]], the [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney|Archbishop of Sydney]], banned Spong from preaching at any churches in his diocese.
