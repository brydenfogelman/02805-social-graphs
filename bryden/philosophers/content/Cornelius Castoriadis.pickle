He writes:\u000a<blockquote> ...psychoanalysis can and should make a basic contribution to a politics of autonomy. For, each person's self-understanding is a necessary condition for autonomy. One cannot have an autonomous society that would fail to turn back upon itself, that would not interrogate itself about its motives, its reasons for acting, its deep-seated [''profondes''] tendencies. Considered in concrete terms, however, society doesn't exist outside the individuals making it up. The self-reflective activity of an autonomous society depends essentially upon the self-reflective activity of the humans who form that society.<ref>''FT'' A: "Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads" (essay based on a speech given in [[Abrantes]] in November 1996), p. 151.

Rather, by reforming education and political systems, individuals would be increasingly capable of critical self- and social reflexion.

Change emerges through ''the [[imaginary (sociology)#Castoriadis|social imaginary]]'' without strict determinations, but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as [[revolution]]. Any knowledge of society and [[social change]] can exist only by referring to (or by positing) ''social imaginary [[Verstehen|significations]]''. Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of [[modernity]] centered on the principal categories of ''[[social institution]]s'' and social imaginary significations;<ref name="IIS 160"/> in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the ''radical [[imagination]]'' and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former.<ref>Marcela Tova, [http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/815/81500904.pdf "The imaginary term in readings about modernity: Taylor and Castoriadis conceptions"], ''Revista de Estudios Sociales'' 9, June 2001, pp. 32\u201339.</ref> (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of ''the radical [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)#The Imaginary and French culture|imaginary]]'' can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.)<ref>''IIS'', p. 373.</ref><ref>Chiara Bottici, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Au0YBQAAQBAJ&dq= ''Imaginal Politics: Images Beyond Imagination and the Imaginary''], Columbia University Press, 2014, p. 50.</ref><ref>[[:fr:Nicolas Poirier|Nicolas Poirier]], [http://www.cairn.info/revue-du-mauss-2003-1-page-383.htm "Cornelius Castoriadis.

Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, it is helpful to understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.\u000a\u000a=== Autonomy and heteronomy ===\u000a{{Libertarian socialism|People}}\u000aThe concept of "[[autonomy]]" appears to be a key theme in his early postwar writings and he continued to elaborate on its meaning, applications and limits until his death, gaining him the title of "Philosopher of ''Autonomy''". The word itself is [[Greek language|Greek]], where ''auto-'' means 'for/by itself' and ''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'' means 'law,' defining the condition of creating one's own laws, whether as an individual or as a whole society. Castoriadis noticed that while all societies construct their own unique laws and institutions, members of ''autonomous societies'' are fully aware of this fact and explicitly self-institute.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castoriadis |first=Cornelius |authorlink= |author2=Anti-Mythes |date=January 1974 |title=An Interview with C. Castoriadis |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=23 |page=152}}</ref> In contrast, members of ''heteronomous societies'' (''hetero''- 'other') delegate this process to extra-social authorities and attribute their [[imaginary (Sociology)|imaginaries]] to gods or ancestors or, in modern ideologies, to historical necessity.<ref>"Alienation appears first of all as the alienation of a society to its institutions, as the ''autonomization'' of institutions in relation to society." (''IIS'', p. 115.)</ref>\u000a\u000aCastoriadis emphasized the need of societies to legitimize their laws or explain, in other words, why their laws are good and just as they claim them to be. Most traditional societies did that through religion, believing that their laws were given by a super-natural ancestor or god and therefore must be true. Modern capitalist societies legitimize their system ([[capitalism]]) through '[[reason]]', claiming it makes 'logical sense'.<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1999). « ''La rationalité du capitalisme'' » in ''Figures du Pensable'' (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' VI), Paris: Seuil.</ref> Castoriadis observes that nearly all such efforts are [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] in that they legitimize a system through rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament and the Koran claim that 'There is only one God, God', capitalism first defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of cost, and then bases its own legitimacy on its effectiveness to meet this criterion.\u000a\u000aAs he explains in one of his lectures in the Greek village of [[Leonidio]] in 1984,<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1984). ''\u0397 \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03a3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1''. Athens: Ypsilon (\u038e\u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd).</ref> many newly founded societies start from an autonomous state which is usually in the form of [[direct democracy]], like the [[Town meeting|town hall meetings]] during the [[American Revolution]] and the local assemblies of the [[Paris Commune]]. What they end up with, however, is a form of governance by which the citizens do not legislate directly but delegate this power to a group of experts who remain in power, largely unchecked by official means, for a number of years. The ancient Greeks on the other hand developed a system of continuous autonomy where the people (''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]'') voted constantly on matters of government and law and where the elected rulers, the ''[[Archon of Athens|archons]]'', were mainly asked to enforce them. In such a system, courts of law were governed by common citizens who were appointed to the degree of judge briefly and army generals were voted in by the people and had to convince them of the correctness of their decisions. Taking some poetic licence to expand this point, he says that in this system, the president of the national treasury could have been a Phoenician slave, since he would only be asked to implement the rulings of the demos.\u000a\u000aCastoriadis' writings delve at length into the philosophy and politics of the ancient Greeks who, as a true autonomous society knew that laws are man-made and legitimization tautological. They challenged these laws on a constant basis and yet obeyed them to the same degree (even to the extent of enforcing capital punishment) proving that autonomous societies can indeed exist.\u000a\u000a=== The Imaginary ===\u000aThe term "the Imaginary" originates in the writings of the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (see ''[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]'') and is strongly associated with Castoriadis' work. To understand it better we might think of its usual context, the "''imaginary institution of societies''". By that, Castoriadis means that societies, together with their laws and legalizations, are founded upon a basic conception of the world and man's place in it. Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries, expressed through various creation myths, by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason (as examined [[#Autonomy and heteronomy|above]]). That same imaginary is, interestingly enough, the foundation of its opposing ideology, [[Communism]]. By that measure he observes, first in his main criticism of [[Marxism]], titled the ''Imaginary Institution of Society'',<ref name ="IIS 23">''IIS'', p. 23.</ref> as well as speaking in Brussels,<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1981) (avec [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] et le Public de Louvain-la-Neuve), ''De l'écologie à l'autonomie'' [''From Ecology to Autonomy''], Édition de Seuil, Paris.</ref> that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought, since they share the same [[industrial revolution]] type imaginary: that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not, as he claimed, the main drive of social change, since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first.<ref name ="IIS 23" />\u000a\u000aSimilarly, in the issue of ecology he observes that the problems facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries. Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail, since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real, thus perpetuating the problem.\u000a\u000aThus, imaginaries are directly responsible for all aspects of culture. The Greeks had an imaginary by which the world stems from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and the ancient [[Jews]] an imaginary by which the world stems from the will of a pre-existing entity, God. The former developed therefore a system of immediate democracy where the laws were ever changing according to the people's will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God.\u000a\u000aCastoriadis also believed that the complex historical processes through which new imaginaries are born are not directly quantifiable by science. This is because it is through the imaginaries themselves that the categories upon which science is applied are created. In the second part of his ''Imaginary Institution of Society'' he gives the example of [[set theory]], which is at the basis of [[Mathematical logic|formal logic]], which cannot function without having first defined the "elements" which are to be assigned to sets.<ref>''IIS'', pp. 223\u20135.</ref> This initial ''schema of separation''<ref name="IIS 224\u20135"/> (''schéma de séparation'', \u03c3\u03c7\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd) of the world into distinct elements and categories therefore, precedes the application of (formal) logic and, consequently, science.\u000a\u000a=== Chaos ===\u000aThe concept of "Chaos" that one encounters frequently in Castoriadis' work.<ref>''IIS'', p. 46.</ref><ref>''FT'' B, p. 80.</ref> According to that, the Greeks developed an imaginary by which the world is a product of Chaos, as narrated by both [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The word has since been [[Chaos theory|promoted to a scientific term]], but Castoriadis is inclined to believe that although the Greeks ''had'' sometimes expressed Chaos in that way (as a system too complex to be understood), they mainly referred to it as ''nothingness''. He then concludes what made the ancient Greek society different to other societies is exactly that core imaginary, which essentially says that if the world is created out of nothing then man can indeed, in his brief time on earth, model it as he sees fit,<ref>Castoriadis advocated that "[t]he surging forth [''surgissement''] of signification\u2014of the institution, of society\u2014is creation and self-creation. ... Signification emerges to cover over the Chaos, thus bringing into being a mode of being that posits itself as negation of the Chaos" (''WIF'', p. 315).</ref> without trying to conform on some pre-existing order like a divine law. He contrasted that sharply to the Biblical imaginary, which sustains all Judaic societies to this day, according to which, in the beginning of the world there was a God, a willing entity and man's position therefore is to understand that Will and act accordingly.\u000a\u000a=== The Ancient Greeks and the Modern West ===\u000aCastoriadis views the political organization of the ancient Greek city states as a model of an autonomous society. He argues that their direct democracy was not based, as many assume, on the existence of slaves and/or the geography of Greece, which forced the creation of small city states, since many other societies had these preconditions but did not create democratic systems. The same goes for colonisation since the neighbouring [[Phoenicia]]ns, who had a similar expansion in the Mediterranean, were monarchical till their end. During this time of colonization, however, around the time of Homer's epic poems, we observe for the first time that the Greeks, instead of transferring their mother city's social system to the newly established colony, instead, for the first time in known history, legislate anew from the ground up. What also made the Greeks special was the fact that, following the above, they kept this system as a perpetual autonomy which led to direct democracy.\u000a\u000aThis phenomenon of autonomy is again present in the emergence of the states of northern Italy during the [[Renaissance]],<ref>See ''[[List of republics#Middle Ages and Renaissance|Renaissance republics]]''.</ref> again as a product of small independent merchants.\u000a\u000aHe sees a tension in the modern West between, on the one hand, the potentials for autonomy and creativity and the proliferation of "open societies" and, on the other hand, the spirit-crushing force of capitalism. These are respectively characterized as the ''creative imaginary'' and the ''capitalist imaginary'':\u000a<blockquote> I think that we are at a crossing in the roads of history, history in the grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its general orientation. That's the road of the loss of meaning, of the repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of "rational mastery," pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary. ¶ The other road should be opened: it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social and political awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary.<ref>''FT'' A: "Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads," p. 146.</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000aHe argues that, in the last two centuries, ideas about autonomy again come to the fore: "This extraordinary profusion reaches a sort of pinnacle during the two centuries stretching between 1750 and 1950. This is a very specific period because of the very great density of cultural creation but also because of its very strong\u000asubversiveness."<ref>''FT'' A: "Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads," p. 134.</ref>\u000a\u000a== Lasting influence ==\u000aCastoriadis has influenced European (especially continental) thought in important ways. His interventions in sociological and political theory have resulted in some of the most well-known writing to emerge from the continent (especially in the figure of [[Jürgen Habermas]], who often can be seen to be writing against Castoriadis).<ref>Elliott 2003, p. 101.</ref> Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis' work to a North American sociological audience,<ref>Joas, H. 1989. "Institutionalization as a Creative Process: The Sociological Importance of Cornelius Castoriadis's Political Philosophy", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. '''4''': 5 (March), 1184\u201399.</ref> and [[:cs:Johann Pál Arnason|Johann Pál Arnason]] has been of enduring importance both for his critical engagement with Castoriadis' thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public (especially during his editorship of the journal ''Thesis Eleven'').<ref>Arnason, J. P. 1989. "Culture and Imaginary Significations", ''Thesis Eleven'' 22, 25\u201345.</ref> In the last few years, there has been growing interest in Castoriadis's thought, including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students: Jeff Klooger's ''Castoriadis: Psyche, Society, Autonomy'' (Brill), and Suzi Adams's ''Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation'' (Fordham University Press).\u000a\u000a== Major publications ==\u000a;Original French\u000a* ''Mai 68 : la brèche'' [''The Breach''], [[Fayard]], 1968 (under the pseudonym Jean-Marc Coudray; co-authored with [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Claude Lefort]])\u000a* ''La Société bureaucratique'' [''Bureaucratic Society''] in two volumes: ''Les Rapports de production en Russie'' and ''La Révolution contre la bureaucratie'', 1973\u000a* ''L'Expérience du mouvement ouvrier'' [''The Experience of the Labor Movement''] in two volumes: ''Comment lutter'' and ''Prolétariat et organisation'', 1974\u000a* ''L'Institution imaginaire de la société'' [''The Imaginary Institution of Society''], [[Éditions du Seuil|Seuil]], 1975\u000a* ''Les Carrefours du labyrinthe'' [''Crossroads in the Labyrinth''], Volume I, 1978 \u000a* ''Le Contenu du socialisme'' [''On the Content of Socialism''], 1979<!--(translated in: ''PSW'', Vol. 1)-->\u000a* ''Capitalisme moderne et révolution'' [''Modern Capitalism and Revolution''] in two volumes, 1979\u000a* ''Devant la guerre'' [''Facing the War''], Volume I, 1981 (a second volume was never published)\u000a* ''Domaines de l'homme'' [''Domains of Man''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' II), 1986\u000a* ''La Brèche: vingt ans après'' (''réédition du livre de 1968 complété par de nouveaux textes'') [''The Breach: Twenty Years After''], 1988\u000a* ''Le Monde morcelé'' [''World in Fragments''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' III), 1990\u000a* ''La Montée de l'insignifiance'' [''The Rising Tide of Insignificance''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' IV), 1996\u000a* ''Fait et à faire'' [''Done and To Be Done''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' V), 1997\u000a\u000a;Posthumous publications\u000a* ''Figures du pensable'' [''Figures of the Thinkable''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' VI), 1999\u000a* ''Sur ''Le Politique'' de Platon'' [''Commentary on ''The Statesman'' of Plato''], 1999\u000a* ''Sujet et vérité dans le monde social-historique.
