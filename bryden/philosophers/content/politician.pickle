V{{politics}}\u000aA '''politician''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, "[[polis]]") is a person active in [[Political party|party]] [[politics]], or a person holding or seeking office in government.  In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office.  In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues.  Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government.<ref>{{Cite web|title = politician {{!}} someone who is active in government usually as an elected official|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politician|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref> Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.  Broadly speaking, a "politician" can be anyone who seeks to achieve [[political power]] in any [[bureaucratic]] institution.\u000a\u000a== Identity ==\u000aPoliticians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics.  Positions range from local offices to executive, legislative, and judicial offices of regional and national governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/politician |title=politician - Webster's New World College Dictionary |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordfind.com/word/politician/ |title=politician - Princeton Wordnet dictionary |publisher=wordfind.com }}</ref> Some elected law enforcement officers, such as [[sheriff]]s, are considered politicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaines, Miller|first=Larry, Roger LeRoy|title=Criminal Justice in Action|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-1111835576|page=152}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grant, Grant|first=Donald Lee, Jonathan|title=The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia|year=2001|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0820323299|page=449}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Media and rhetoric==\u000aPoliticians are known for their rhetoric, as in speeches or campaign advertisements. They are especially known for using common themes that allow them to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters.<ref>Jonathan Charteris-Black, ''Politicians and rhetoric: The persuasive power of metaphor'' (Palgrave-MacMillan, 2005)</ref> Politicians of necessity become expert users of the media.<ref>Ofer Feldman, ''Beyond public speech and symbols: Explorations in the rhetoric of politicians and the media'' (2000).</ref>  Politicians in the 19th century made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters.<ref>Robert J. Dinkin, ''Campaigning in America: A History of Election Practices'' (1989) [https://www.questia.com/library/1904945/campaigning-in-america-a-history-of-election-practices online]</ref> In the 20th century, they branched into radio and television, making television commercials the single most expensive part of an election campaign.<ref>Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Keith Spillette, ''The Press Effect: Politicians, Journalists, and the Stories that Shape the Political World'' (2014)</ref>  In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with the social media based on the Internet and smart phones.<ref>Nathaniel G.

Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side.<ref>Joel D. Aberbach,  Robert D. Putnam, and Bert A. Rockman, eds., '' Bureaucrats and politicians in western democracies'' (Harvard University Press, 1981)</ref> In patronage-based systems, such as the United States and Canada in the 19th century, winning politicians replace the bureaucracy with local politicians who formed their base of support, the "[[spoils system]]".  Civil service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of government services that were involved.<ref>David A. Schultz, and Robert Maranto, eds., ''The politics of civil service reform'' (1998).</ref>  However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today.<ref>Morris Szeftel, "Political graft and the spoils system in Zambia\u2014the state as a resource in itself." ''Review of African Political Economy'' 9.24 (1982): 4-21.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Careers==\u000aMattozzi and Merlo argue that there are two main career paths which are typically followed by politicians in modern democracies. First come the career politicians. They are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement. Second are the "political careerists". These are politicians who gain reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies, then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts.<ref>Andrea Mattozzi and Antonio Merlo, "Political careers or career politicians?." ''Journal of Public Economics'' 92#3 (2008): 597-608.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Characteristics==\u000aNumerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians, comparing those at the local and national levels, and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones, and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections.<ref>Timothy S. Prinz, "The career paths of elected politicians: a review and prospectus." in Shirley Williams and Edward L. Lascher, eds. ''Ambition and beyond: career paths of American politicians'' (1993) pp: 11-63.</ref>  In recent years, special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians.<ref>Elina Haavio-Mannila and Torild Skard, eds.

Chaney, ''Supermadre: Women in Politics in Latin America'' (University of Texas Press, 2014).</ref>\u000a\u000aMany politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents\u2014it is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player. United States Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] were renowned for their memories.<ref>{{cite book|author=Iwan W. Morgan|title=Assessing George W.

Gian Vittorio Caprara, Claudio Barbaranelli, Philip G. Zimbardo, 1997</ref>\u000a\u000a==Criticism==\u000aMany critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public. Areas of friction include the manner in which politicians speak, which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to "obscure, mislead, and confuse".<ref>Invitation to Critical Thinking - Page 319, Vincent E. Barry - 2007</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the popular image, politicians are thought of as clueless and [[corruption|corrupt]], taking money in exchange for goods or services, rather than working for the general public  good.<ref>Arnold J. Heidenheimer and Michael Johnston, eds. ''Political corruption: Concepts and contexts'' (2011).</ref>\u000a\u000aMany ex-politicians who could not bear the leadership in politics that causes reprisals for critical thought criticize those who remain politicians for lacking critical thought.<ref>Knapptryckarkompaniet, Anne-Marie Palsson, 2011</ref>\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a* [[American election campaigns in the 19th century]]\u000a* [[Midlothian campaign]] of 1878\u20131880 in Britain by one of its most famous politicians, [[William E.
