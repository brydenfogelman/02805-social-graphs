His book ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'' provided the underlying justification for political reforms in Spain under [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ppettit/tiempo.pdf |format=PDF |title=El maestro Pettit examina al alumno Zapatero |publisher=Princeton.edu |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>  Pettit detailed his relationship with Zapatero in his ''A Political Philosophy in Public Life: Civic Republicanism in Zapatero's Spain'', co-authored with José Luis Martí.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampereclub.org/Marti_Pettit_New%20Statesman.pdf |format=PDF |title=The reading list |publisher=Tampereclub.org |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>\u000a\u000aPettit holds that the lessons learned when thinking about problems in one area of philosophy often constitute ready-made solutions to problems faced in completely different areas.  Views he defends in philosophy of mind give rise to the solutions he offers to problems in metaphysics about the nature of free will, and to problems in the philosophy of the social sciences, and these in turn give rise to the solutions he provides to problems in moral philosophy and political philosophy. His corpus as a whole was the subject of a series of critical essays published in ''Common Minds: Themes from the Philosophy of Philip Pettit'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Mind/?view=usa&ci=9780199218165 |title=Common Minds - Geoffrey Brennan; Robert Goodin; Frank Jackson; Michael Smith - Oxford University Press |publisher=Oup.com |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Affiliations and honors==\u000a*Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2009)<ref>https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S24/02/44G04/index.xml</ref>\u000a*Honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (2010)<ref>https://www.ria.ie/news-(1)/royal-irish-academy-honours-top-academics.aspx</ref>\u000a*Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (2013)<ref>http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/index.cfm?member=24674</ref>\u000a*Fellow of the Australian academies in Humanities and Social Science\u000a*Member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS<ref>[http://www.fundacionideas.es/en/press_room/recent_news/2899 Fundacion IDEAS website], fundacionideas.es; accessed 13 March 2015. {{es icon}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Selected bibliography==\u000a\u000a===Books===\u000a*''The Concept of Structuralism: a Critical Analysis'' (1975)\u000a*''Judging justice: an introduction to contemporary political philosophy'' (1980)\u000a*''Rawls: 'A Theory of Justice' and its critics'' (1990) with [[Chandran Kukathas]]\u000a*''The Common Mind; an essay on psychology, society and politics'' (1993)\u000a*''Not Just Deserts.
