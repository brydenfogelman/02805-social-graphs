In [[set theory]], he discovered the notion of [[proper forcing axiom|proper forcing]], an important tool in iterated [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] arguments. With [[PCF theory]], he showed that in spite of the undecidability of the most basic questions of cardinal arithmetic (such as the [[continuum hypothesis]]), there are still highly nontrivial [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] theorems about [[cardinal number|cardinal]] exponentiation. Shelah constructed a [[Kurosh monster]], an uncountable group for which every proper subgroup is countable. He showed that [[Whitehead's problem]] is [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC|independent of ZFC]]. He gave the first [[primitive recursive]] upper bound to [[Van der Waerden's theorem|van der Waerden's numbers V(C,N)]].
