He was best known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]'' (1856). In both he analyzed the improved [[living standards]] and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. ''Democracy in America'' was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of [[sociology]] and [[political science]].\u000a\u000aTocqueville was active in French politics, first under the [[July Monarchy]] (1830\u201348) and then during the [[Second French Republic|Second Republic]] (1849\u201351) which succeeded the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|February 1848 Revolution]]. He retired from political life after [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon Bonaparte's]] [[French coup of 1851|2 December 1851 coup]], and thereafter began work on ''The Old Regime and the Revolution.''<ref name="Paul R Hansen 2009 p 3">Paul R. Hansen, ''Contesting the French Revolution'' (2009), p. 3.</ref>\u000a\u000aHe argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King [[Louis XIV]]. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] who advocated [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary government]], but he was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.<ref name="Paul R Hansen 2009 p 3"/>\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aAlexis de Tocqueville came from an old Norman aristocratic family with ancestors who participated in the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066. His parents, Hervé Louis François Jean Bonaventure Clérel, Comte de Tocqueville, an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King [[Louis XVI]], and Louise Madeleine Le Peletier de Rosanbo, barely escaped the [[guillotine]], because of the fall of [[Robespierre]] in 1794.\u000a\u000aAfter an exile in England, they returned to France during the reign of [[Napoleon]].

From 1839 to 1851, he served as deputy of the [[Manche|Manche department]] ([[Valognes]]). In parliament, he defended [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] views and upheld [[free trade]], while supporting the [[French rule in Algeria|colonisation of Algeria]] carried on by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]'s regime. Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of the Manche in 1842, and became the president of the department's {{lang|fr|''conseil général''}} between 1849 and 1851. According to one account, Tocqueville's political position became untenable during this time in the sense that he was mistrusted by both the left and right, and was looking for an excuse to leave France.<ref name=twsC11r44>{{cite news\u000a |author= Joshua Kaplan\u000a |title= Political Theory: The Classic Texts and their Continuing Relevance\u000a |publisher= The Modern Scholar\u000a |quote= 14 lectures; (lectures #11 & #12) \u2013 see disc 6\u000a |year= 2005\u000a}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Travels===\u000aIn 1831, he obtained from the July Monarchy a mission to examine prisons and penitentiaries in America, and proceeded there with his lifelong friend [[Gustave de Beaumont]]. While Tocqueville did visit some prisons, he traveled widely in America and took extensive notes about his observations and reflections.<ref name=twsC11r44/> He returned within nine months, and published a report, but the real result of his tour was ''[[De la démocratie en Amerique]]'', which appeared in 1835.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Tocqueville, Alexis Henri Charles Maurice Clerel, Comte de}}</ref> Beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in Jacksonian America: Marie or Slavery in the United States'' (1835).<ref>Gustave de Beaumont, [http://www.auxforgesdevulcain.fr/collections/litteratures/marie-ou-lesclavage-aux-etats-unis/ ''Marie ou l\u2019Esclavage aux États-Unis''.]</ref>\u000a\u000aApart from America, Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England, producing {{lang|fr|''Memoir on Pauperism''}}. In 1841 and 1846, he traveled to Algeria. His first travel inspired his {{lang|fr|''Travail sur l'Algérie''}}, in which he criticized the French model of [[colonialism|colonisation]], which was based on an [[assimilationist]] view, preferring instead the British model of [[indirect rule]], which avoided mixing different populations together. He went as far as openly advocating [[racial segregation]] between the European colonists and the [[Arabs]] through the implementation of two different legislative systems (a half century before implementation of the [[Indigénat|1881 Indigenous code]] based on religion).\u000a\u000aIn 1835, Tocqueville made a journey through Ireland. His observations provide one of the best pictures of how Ireland stood before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] (1845\u201349). The observations chronicle the growing Catholic middle-class and the appalling conditions in which most Catholic tenant farmers lived. Tocqueville made clear both his libertarian sympathies and his affinity for his Irish co-religionists.<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Journey in Ireland, July\u2013August 1835'', Catholic University of America Press, Washington, D.C, 1990.</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter the fall of the July Monarchy during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|February 1848 Revolution]], Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, where he became a member of the Commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848\u201351). He defended [[bicameralism]] (the wisdom of two parliamentary chambers) and the election of the President of the Republic by [[universal suffrage]]. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of Paris, universal suffrage was conceived as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of Paris.\u000a\u000aDuring the Second Republic, Tocqueville sided with the ''[[parti de l'Ordre]]'' against the socialists. A few days after the February insurrection, he believed that a violent clash between the Parisian workers' population led by socialists agitating in favor of a "Democratic and Social Republic" and the conservatives, which included the aristocracy and the rural population, was inescapable. As Tocqueville had foreseen, these social tensions eventually exploded during the [[June Days Uprising]] of 1848.<ref name="Paris, 1999">"Regularization" is a term used by Tocqueville himself, see {{lang|fr|''Souvenirs''}}, Third part, pp. 289\u201390 French edn (Paris, [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], 1999).</ref>\u000a\u000aLed by [[Louis Eugène Cavaignac|General Cavaignac]], the repression was supported by Tocqueville, who advocated the "regularization" of the [[state of siege]] declared by Cavaignac, and other measures promoting suspension of the constitutional order.<ref name="Paris, 1999"/>\u000aBetween May and September, Tocqueville participated in the Constitutional Commission which wrote the new Constitution.

There, during the troubled days of June 1849, he pleaded with [[Jules Armand Dufaure|Jules Dufaure]], Interior Minister, for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators. Tocqueville, who since February 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms, approved the two laws voted immediately after the June 1849 days, which restricted the liberty of clubs and [[freedom of the press]].<ref name="Tocqueville 2006">Joseph Epstein, ''Alexis De Tocqueville: Democracy's Guide'', HarperCollins Publishing, 2006, p. 148.</ref>\u000a\u000aThis active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in ''Democracy in America''. According to Tocqueville, he favored order as "the [[sine qua non]] for the conduct of serious politics. He [hoped] to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change.\u2033<ref name="Tocqueville 2006"/>\u000a\u000aTocqueville had supported Cavaignac against [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon Bonaparte]] for the presidential election of 1848. Opposed to Louis Napoléon's 2 December 1851 coup which followed his election, Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the [[10th arrondissement of Paris|10th arrondissement]] of Paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for "high treason", as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office. Detained at [[Vincennes]] and then released, Tocqueville, who supported the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] of the [[Bourbons]] against Napoleon III's [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] (1851\u201371), quit political life and retreated to his castle ({{lang|fr|''Château de Tocqueville''}}).<ref name="ReferenceA">Epstein, ''Alexis De Tocqueville: Democracy's Guide'' (2006), p. 160.</ref>\u000a\u000aAgainst this image of Tocqueville, biographer Joseph Epstein has concluded: "Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot. He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed \u2013 had given it, in all, thirteen years of his life [....] He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight, but conducting it now from libraries, archives, and his own desk."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> There, he began the draft of {{lang|fr|''L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution''}}, publishing the first tome in 1856, but leaving the second one unfinished.\u000a\u000a===Death (1859)===\u000aA longtime sufferer from bouts of [[tuberculosis]], Tocqueville would eventually succumb to the disease on 16 April 1859.

Observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist, Tocqueville wrote of his travels through America in the early 19th century when the [[Market Revolution|market revolution]], Western expansion, and [[Jacksonian democracy]] were radically transforming the fabric of American life.<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000aOne purpose of writing ''Democracy in America'', according to Joshua Kaplan, was to help the people of France get a better understanding of their position between a fading [[aristocracy|aristocratic order]] and an emerging [[democracy|democratic order]], and to help them sort out the confusion.<ref name=twsC11r44/> Tocqueville saw democracy as an equation that balanced [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]], concern for the individual as well as for the community.\u000a\u000aTocqueville was an ardent supporter of liberty. "I have a passionate love for liberty, law, and respect for rights", he wrote. "I am neither of the revolutionary party nor of the conservative....Liberty is my foremost passion." He wrote of "Political Consequences of the Social State of the Anglo-Americans" by saying: "But one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level, and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom".<ref>See Volume One, Part I, Chapter 3.</ref>\u000a\u000aHis view on government reflects his belief in liberty and the need for individuals to be able to act freely while respecting others' rights. Of centralized government, he wrote that it "excels in preventing, not doing."<ref>See Volume One, Part I, Chapter 5, George Lawrence translation.</ref>\u000a\u000aHe continues to comment on equality by saying: "Furthermore, when citizens are all almost equal, it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power. As none of them is strong enough to fight alone with advantage, the only guarantee of liberty is for everyone to combine forces. But such a combination is not always in evidence."<ref>[[Wikiquote:Alexis de Tocqueville]].</ref>\u000a\u000aThe above is often misquoted as a slavery quote because of previous translations of the French text. The most recent translation from Arthur Goldhammer in 2004 translates the meaning to be as stated above. Examples of misquoted sources are numerous on the internet;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notable-quotes.com/s/slavery_quotes.html |title=Slavery Quotes |publisher=Notable-quotes.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref> the text does not contain the words "Americans were so enamored by equality" anywhere.\u000a\u000aTocqueville explicitly cites inequality as being incentive for poor to become rich, and notes that it is not often that two generations within a family maintain success, and that it is [[inheritance|inheritance laws]] that split and eventually break apart someone's estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and rich, thereby over generations making the poor rich and rich poor. He cites protective laws in France at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs, thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in 1835 within the United States of America.\u000a\u000a===On civil and political society and the individual===\u000aTocqueville's main purpose was to analyze the functioning of political society and various forms of political associations, although he brought some reflections on civil society too (and relations between political and civil society). For Tocqueville as for [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]], civil society was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by [[civil code]].<ref name=zaleski>{{Cite journal\u000a  | last = Zaleski\u000a  | first = Pawel\u000a  | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society.

It originates as much from defects of intelligence as from the mistakes of the heart. Egoism blights the seeds of every virtue; individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue. In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ethikapolitika.org/2014/01/06/refuting-tocqueville-way-tocqueville/ |title= Refuting Tocqueville by Way of Tocqueville |author= [[Daniel Schwindt]] |date= January 2014 |work= |publisher= [[Ethika Politika]] |accessdate= 2016-08-24}}</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000a===On democracy and new forms of tyranny===\u000aTocqueville warned that modern democracy may be adept at inventing new forms of tyranny, because radical equality could lead to the materialism of an expanding bourgeoisie and to the selfishness of individualism. In such conditions we lose interest in the future of our descendents...and meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/05/17/100517crbo_books_woodWoods, James, "Tocqueville In America"], ''The New Yorker'', 17 May 2010.</ref> Tocqueville worried that if [[despotism]] were to take root in a modern democracy, it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the Roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time.<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000aIn contrast, a despotism under a democracy could see "a multitude of men", uniformly alike, equal, "constantly circling for petty pleasures", unaware of fellow citizens, and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an "immense protective power".<ref name=twsC11r44/> Tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens (children) as "perpetual children", and which doesn't break men's wills but rather guides it, and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a "flock of timid animals".<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000a===On the US social contract===\u000aTocqueville's penetrating analysis sought to understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried to understand why the US was so different from Europe in the last throes of [[aristocracy]]. The US, in contrast to the aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market [[capitalism]] had taken root to an extraordinary degree.\u000a\u000aTocqueville writes: "Among a democratic people, where there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living.... Labor is held in honor; the prejudice is not against but in its favor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper/DETOC/ch2_18.htm |title=Tocqueville: Book II Chapter 18 |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref>\u000a\u000a[[File:Alexis de Tocqueville.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alexis de Tocqueville]]\u000aTocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished [[primogeniture]] and [[Fee tail|entails]], resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation.<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000aIn the US, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of [[primogeniture]], which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall.<ref name=twsC11r44/> It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern.<ref name=twsC11r44/> Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living.\u000a\u000aThis rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to "middling" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.\u000a\u000aDespite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished the US and determined its mores and values also explained why the US masses held elites in such contempt.\u000a\u000a===On majority rule and mediocrity===\u000aBeyond the eradication of old-world aristocracy, ordinary Americans also refused to defer to those possessing, as Tocqueville put it, superior talent and intelligence, and these natural elites could not enjoy much share in political power as a result. Ordinary Americans enjoyed too much power, claimed too great a voice in the public sphere, to defer to intellectual superiors. This culture promoted a relatively pronounced equality, Tocqueville argued, but the same mores and opinions that ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity. Those who possessed true virtue and talent were left with limited choices.<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000aTocqueville said that those with the most education and intelligence were left with two choices. They could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society, or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector. Tocqueville wrote that he did not know of any country where there was "less independence of mind, and true freedom of discussion, than in America".<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000aHe blamed the omnipotence of [[majority rule]] as a chief factor in stifling thinking: "The majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence. A writer is free inside that area, but woe to the man who goes beyond it, not that he stands in fear of an inquisition, but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution. A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys."<ref name=twsC11r44/> Tocqueville, in contrast to previous political thinkers, argued that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong, but that people were "too weak" and felt powerless; the danger is that people felt "swept up in something that they could not control", according to Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville.<ref name=twsC11r44/>\u000a\u000a===On US slavery, Blacks and Indians===\u000aUniquely positioned at a crossroads in American history, Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America'' attempted to capture the essence of American culture and values. Though a supporter of colonialism, Tocqueville could clearly perceive the evils that Blacks and Indians had been subjected to in America. Tocqueville devoted the last chapter of the first volume of ''Democracy in America'' to the question while his travel companion, Gustave de Beaumont, wholly focused on slavery and its fallouts for the American nation in ''Marie or Slavery in America''. Tocqueville notes that among the races that exist in America:\u000a{{Quote|The first who attracts the eye, the first in enlightenment, in power and in happiness, is the white man, the European, man par excellence; below him appear the Negro and the Indian. These two unfortunate races have neither birth, nor face, nor language, nor mores in common; only their misfortunes look alike. Both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit; both experience the effects of tyranny; and if their miseries are different, they can accuse the same author for them.<ref>Beginning of chapter 18 of ''Democracy in America'', "The Present and Probably Future Condition of the Three Races that Inhabit the Territory of the United States".</ref> <!-- what edition, whose translation? -->}}\u000a\u000aTocqueville contrasted the settlers of Virginia with the middle-class, religious Puritans who founded New England, and analyzed the debasing influence of slavery:{{Quote|The men sent to Virginia were seekers of gold, adventurers without resources and without character, whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony. ... Artisans and agriculturalists arrived afterwards...hardly in any respect above the level of the inferior classes in England. No lofty views, no spiritual conception presided over the foundation of these new settlements. The colony was scarcely established when slavery was introduced; this was the capital fact which was to exercise an immense influence on the character, the laws and the whole future of the South. Slavery...dishonors labor; it introduces idleness into society, and with idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury and distress. It enervates the powers of the mind and benumbs the activity of man. On this same English foundation there developed in the North very different characteristics.<ref>''[[Democracy in America]]'', Vintage Books, 1945, pp. 31\u201332.</ref>}}\u000a\u000aTocqueville concluded that removal of the Negro population from America could not resolve the problem as he writes at the end of the first Democracy:\u000a{{Quote|If the colony of [[Liberia]] were able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the Negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union were to supply the society with annual subsidies, and to transport the Negroes to Africa in government vessels, it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population among the blacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born upon its territory within that time, it could not prevent the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the states. The Negro race will never leave those shores of the American continent to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of Europeans; and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it continues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may retard the calamities which they apprehend, but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause.}}\u000a\u000aIn 1855, he wrote the following text published by Maria Weston Chapman in the ''Liberty Bell: Testimony against Slavery''\u000a{{Quote|I do not think it is for me, a foreigner, to indicate to the United States the time, the measures, or the men by whom Slavery shall be abolished.\u000aStill, as the persevering enemy of despotism everywhere, and under all its forms, I am pained and astonished by the fact that the freest people in the world is, at the present time, almost the only one among civilized and Christian nations which yet maintains personal servitude; and this while serfdom itself is about disappearing, where it has not already disappeared, from the most degraded nations of Europe.<br />\u000aAn old and sincere friend of America, I am uneasy at seeing Slavery retard her progress, tarnish her glory, furnish arms to her detractors, compromise the future career of the Union which is the guaranty of her safety and greatness, and point out beforehand to her, to all her enemies, the spot where they are to strike. As a man, too, I am moved at the spectacle of man's degradation by man, and I hope to see the day when the law will grant equal civil liberty to all the inhabitants of the same empire, as God accords the freedom of the will, without distinction, to the dwellers upon earth.<ref>In {{lang|fr|''Oeuvres completes''}}, Gallimard, T.

As Tocqueville predicted, formal freedom and equality and segregation would become this population's reality after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] \u2013 as would the bumpy road to true integration of Black people.\u000a\u000aAssimilation, however, was the best solution for Native Americans and since they were too proud to assimilate, they would inevitably become extinct. [[Forced migration|Displacement]] was another part of America's [[Indian Removal|Indian policy]]. Both populations were "undemocratic", or without the qualities, intellectual and otherwise, needed to live in a democracy. Tocqueville shared many views on assimilation and segregation of his and the coming epochs, but he opposed [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s theories as found in ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races|The Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853\u201355).<ref>See {{lang|fr|''Correspondence avec Arthur de Gobineau''}}, quoted by [http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/fr/art/2001/299.htm Jean-Louis Benoît]</ref>\u000a\u000a===On the US and Russia as future global powers===\u000aIn his ''Democracy In America'', Tocqueville also forecast the preeminence of the United States and Russia as the two main global powers. In his book, he stated:\u000a\u000a"There are now two great nations in the world, which starting from different points, seem to be advancing toward the same goal: the Russians and the Anglo-Americans... Each seems called by some secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world."<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'', pp. 412\u201313.</ref>\u000a\u000a=== On civil jury service ===\u000a\u000aDe Tocqueville believed that the American jury system was particularly important in educating citizens in self-government and rule of law. <ref name= "Civil Jury"> Hans, Valerie P.; Gastil, John; and Feller, Traci, "Deliberative Democracy and the American Civil Jury" (2014). Cornell Law Faculty Publications. Paper 1328.\u000ahttp://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1328  </ref> He often expressed how the civil jury system was one of the most effective showcases of democracy because it connected citizens with the true spirit of the justice system. In his 1835 treatise, [[Democracy in America]], he explained:<br />\u000a\u000a"The jury, and more especially the civil jury, serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for free institutions. . . . It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy; it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge toward society; and the part which they take in the Government. " <ref> Tocqueville, Alexis de ([1835] 1961) Democracy in America. New York: Schocken. <http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC>. </ref><br />\u000a\u000aTocqueville believed that jury service not only benefited the society as a whole, but enhanced jurors\u2019 qualities as citizens. Because of the jury system "they were better informed about the rule of law, and they were more closely connected to the state. Thus, quite independently of what the jury contributed to dispute resolution, participation on the jury had salutary effects on the jurors themselves." <ref name="Civil Jury" />\u000a\u000a==1841 discourse on the Conquest of Algeria==\u000aFrench historian of [[colonialism]] [[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]] has underlined how Tocqueville (as well as [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]]) used the term "[[Genocide|extermination]]" to describe what was happening during the colonization of Western United States and the [[Indian removal]] period.<ref name="Negationnism">{{Cite news|author=[[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]] |title=Le négationnisme colonial |work=[[Le Monde]] |date=2 February 2005 |url=http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=491 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228040334/http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=491 |archivedate=28 February 2006 }}</ref> Tocqueville thus expressed himself, in 1841, concerning the [[French rule in Algeria|conquest of Algeria]]:\u000a\u000a{{Quote|As far as I am concerned, I came back from Africa with the pathetic notion that at present in our way of waging war we are far more barbaric than the Arabs themselves. These days, they represent civilization, we do not. This way of waging war seems to me as stupid as it is cruel. It can only be found in the head of a coarse and brutal soldier. Indeed, it was pointless to replace the Turks only to reproduce what the world rightly found so hateful in them. This, even for the sake of interest is more noxious than useful; for, as another officer was telling me, if our sole aim is to equal the Turks, in fact we shall be in a far lower position than theirs: barbarians for barbarians, the Turks will always outdo us because they are Muslim barbarians.\u000aIn France, I have often heard men I respect but do not approve of, deplore that crops should be burnt and granaries emptied and finally that unarmed men, women, and children should be seized. In my view these are unfortunate circumstances that any people wishing to wage war against the Arabs must accept. I think that all the means available to wreck tribes must be used, barring those that the human kind and the right of nations condemn. I personally believe that the laws of war enable us to ravage the country and that we must do so either by destroying the crops at harvest time or any time by making fast forays also known as raids the aim of which it to get hold of men or flocks.<ref>1841 \u2013 Extract of {{lang|fr|''Travail sur l'Algérie''}}, in {{lang|fr|\u0152uvres complètes}}, Gallimard, Pléïade, 1991, pp. 704\u201305.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison |title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France \u2013 Liberty, Equality and Colony |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = June 2001|url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}} (quoting Alexis de Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|''Travail sur l'Algérie''}} in {{lang|fr|''\u0152uvres complètes''}}, Paris, Gallimard, [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]], 1991, pp. 704\u201305).</ref>}}\u000a\u000a{{Quote|Whatever the case, we may say in a general manner that all [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]] must be [[state of emergency|suspended]] in Algeria.<ref>{{cite web|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison |title=Tocqueville et la conquête de l'Algérie |year=2001 |publisher=La Mazarine |url=http://perso.wanadoo.fr/felina/doc/alg/olcg.htm|language=fr}}</ref>}}\u000a\u000aTocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society.<ref name="Monde diplomatique">{{Cite news|author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison |title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France \u2013 Liberty, Equality and Colony |work=Le Monde diplomatique |date = June 2001|url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2}}</ref>\u000aTocqueville believed that war and colonization would "restore national pride, threatened", he believed, by "the gradual softening of social mores" in the middle classes.

Benoît claimed that it was wrong to assume Tocqueville was a supporter of Bugeaud, despite his 1841 apologetic discourse. It seems that Tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to Algeria in 1846; he criticized Bugeaud's desire to invade [[Kabylie]] in an 1847 speech to the Assembly.\u000a\u000aAlthough Tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law, administrators, schools, etc., for [[Arab]]s who had come under French control, he judged the Berber tribes of Kabylie (in his second of ''Two Letters on Algeria'', 1837) as "savages" not suited for this arrangement; they would best be managed, he argued, not by force of arms, but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction.\u000a\u000aTocqueville's views on the matter were complex. Even though in his 1841 report on Algeria he applauded Bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Abd-el-Kader]]'s resistance, he had advocated in the ''Two Letters'' that the French military advance leave Kabylie undisturbed, and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into Kabylie.\u000a\u000aIn the debate about the 1846 extraordinary funds, Tocqueville denounced Bugeaud's conduct of military operations, and succeeded in convincing the Assembly not to vote funds in support of Bugeaud's military columns.<ref>Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|Oeuvres completes}}, III, 1, Gallimard, 1962, pp. 299\u2013300.</ref> Tocqueville considered Bugeaud's plan to invade Kabylie, despite the opposition of the Assembly, as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice.<ref>Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|Oeuvres completes}}, III, 1, Gallimard, 1962, pp. 303.</ref><ref>Tocqueville, {{lang|fr|\u0152uvres complètes}}, III, 1, Gallimard, 1962, pp. 299\u2013306.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Report on Algeria (1847)==\u000aIn his 1847 Report on Algeria, Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the [[European colonization of the Americas]] in order to avoid the bloody consequences.<ref>Jean-Louis Benoît, [http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/fr/art/2001/299.htm "Arguments in favor of Tocqueville"].{{fr icon}}</ref> More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged, colonization will end in a blood bath.\u000a\u000aTocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria, including the various Arab tribes, independent Kabyles living in the [[Atlas Mountains]], and the powerful political leader [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Abd-el-Kader]]. In his various letters and essays on Algeria, Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country can approach imperialism. In particular, the author differentiates between what he terms 'dominance' and a particular version of 'colonization'.<ref name="Tocqueville 2001, pp. 57\u201364">Alexis De Tocqueville, ''Writings on Empire and Slavery'', ed. Jennifer Pitts, Johns Hopkins (Baltimore), 2001, pp. 57\u201364.</ref>\u000a\u000aThe latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth. In the case of Algeria, the Port of Algiers, and the control over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], were considered by Tocqueville to be particularly valuable. Direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria, however, was not. Thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas.<ref name="Tocqueville 2001, pp. 57\u201364"/>\u000a\u000aTocqueville argued that domination via violent means, though unpleasant, is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war. Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with [[Just war theory]]'s [[jus ad bellum]] criteria of [[just cause]]. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's ''jus in bello'' criteria of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] and discrimination.<ref>De Tocqueville.
