It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage "[[Cybernetics]]" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called "Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems".\u000a\u000a===Doomsday equation===\u000aA 1960 issue of ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula.<ref>{{Cite journal\u000a | author = Heinz von Foerster, P.

In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.\u000a\u000aResponders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time.
