He conceived the idea of the [[Omega Point]] (a maximum level of complexity and consciousness towards which he believed the universe was evolving) and developed [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s concept of [[noosphere]].\u000a\u000aDuring his lifetime, many of Teilhard's writings were [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|censored by the Catholic Church]] because of his views on [[Original sin#Roman Catholicism|original sin]]. Recently Teilhard has been praised by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and other eminent Catholic figures. The response to his writings by evolutionary biologists has been, with some exceptions, decidedly negative.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000a{{jesuit}}\u000a\u000a===Early years===\u000aPierre Teilhard de Chardin was born in the Château of Sarcenat at [[Orcines]], close to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[France]], on May 1, 1881. On the Teilhard side he is descended from an ancient family of magistrates from [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] originating in [[Murat, Cantal]], and on the de Chardin side he is descended from a family that was ennobled under [[Louis XVIII]]. He was the fourth of eleven children. His father, Emmanuel Teilhard (1844\u20131932), an amateur [[naturalist]], collected stones, insects and plants and promoted the observation of nature in the household. Pierre Teilhard's [[spirituality]] was awakened by his mother, Berthe de Dompiere. When he was 12, he went to the [[Jesuit]] college of Mongré, in [[Villefranche-sur-Saône]], where he completed [[Baccalauréat|baccalaureates]] of [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]]. Then, in 1899, he entered the Jesuit novitiate at [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he began a philosophical, theological and spiritual career.\u000a\u000aAs of the summer 1901, the [[Waldeck-Rousseau]] laws, which submitted congregational associations' properties to state control, prompted some of the Jesuits to exile themselves in the [[United Kingdom]]. Young Jesuit students continued their studies in [[Jersey]]. In the meantime, Teilhard earned a licentiate in literature in [[Caen]] in 1902.\u000a\u000a===Academic career===\u000aFrom 1905 to 1908, he taught [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], at the [[Jesuit]] College of the Holy Family. He wrote "... it is the dazzling of the East foreseen and drunk greedily ... in its lights, its vegetation, its fauna and its deserts." (''Letters from Egypt'' (1905\u20131908)&nbsp;\u2014 ''Éditions Aubier'')\u000a\u000aTeilhard studied theology in [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]] (United Kingdom), from 1908 to 1912. There he synthesized his scientific, philosophical and theological knowledge in the light of [[evolution]]. His reading of ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|L'Évolution Créatrice]]'' (The Creative Evolution) by [[Henri Bergson]] was, he said, the "catalyst of a fire which devoured already its heart and its spirit."  Teilhard was [[ordained]] a [[priest]] on August 24, 1911, at age 30.\u000a\u000a===Paleontology===\u000aFrom 1912 to 1914, Teilhard worked in the [[paleontology]] laboratory of the ''[[Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle]]'', in [[Paris]], studying the [[mammal]]s of the middle [[Tertiary]] period. Later he studied elsewhere in [[Europe]]. In June 1912 he formed part of the original digging team, with [[Arthur Smith Woodward]] and [[Charles Dawson]] at the [[Piltdown]] site, after the discovery of the first fragments of the (fraudulent) "[[Piltdown Man]]", with some even suggesting he participated in the hoax.<ref>[http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_prim_suspects/teilhard_de_chardin/Chardin_defend/teilhardandpilthoax(lukas).html "Teilhard and the Piltdown 'Hoax'"]</ref><ref>http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-to-solve-human-evolutions-greatest-hoax-167921335/</ref> Professor [[Marcellin Boule]] (specialist in [[Neanderthal]] studies), who so early as 1915 astutely recognized the non-[[hominid]] origins of the Piltdown finds, gradually guided Teilhard towards human paleontology. At the museum's Institute of Human Paleontology, he became a friend of [[Henri Breuil]] and took part with him, in 1913, in excavations at the prehistoric painted [[Cuevas de El Castillo|Caves of Castillo]] in the northwest of Spain.\u000a\u000a===Service in World War I===\u000aMobilised in December 1914, Teilhard served in [[World War I]] as a stretcher-bearer in the [[French colonial forces|8th Moroccan Rifles]]. For his [[valour]], he received several citations including the [[Médaille militaire]] and the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]].\u000a\u000aThroughout these years of war he developed his reflections in his diaries and in letters to his cousin, Marguerite Teillard-Chambon, who later edited them into a book: ''Genèse d'une pensée'' (''Genesis of a thought''). He confessed later: "...the war was a meeting ... with the Absolute." In 1916, he wrote his first essay: ''La Vie Cosmique'' (''Cosmic life''), where his scientific and philosophical thought was revealed just as his mystical life. He pronounced his solemn vows as a Jesuit in [[Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon]], on May 26, 1918, during a leave. In August 1919, in [[Jersey]], he would write ''Puissance spirituelle de la Matière'' (''The Spiritual Power of Matter'').\u000a\u000aTeilhard followed at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] three unit degrees of natural science: [[geology]], [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. His thesis treated of the mammals of the French lower [[Eocene]] and their [[stratigraphy]]. After 1920, he lectured in geology at the [[Catholic Institute of Paris]], then became an assistant professor after being granted a science doctorate in 1922.\u000a\u000a===Research in China===\u000a[[File:Homo erectus pekinensis - archeaeological.png|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of ''Homo erectus pekinensis''.]]\u000a\u000aIn 1923, he travelled to [[China]] with Father [[Emile Licent]], who was in charge in [[Tianjin]] of a significant laboratory collaboration between the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Natural History Museum]] in [[Paris]] and Marcellin Boule's laboratory. Licent carried out considerable basic work in connection with [[missionary|missionaries]] who accumulated observations of a scientific nature in their spare time. He was known as \u5fb7\u65e5\u9032 (pinyin: Dérìjìn) in China.\u000a\u000aTeilhard wrote several essays, including ''La Messe sur le Monde'' (the ''Mass on the World''), in the [[Ordos Desert]]. In the following year he continued lecturing at the Catholic Institute and participated in a cycle of conferences for the students of the Engineers' Schools. Two theological essays on [[Original Sin]] sent to a theologian at his request on a purely personal basis were wrongly understood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\u000a\u000a* July 1920: ''Chute, Rédemption et Géocentrie'' (''Fall, Redemption and Geocentry'')\u000a* Spring 1922: ''Notes sur quelques représentations historiques possibles du Péché originel'' (''Note on Some Possible Historical Representations of Original Sin'') (Works, Tome X)\u000a\u000aThe [[Catholic Church|Church]] required him to give up his lecturing at the Catholic Institute and to continue his geological research in China.\u000a\u000aTeilhard traveled again to China in April 1926. He would remain there more or less twenty years, with many voyages throughout the world. He settled until 1932 in [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] with Emile Licent then in [[Beijing]]. From 1926 to 1935, Teilhard made five geological research expeditions in China. They enabled him to establish a general geological map of China.\u000a\u000aIn 1926, Teilhard\u2019s superiors in the Jesuit Order forbade him to teach any longer. In 1926\u20131927 after a missed campaign in [[Gansu]], he traveled in the [[Sang-Kan-Ho]] valley near Kalgan ([[Zhangjiakou]]) and made a tour in Eastern [[Mongolia]]. He wrote ''Le Milieu Divin'' (''The Divine Milieu''). Teilhard prepared the first pages of his main work ''Le Phénomène Humain'' (''The Human Phenomenon''). The Holy See refused the Imprimatur for ''Le Milieu Divin'' in 1927.\u000a\u000aHe joined the ongoing excavations of the [[Peking Man]] Site at [[Zhoukoudian]] as an advisor in 1926 and continued in the role for the [[Cenozoic Research Laboratory]] of the [[Geological Survey of China]] following its founding in 1928.\u000a\u000aHe resided in [[Manchuria]] with Emile Licent, then stayed in Western Shansi ([[Shanxi]]) and northern Shensi ([[Shaanxi]]) with the Chinese paleontologist [[Yang Zhongjian|C. C. Young]] and with [[Davidson Black]], Chairman of the [[Geological Survey of China]].\u000a\u000aAfter a tour in Manchuria in the area of [[Great Khingan]] with Chinese geologists, Teilhard joined the team of American Expedition Center-Asia in the [[Gobi Desert]] organised in June and July, by the [[American Museum of Natural History]] with [[Roy Chapman Andrews]].\u000a\u000aHenri Breuil and Teilhard discovered that the [[Peking Man]], the nearest relative of ''[[Pithecanthropus]]'' from [[Java (island)|Java]], was a ''faber'' (worker of stones and controller of fire). Teilhard wrote ''L'Esprit de la Terre'' (''the Spirit of the Earth'').\u000a\u000aTeilhard took part as a scientist in the [[Croisiere Jaune]] (Yellow Cruise) financed by [[André Citroën]] in [[Central Asia]]. Northwest of Beijing in [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]], he joined the Chinese group who joined the second part of the team, the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] group, in [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]]. He remained with his colleagues for several months in [[Urumqi]], capital of [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]]. The following year the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)]] began.\u000a\u000aIn 1933, Rome ordered him to give up his post in Paris.\u000a\u000aTeilhard undertook several explorations in the south of China. He traveled in the valleys of [[Yangtze River]] and [[Sichuan]] in 1934, then, the following year, in [[Kwang-If]] and [[Guangdong]]. The relationship with Marcellin Boule was disrupted; the museum cut its financing on the grounds that Teilhard worked more for the Chinese Geological Service than for the museum.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\u000a\u000aDuring all these years, Teilhard strongly contributed to the constitution of an international network of research in human paleontology related to the whole Eastern and south Eastern zone of the Asian continent. He would be particularly associated in this task with two friends, the English/Canadian Davidson Black and the [[Scot]] [[George B. Barbour]]. Many times he would visit [[France]] or the [[United States]] only to leave these countries to go on further expeditions.\u000a\u000a===World travels===\u000a[[File:TeilhardP 1947.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1947)]]\u000a\u000aFrom 1927 to 1928, Teilhard stayed in France, based in Paris. He journeyed to [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]], to [[Cantal]], and to [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], France. Between several articles in reviews, he met new people such as [[Paul Valéry]] and [[Bruno de Solages]], who were to help him in issues with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]].\u000a\u000aAnswering an invitation from [[Henry de Monfreid]], Teilhard undertook a journey of two months in [[Obock]], in [[Harrar]] and in [[Somalia]] with his colleague [[Pierre Lamarre]], a geologist, before embarking in [[Djibouti]] to return to [[Tianjin]]. While in China, Teilhard developed a deep and personal friendship with [[Lucile Swan]].<ref name = "Aczel">{{cite book | last = Aczel| first = Amir | authorlink = Amir Aczel| coauthors = | title =The Jesuit and the Skull: Teilhard de Chardin, Evolution, and the Search for Peking Man | publisher = Riverhead Trade| date = 4 November 2008| location = | page = 320| isbn = 978-1-594489-56-3}}</ref>\u000a\u000aFrom 1930\u20131931, Teilhard stayed in France and in the United States. During a conference in Paris, Teilhard stated: "For the observers of the Future, the greatest event will be the sudden appearance of a collective humane [[conscience]] and a human work to make."\u000a\u000aFrom 1932\u20131933, he began to meet people to clarify issues with the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], regarding ''Le Milieu divin'' and ''L'Esprit de la Terre''. He met [[Helmut de Terra]], a [[Germans|German]] geologist in the [[International Union of Geological Sciences|International Geology Congress]] in [[Washington, DC]].\u000a\u000aTeilhard participated in the 1935 [[Yale University|Yale]]\u2013[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] expedition in northern and central [[India]] with the geologist [[Helmut de Terra]] and Patterson, who verified their assumptions on Indian [[Paleolithic]] civilisations in [[Kashmir]] and the [[Salt Range Valley]]. He then made a short stay in [[Java (island)|Java]], on the invitation of Professor [[Ralph van Koenigswald]] to the site of [[Java man]]. A second [[human skull|cranium]], more complete, was discovered. This [[Netherlands|Dutch]] paleontologist had found (in 1933) a tooth in a Chinese [[apothecary]] shop in 1934 that he believed belonged to a giant tall [[ape]] that lived around half a million years ago.\u000a\u000aIn 1937, Teilhard wrote ''Le Phénomène spirituel'' (''The Phenomenon of the Spirit'') on board the boat ''the Empress of Japan'', where he met the [[Raja]] of [[Sarawak]]. The ship conveyed him to the United States. He received the [[Mendel Medal]] granted by [[Villanova University]] during the Congress of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in recognition of his works on human paleontology. He made a speech about [[evolution]], origins and the destiny of Man. The ''[[New York Times]]'' dated March 19, 1937 presented Teilhard as the Jesuit who held that [[human|man]] descended from [[monkeys]]. Some days later, he was to be granted the ''[[Doctor Honoris Causa]]'' distinction from [[Boston College]]. Upon arrival in that city, he was told that the award had been cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\u000a\u000a1939: Rome banned his work ''L\u2019Énergie Humaine''.\u000a\u000aHe then stayed in France, where he was immobilized by [[malaria]]. During his return voyage to Beijing he wrote ''L'Energie spirituelle de la Souffrance'' (''Spiritual Energy of Suffering'') (Complete Works, tome VII).\u000a\u000a1941: Teilhard submitted to Rome his most important work, ''Le Phénomène Humain''.\u000a\u000a1947: Rome forbade him to write or teach on philosophical subjects.\u000a\u000a1948: Teilhard was called to Rome by the Superior General of the Jesuits who hoped to acquire permission from the Holy See for the publication of his most important work ''Le Phénomène Humain''. But the prohibition to publish it issued in 1944, was again renewed. Teilhard was also forbidden to take a teaching post in the College de France.\u000a\u000a1949: Permission to publish ''Le Groupe Zoologique'' was refused.\u000a\u000a1950:  Teilhard was named to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].\u000a\u000a1955: Teilhard was forbidden by his Superiors to attend the International Congress of\u000aPaleontology.\u000a\u000a1957: The Supreme Authority of the Holy Office, in a decree dated 15 November 1957, forbade the works of de Chardin to be retained in libraries, including those of [[religious institute]]s. His books were not to be sold in Catholic bookshops and were not to be translated into other languages.\u000a\u000a1958: In April of this year, all Jesuit publications in Spain ("Razón y Fe", "Sal Terrae","Estudios de Deusto") etc., carried a notice from the Spanish Provincial of the Jesuits that Teilhard's works had been published in Spanish without previous ecclesiastical examination and in defiance of the decrees of the Holy See.\u000a\u000a1962: A decree of the Holy Office dated 30 June, under the authority of Pope John XXIII warned that "... it is obvious that in philosophical and theological matters, the said works [Teilhard\u2019s] are replete with ambiguities or rather with serious errors which offend Catholic doctrine. That is why... the Rev. Fathers of the Holy Office urge all Ordinaries, Superiors, and Rectors... to effectively protect, especially the minds of the young, against the dangers of the works of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin and his followers". (AAS, 6 August 1962).\u000a\u000a1963: The Vicariate of Rome (a diocese ruled in the name of Pope Paul VI (who had just become Pope in 1963) by his Cardinal Vicar) in a decree dated 30 September, required that Catholic booksellers in Rome should withdraw from circulation the works of Teilhard, together with those books which favour his erroneous doctrines. The text of this document was published in daily ''L\u2019Aurore'' of Paris, dated 2 October 1963, and was reproduced in ''Nouvelles De Chrétienté'', 10 October 1963, p.&nbsp;35.\u000a\u000a===Death===\u000aPierre Teilhard de Chardin died in [[New York City]], where he was in residence at the Jesuit [[Church of St. Ignatius Loyola (New York City)|Church of St. Ignatius Loyola]], [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]]. On March 15, 1955, at the house of his diplomat cousin Jean de Lagarde, Teilhard told friends he hoped he would die on Easter Sunday.<ref>Smulders, Pieter Frans \u2666 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o4ewAAAAIAAJ&q=%22On+March+15,+1955,+he+told+friends+he+hoped+he+would+die+on+Easter+Sunday,+the+feast+of+his+own+Messe+sur+le+monde.%22&dq=%22On+March+15,+1955,+he+told+friends+he+hoped+he+would+die+on+Easter+Sunday,+the+feast+of+his+own+Messe+sur+le+monde.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIjKqf_t2gxwIViaweCh0uygXc The design of Teilhard de Chardin: an essay in theological reflection] 1967</ref> In the [[Easter Sunday]] evening of April 10, 1955, during an animated discussion at the apartment of Rhoda de Terra, his personal assistant since 1949, the 73-year-old priest suffered a heart attack; regaining consciousness for a moment, he died a few minutes later.<ref>Smulders, Pieter Frans \u2666 [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&num=10&lr=&ft=i&cr=&safe=images&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbo=u&tbs=bks:1&source=og&q=%22Three%20days%20later%2C%20on%20Easter%20Sunday%2C%20he%20was%20quite%20suddenly%22&sa=N&tab=wp&cad=cbv#sclient=psy&hl=en&lr=&tbs=bks%3A1&q=%22In+the+afternoon%2C+at+the+house+of+friends%2C+he+was+felled+by+a+heart+seizure%3B+regaining+consciousness+for+a+moment%2C+he+died+a+few+minutes+later%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=8652cbd0fdc5ba22 The design of Teilhard de Chardin: an essay in theological reflection] 1967</ref> He was buried in the cemetery for the New York Province of the Jesuits at the Jesuit novitiate, St. Andrew's-on-the-Hudson in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[upstate New York]].<ref>{{Find a Grave|6725251|Pierre Teilhard De Chardin|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Teachings==\u000aTeilhard de Chardin has two comprehensive works, ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'', and ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9RbFkgbrWaAC&printsec=frontcover The Divine Milieu]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Divine Milieu: Work by Teilhard de Chardin|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Divine-Milieu|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHis posthumously published book, ''The Phenomenon of Man'', sets forth a sweeping account of the unfolding of the [[cosmos]] and the evolution of matter to humanity, to ultimately a reunion with Christ. In the book, Teilhard abandoned literal interpretations of creation in the [[Book of Genesis]] in favor of allegorical and theological interpretations. The unfolding of the material [[cosmos]], is described from [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] particles to the development of life, human beings and the [[noosphere]], and finally to his vision of the [[Omega Point]] in the future, which is "pulling" all creation towards it.  He was a leading proponent of [[orthogenesis]], the idea that [[evolution]] occurs in a directional, goal-driven way, argued in terms that today go under the banner of [[convergent evolution]].  Teilhard argued in [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian terms with respect to biology, and supported the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|synthetic model of evolution]], but argued in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian terms]] for the development of culture, primarily through the vehicle of education.<ref>{{YouTube|OoI4Bamf-9s|"Teilhard de Chardin, Orthogenesis, and the Mechanism of Evolutionary Change"}} by [http://www.thomasfglick.com/ Thomas F Glick].</ref> Teilhard made a total commitment to the evolutionary process in the 1920s as the core of his spirituality, at a time when other religious thinkers felt evolutionary thinking challenged the structure of conventional Christian faith.

He interprets complexity as the axis of evolution of matter into a geosphere, a biosphere, into consciousness (in man), and then to supreme consciousness (the Omega Point.)\u000a\u000aTeilhard\u2019s unique relationship to both [[paleontology]] and [[Catholicism]] allowed him to develop a highly progressive, cosmic theology which takes into account his evolutionary studies.  Teilhard recognized the importance of bringing the Church into the modern world, and approached [[evolution]] as a way of providing ontological meaning for Christianity, particularly creation theology.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Galleni|first1=Ludovico|last2=Scalfari|first2=Francesco|title=Teilhard de Chardin's Engagement with the Relationship between Science and Theology in Light of Discussions about Environmental Ethics|journal=Ecotheology|date=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=197|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>   For Teilhard, evolution was "the natural landscape where the history of salvation is situated."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Galleni|first1=Ludovico|last2=Scalfari|first2=Francesco|title=Teilhard de Chardin's Engagement with the Relationship between Science and Theology in Light of Discussions about Environment Ethics|journal=Ecotheology|date=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=197|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\u000a\u000aTeilhard\u2019s cosmic theology is largely predicated on his interpretation of [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline scripture]], particularly Colossians 1:15-17 (especially verse 1:17b) and 1Corinthians 15:28.  Teilhard draws on the Christocentrism of these two Pauline passages to construct a cosmic theology which recognizes the absolute primacy of Christ.  He understands creation to be "a [[teleology|teleological]] process towards union with the Godhead, effected through the incarnation and redemption of Christ, \u2018in whom all things hold together\u2019 (Col. 1:17)."<ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=J.A.|title=The Cosmic Christ in Origen and Teilhard de Chardin: A Comparative Study|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=39}}</ref>   He further posits that creation will not be complete until "participated being is totally united with God through Christ in the [[Pleroma]], when God will be \u2018all in all\u2019 (1Cor. 15:28)."<ref name="Oxford University Press"/> \u000a \u000aTeilhard's life work was predicated on the conviction that human spiritual development is moved by the same universal laws as material development.  He wrote, "...everything is the sum of the past" and "...nothing is comprehensible except through its history.  'Nature' is the equivalent of 'becoming', self-creation: this is the view to which experience irresistibly leads us. ...  There is nothing, not even the human soul, the highest spiritual manifestation we know of, that does not come within this universal law."<ref>Teilhard de Chardin: [http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2287&C=2162 "A Note on Progress"]</ref>  There is no doubt that ''The Phenomenon of Man'' represents Teilhard's attempt at reconciling his religious [[Catholicism|faith]] with his academic interests as a [[paleontologist]].<ref name="phenomenon1">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, ''The Phenomenon of Man'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1959), 250\u201375.</ref> One particularly poignant observation in Teilhard's book entails the notion that [[evolution]] is becoming an increasingly optional [[Process (science)|process]].<ref name="phenomenon1"/> Teilhard points to the societal problems of [[Solitude|isolation]] and [[marginalization]] as huge [[:wikt:inhibit|inhibitor]]s of evolution, especially since evolution requires a unification of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]].

Teilhard also states that "evolution is an ascent toward consciousness", giving [[encephalization]] as an example of early stages, and therefore, signifies a continuous upsurge toward the [[Omega Point]],<ref name="phenomenon1"/> which for all intents and purposes, is [[God]].\u000a\u000aTeilhard also used his perceived correlation between spiritual and material to describe Christ, arguing that Christ not only has a [[mystical]] dimension,  but also takes on a physical dimension as he becomes the organizing principle of the universe\u2014that is, the one who "holds together" the universe (Col. 1:17b).  For Teilhard, Christ forms not only the [[eschatological]] end toward which his mystical/ecclesial body is oriented, but he also "operates physically in order to regulate all things"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=J.A.|title=The Cosmic Christ in Origen and Teilhard de Chardin: A Comparative Study|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=154}}</ref>  becoming "the one from whom all creation receives its stability."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=J.A.|title=The Cosmic Christ in Origen and Teilhard de Chardin: A Comparative Study|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=152}}</ref>  In other words, as the one who holds all things together, "Christ exercises a supremacy over the universe which is physical, not simply juridical.  He is the unifying centre of the universe and its goal.  The function of holding all things together indicates that Christ is not only man and God; he also possesses a third aspect\u2014indeed, a third nature\u2014which is cosmic."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=J.A.|title=The Cosmic Christ in Origen and Teilhard de Chardin: A Comparative Study|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=153}}</ref>   In this way, the Pauline description of the [[Body of Christ]] is not simply a mystical or [[ecclesial]] concept for Teilhard; it is cosmic.  This cosmic Body of Christ "extend[s] throughout the universe and compris[es] all things that attain their fulfillment in Christ [so that] . . . the Body of Christ is the one single thing that is being made in creation."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=J.A.|title=The Cosmic Christ in Origen and Teilhard de Chardin: A Comparative Study|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=154\u2013155}}</ref>  Teilhard describes this cosmic amassing of Christ as "Christogenesis." According to Teilhard, the universe is engaged in Christogenesis as it evolves toward its full realization at [[Omega Point|Omega]], a point which coincides with the fully realized Christ.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/>   It is at this point that God will be \u2018all in all\u2019 (1Cor. 15:28c).\u000a\u000a{{quotation|Our century is probably more religious than any other. How could it fail to be, with such problems to be solved? The only trouble is that it has not yet found a God it can adore.<ref name="phenomenon1"/>}}\u000a\u000a==Relationship with the Catholic Church==\u000a\u000aIn 1925, Teilhard was ordered by the [[Father General|Jesuit Superior General]] [[Wlodimir Ledóchowski]] to leave his teaching position in France and to sign a statement withdrawing his controversial statements regarding the [[Original Sin|doctrine of original sin]]. Rather than leave the Jesuit order, Teilhard signed the statement and left for [[China]].\u000a\u000aThis was the first of a series of condemnations by certain [[ecclesiastical]] officials that would continue until after Teilhard's death. The climax of these condemnations was a 1962 [[monitum]] (reprimand) of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] cautioning on Teilhard's works. It said in part:<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/dechardin.txt  ''Warning Considering the Writings of Father Teilhard de Chardin''], Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, June 30, 1962.</ref>\u000a\u000a{{quote|The above-mentioned works abound in such ambiguities and indeed even serious errors, as to offend Catholic doctrine... For this reason, the most eminent and most revered Fathers of the Holy Office exhort all Ordinaries as well as the superiors of Religious institutes, rectors of seminaries and presidents of universities, effectively to protect the minds, particularly of the youth, against the dangers presented by the works of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin and of his followers.}}\u000a\u000aThe Holy Office did not place any of Teilhard's writings on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (Index of Forbidden Books), which existed during Teilhard's lifetime and at the time of the 1962 decree.\u000a\u000aShortly thereafter, prominent clerics mounted a strong theological defense of Teilhard's works. [[Henri de Lubac]] (later a Cardinal) wrote three comprehensive books on the theology of Teilhard de Chardin in the 1960s. While de Lubac mentioned that Teilhard was less than precise in some of his concepts, he affirmed the orthodoxy of Teilhard de Chardin and responded to Teilhard's critics: "We need not concern ourselves with a number of detractors of Teilhard, in whom emotion has blunted intelligence".<ref>Cardinal Henri Cardinal de Lubac, S.J.&nbsp;\u2013 The Religion of Teilhard de Chardin, Image Books (1968)</ref> Later that decade [[Joseph Ratzinger]], a German theologian who became Pope Benedict XVI, spoke glowingly of Teilhard's Christology in Ratzinger's ''Introduction to Christianity'':<ref>Ratzinger, Joseph Cardinal; Pope Benedict XVI; Benedict; J. R. Foster; Michael J. Miller (2010-06-04). Introduction To Christianity, 2nd Edition (Kindle Locations 2840-2865). Ignatius Press. Kindle Edition.</ref>\u000a\u000a{{quote|It must be regarded as an important service of Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s that he rethought these ideas from the angle of the modern view of the world and, in spite of a not entirely unobjectionable tendency toward the biological approach, nevertheless on the whole grasped them correctly and in any case made them accessible once again. Let us listen to his own words: The human monad "can only be absolutely itself by ceasing to be alone". In the background is the idea that in the cosmos, alongside the two orders or classes of the infinitely small and the infinitely big, there is a third order, which determines the real drift of evolution, namely, the order of the infinitely complex. It is the real goal of the ascending process of growth or becoming; it reaches a first peak in the genesis of living things and then continues to advance to those highly complex creations that give the cosmos a new center: "Imperceptible and accidental as the position they hold may be in the history of the heavenly bodies, in the last analysis the planets are nothing less than the vital points of the universe. It is through them that the axis now runs, on them is henceforth concentrated the main effort of an evolution aiming principally at the production of large molecules." The examination of the world by the dynamic criterion of complexity thus signifies "a complete inversion of values. A reversal of the perspective...\u000a\u000aThis leads to a further passage in Teilhard de Chardin that is worth quoting in order to give at least some indication here, by means of a few fragmentary excerpts, of his general outlook. "The Universal Energy must be a Thinking Energy if it is not to be less highly evolved than the ends animated by its action. And consequently ... the attributes of cosmic value with which it is surrounded in our modern eyes do not affect in the slightest the necessity obliging us to recognize in it a transcendent form of Personality.}}\u000a\u000aOver the next several decades prominent theologians and Church leaders, including leading Cardinals, [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] all wrote approvingly of Teilhard's ideas.  In 1981, Cardinal [[Agostino Casaroli]], on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]], wrote on the front page of the Vatican newspaper, ''l'Osservatore Romano'':\u000a{{quote|"What our contemporaries will undoubtedly remember, beyond the difficulties of conception and deficiencies of expression in this audacious attempt to reach a synthesis, is the testimomy of the coherent life of a man possessed by Christ in the depths of his soul.

Although it would probably be incorrect to imagine that the universe will eventually be transubstantiated, Teilhard correctly identified the connection between the Eucharist and the final glorification of the cosmos.}}\u000a\u000aCardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]] wrote in 2007:<ref>Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, Creation, Evolution, and a Rational Faith, Ignatian Press (2007)</ref>\u000a{{quote|Hardly anyone else has tried to bring together the knowledge of Christ and the idea of evolution as the scientist (paleontologist) and theologian Fr.

But this means that the historical makes its appearance in the cosmic. The cosmos is not a kind of closed building, a stationary container in which history may by chance take place. It is itself movement, from its one beginning to its one end. In a sense, creation is history. Against the background of the modern evolutionary world view, Teilhard de Chardin depicted the cosmos as a process of ascent, a series of unions. From very simple beginnings the path leads to ever greater and more complex unities, in which multiplicity is not abolished but merged into a growing synthesis, leading to the "Noosphere", in which spirit and its understanding embrace the whole and are blended into a kind of living organism. Invoking the epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, Teilhard looks on Christ as the energy that strives toward the Noosphere and finally incorporates everything in its "fullness\u2019. From here Teilhard went on to give a new meaning to Christian worship: the transubstantiated Host is the anticipation of the transformation and divinization of matter in the christological "fullness". In his view, the Eucharist provides the movement of the cosmos with its direction; it anticipates its goal and at the same time urges it on.}}\u000a\u000ain July 2009, Vatican spokesman Fr.
