He is the [[Cabot family|Walter M. Cabot]] Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, at [[Harvard University]].\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aStanley Cavell was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. His mother, a locally renowned pianist, trained him in music from his earliest days.<ref>Little Did I Know, 21 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref> During the Depression, Cavell\u2019s parents moved several times between Atlanta and [[Sacramento, California]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 24 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>\u000a\u000aAs a teenager, Cavell played lead [[alto saxophone]] as the youngest and sole white member of a black jazz band in Sacramento.<ref>Little Did I Know, 169 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>  At 16, he entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he majored in music, studying with, among others, [[Roger Sessions]] and [[Ernest Bloch]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 85, 183  (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>  After graduation, he began studies in composition at the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in [[New York City]], only to discover that music was no longer his aspiration.<ref>Little Did I Know, 220-225 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>  He eventually began to study philosophy at [[UCLA]], and then transferred as a graduate student to [[Harvard University]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 247 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>  As a student there he came under the influence of the visiting [[J. L. Austin]], whose teaching and methods "knocked him off ... [his] horse."<ref>The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality and Tragedy, xv (New York: Oxford, 1979).</ref> In 1954 he was awarded a Junior Fellowship at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]]. Before completing his Ph.D., he became an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956.<ref>Little Did I Know, 326 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref> From 1962\u20131963 Cavell was a Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he became a lifelong friend of the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 149 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref> In 1963 he returned to the Harvard Philosophy Department, where he became the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value.<ref>Little Did I Know, 435 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 1964, Cavell joined a group of Harvard faculty and graduate students, who taught at [[Tougaloo College]], a historically black college in Mississippi, as part of what became known as the [[Freedom Summer]].<ref>Little Did I Know, 373 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref> In April 1969, during the time of student protests arising from, among other things, the [[Vietnam War]], Cavell, together with his colleague [[John Rawls]], worked with a group of African-American students to draft language for a vote by the faculty that established the Department of African and African-American Studies at Harvard.<ref>Little Did I Know, 508\u2013512 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1979, along with the documentary filmmaker [[Robert H.

After retiring, he taught courses at [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1998.<ref>[http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html]</ref>\u000a\u000aCavell\u2019s first marriage, to Marcia (Schmid) Cavell, ended in divorce in 1961; their daughter, Rachel Lee Cavell, was born in 1957. He and Cathleen (Cohen) Cavell were married in 1967 and live in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]; they have two sons, Benjamin (born 1976) and David (born 1984).\u000a\u000a==Philosophy==\u000aAlthough trained in the Anglo-American [[analytical philosophy|analytic tradition]], Cavell often interacts with the [[continental philosophy|continental tradition]]. He is well known for his inclusion of [[film]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] study in philosophical inquiry.\u000a\u000aCavell has written extensively on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], as well as on the [[Transcendentalism|American transcendentalists]] [[Henry Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He has been associated with an approach toward interpreting Wittgenstein sometimes known as the [[New Wittgenstein]].\u000a\u000aMuch of Cavell's writing incorporates autobiographical elements concerning how his movement between and within the ideas of these thinkers influenced and influences his own thinking.\u000a\u000a== Selected works ==\u000a\u000a===''Must We Mean What We Say?''===\u000aCavell first established his distinct philosophical identity with a collection of essays, entitled ''Must We Mean What We Say?'' (1969), a work which addresses topics such as language use, metaphor, skepticism, tragedy, and literary interpretation, from the point of view of [[ordinary language philosophy]], of which he is a practitioner and ardent defender. One of the essays discusses [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s work on revelation and authority, ''[[The Book on Adler]]'', in an effort to help re-introduce the book to modern philosophical readers.<ref>''Journal of Religion'', vol. 57, 1977</ref>\u000a\u000a===''The World Viewed''===\u000aIn ''The World Viewed'' (1971) Cavell looks at photography and film. He also writes on modernism in art, and the nature of media, where he mentions the importance to his work of the writing of art critic [[Michael Fried]].\u000a\u000a===''The Claim of Reason''===\u000aCavell is perhaps best known for his book, ''The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy'' (1979), which forms the centerpiece of his work, and which has its origins in his doctoral dissertation. The book was republished in 1999. {{cn|date=February 2016}}\u000a\u000a===''Pursuits of Happiness''===\u000aIn ''Pursuits of Happiness'' (1981), Cavell describes his experience of seven prominent Hollywood comedies: ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', ''[[Adam\u2019s Rib]]'', and ''[[The Awful Truth]]''.  Cavell argues that these films, from the years 1934\u20131949, form part of what he calls the genre of "[[remarriage|The Comedy of Remarriage]]," and he finds in them great philosophical, moral, and indeed political significance.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, Cavell argues that these Hollywood comedies show that "the achievement of happiness requires not the [...] satisfaction of our needs [...] but the examination and transformation of those needs."<ref>Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>  According to Cavell, the emphasis that these movies place on "[[Comedy of remarriage|remarriage]]" draws attention to the fact that, within a relationship, happiness requires "growing up" together with one's partner.<ref>Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, p. 136.</ref>\u000a\u000a===''Cities of Words''===\u000aIn ''Cities of Words'' (2004) Cavell traces the history of [[moral perfectionism]], a mode of moral thinking spanning the history of Western philosophy and literature. Having previously used Emerson to define the concept, this book suggests ways we might want to understand philosophy, literature, and film as preoccupied with features of perfectionism.\u000a\u000a===''Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow''===\u000aIn his most recent collection of essays, ''Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow'' (2005), Cavell makes the case that J. L. Austin's concept of [[performative utterance]] requires the supplementary concept of "passionate utterance": "A performative utterance is an offer of participation in the order of law. And perhaps we can say: A passionate utterance is an invitation to improvisation in the disorders of desire."<ref>Cavell, ''Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, & London: Harvard University Press, 2005), p. 19.</ref> The book also contains extended discussions of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Henry James]], and [[Fred Astaire]], as well as familiar Cavellian subjects such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Emerson, Thoreau, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger.\u000a\u000a===''Little Did I Know''===\u000aCavell's most recent book, ''Little Did I Know: Excerpts from Memory'' (2010), is an autobiography written in the form of a diary. In a series of consecutive, dated entries, Cavell inquires about the origins of his philosophy by telling the story of his life.\u000a\u000a== Honorary degrees ==\u000a*Doctor of Humane Letters, [[Kalamazoo College]], 1980\u000a*Doctor of Letters, [[Iona College]]{{dn|date=April 2015}}, 1985\u000a*Doctor of Humane Letters, [[University of Chicago]], 1987\u000a*Docteur, Honoris Causa, [[Université de Strasbourg]], 1996\u000a*Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa, [[Hebrew University]], 1997\u000a*Doctor of Letters, Honoris Causa, [[University of East Anglia]], 2009\u000a*Docteur, Honoris Causa, [[École normale supérieure de Lyon|Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon]], 2010\u000a*Doctor of Letters, [[Wesleyan University]], 2010\u000a*Doctor of Theology, [[Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris|Institut Protestant de Théologie de Paris]], 2010\u000a\u000a==Selected honors==\u000a*Junior Fellow, [[Society of Fellows]], [[Harvard University]], 1953-56\u000a*Fellow, [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], 1962-1963\u000a*Distinguished Teaching Award, [[University of California, Berkeley]], 1961\u000a*Fellow, [[Wesleyan University]] Center for the Humanities, 1970-1971\u000a*Fellow, [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1978-\u000a*President, [[American Philosophical Association]] (Eastern Division), 1996-97\u000a*2000 Centennial Medalist, [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Arts and Sciences\u000a*Romanell [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Professorship, 2004-05\u000a\u000a==Selected special lectureships==\u000a*Patricia Wise Lecture, [[American Film Institute]], 1982\u000a*Mrs. William Beckman Lectures, [[University of California, Berkeley]], 1983\u000a*Tanner Lecture, [[Stanford University]], April 1986\u000a*Carus Lectures, [[American Philosophical Association]], 1988\u000a*Plenary Address, Shakespeare World Congress, [[Los Angeles]], 1996\u000a*Presidential Address, [[American Philosophical Association]], [[Atlanta]], 1996\u000a*Howison Lectures, [[University of California, Berkeley]], February, 2002\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a* ''Must We Mean What We Say?''
