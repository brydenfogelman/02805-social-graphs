His parents, Isidor and Johanna (née Prausnitzer), took care of their children's education and provided them with private tutoring at home \u2013 Leopold's younger brother [[Hugo Kronecker]] would also follow a scientific path, later becoming a notable [[physiologist]]. Kronecker then went to the Liegnitz [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] where he was interested in a wide range of topics including science, history and philosophy, while also practicing gymnastics and swimming. At the gymnasium he was taught by [[Ernst Kummer]], who noticed and encouraged the boy's interest in mathematics.<ref name="DtI">{{cite book| last = James| first = Ioan Mackenzie| title = Driven to Innovate A Century of Jewish Mathematicians and Physicists| year = 2009| publisher = Peter Lang| isbn = 978-1-906165-22-2| pages = 90\u201394 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1841 Kronecker became a student at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] where his interest did not immediately focus on mathematics, but rather spread over several subjects including astronomy and philosophy. He spent the summer of 1843 at the [[University of Bonn]] studying astronomy and 1843\u201344 at the [[University of Breslau]] following his former teacher Kummer. Back in Berlin, Kronecker studied mathematics with [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and in 1845 defended his dissertation in [[algebraic number theory]] written under Dirichlet's supervision.<ref name="FLA">{{cite book| last = Blyth| first = T.S.| last2 = Robertson| first2 = E.F.| title = Further Linear Algebra| year = 2002| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-1-85233-425-3| pages = 185\u2013186 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter obtaining his degree, Kronecker did not follow his interest in research on an academic career path. He went back to his hometown to manage a large farming estate built up by his mother's uncle, a former banker. In 1848 he married his cousin Fanny Prausnitzer, and the couple had six children. For several years Kronecker focused on business, and although he continued to study mathematics as a hobby and corresponded with Kummer, he published no mathematical results.<ref name="AGM">{{cite book| last = Chang| first = Sooyoung| title = Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians| year = 2010| publisher = World Scientific| isbn = 978-981-4282-29-1| pages = 31\u201332 }}</ref> In 1853 he wrote a memoir on the algebraic solvability of equations extending the work of [[Évariste Galois]] on the [[theory of equations]].\u000a\u000a[[File:KroneckerGrab.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of Kronecker (St Matthäus, Berlin)]]\u000aDue to his business activity, Kronecker was financially comfortable, and thus he could return to Berlin in 1855 to pursue mathematics as a private scholar. Dirichlet, whose wife [[Rebecka Mendelssohn|Rebecka]] came from the wealthy [[Mendelssohn family]], had introduced Kronecker to the Berlin elite. He became a close friend of [[Karl Weierstrass]], who had recently joined the university, and his former teacher Kummer who had just taken over Dirichlet's mathematics chair.<ref name=DtI/> Over the following years Kronecker published numerous papers resulting from his previous years' independent research. As a result of this published research, he was elected a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] in 1861.\u000a\u000aAlthough he held no official university position, Kronecker had the right as a member of the Academy to hold classes at the University of Berlin and he decided to do so, starting in 1862. In 1866, when [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] died, Kronecker was offered the mathematics chair at the [[University of Göttingen]] (previously held by [[Carl Gauss]] and Dirichlet), but he refused, preferring to keep his position at the Academy. Only in 1883, when Kummer retired from the University, was Kronecker invited to succeed him and became an ordinary professor.<ref name="AZ">{{cite book| last = McElroy| first = Tucker| title = A to Z of mathematicians| year = 2005| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-0-8160-5338-4| pages = 154\u2013156 }}</ref> Kronecker was the supervisor of [[Kurt Hensel]], [[Adolf Kneser]], [[Mathias Lerch]], and [[Franz Mertens]], amongst others.\u000a\u000aHis philosophical view of mathematics put him in conflict with several mathematicians over the years, notably straining his relationship with Weierstrass, who almost decided to leave the University in 1888.<ref name="FLA"/> Kronecker died on 29 December 1891 in Berlin, several months after the death of his wife. In the last year of his life, he converted to [[Christianity]].<ref name=DtI/> He is buried in the [[Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof|Alter St Matthäus Kirchhof]] cemetery in [[Berlin]]-[[Schöneberg]], close to [[Gustav Kirchhoff]].{{clear|left}}\u000a\u000a==Scientific activity==\u000a\u000a===Mathematics research===\u000aAn important part of Kronecker's research focused on [[number theory]] and [[algebra]]. In an 1853 paper on the [[theory of equations]] and [[Galois theory]] he formulated the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], without however offering a definitive proof (the theorem was proved completely much later by [[David Hilbert]]). He also introduced the [[Finitely-generated abelian group|structure theorem for finitely-generated abelian groups]]. Kronecker studied [[elliptic functions]] and conjectured his "[[Kronecker's Jugendtraum|liebster Jugendtraum]]" ("dearest dream of youth"), a generalization that was later put forward by Hilbert in a modified form as his [[Hilbert's problems|twelfth problem]].<ref name="Princeton">{{cite book| last1 = Gowers| first1 = Timothy| last2 = Barrow-Green| first2 = June| last3 = Leader| first3 = Imre| title = The Princeton companion to mathematics| year = 2008| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-11880-2| pages = 773\u2013774 }}</ref> In an 1850 paper, ''On the Solution of the General Equation of the Fifth Degree'', Kronecker solved the [[quintic equation]] by applying [[group theory]] (though his solution was not in terms of radicals: that was already proven impossible by the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]).\u000a\u000aIn [[algebraic number theory]] Kronecker introduced the [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|theory of divisors]] as an alternative to [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]'s theory of [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], which he did not find acceptable for philosophical reasons. Although the general adoption of Dedekind's approach led Kronecker's theory to be ignored for a long time, his divisors were found useful and were revived by several mathematicians in the 20th century.<ref name="MA">{{cite book| last = Corry| first = Leo| title = Modern Algebra and the Rise of Mathematical Structures| year = 2004| publisher = Birkhäuser| isbn = 978-3-7643-7002-2| pages = 120 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aKronecker also contributed to the concept of [[continuity (mathematics)|continuity]], reconstructing the form of [[irrational number]]s in [[real number]]s. In [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], Kronecker rejected the formulation of a [[continuous, nowhere differentiable function]] by his colleague, [[Karl Weierstrass]].\u000a\u000aAlso named for Kronecker are the [[Kronecker limit formula]], [[Kronecker's congruence]], [[Kronecker delta]], [[Kronecker delta#The Kronecker comb|Kronecker comb]], [[Kronecker symbol]], [[Kronecker product]], [[Kronecker's method]] for factorizing polynomials, [[Kronecker substitution]], [[Kronecker's theorem]] in number theory, [[Kronecker's lemma]], and [[Eisenstein\u2013Kronecker number]]s.\u000a\u000a===Philosophy of mathematics===\u000aKronecker's [[finitism]]{{Dubious|finitism?|date=April 2012}} made him a forerunner of [[intuitionism]] in [[foundations of mathematics]].\u000a\u000a==Honours==\u000aKronecker was elected as a member of several academies:<ref name=DtI/>\u000a* [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] (1861)\u000a* [[French Academy of Sciences]] (1868)\u000a* [[Royal Society]] (1884).\u000a\u000aThe [[25624 Kronecker]] asteroid is named after him.\u000a\u000a==Publications==\u000a\u000a* {{Citation | last1=Kronecker | first1=Leopold | author1-link=Leopold Kronecker | title=Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie | origyear=1901 | url=https://archive.org/details/vorlesungenberz00krongoog | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-3-540-08277-4 |mr=529431 | year=1978}}\u000a* {{Citation | last1=Kronecker | first1=Leopold | author1-link=Leopold Kronecker | editor1-last=Hensel | editor1-first=Kurt | editor1-link=Kurt Hensel | title=Leopold Kronecker's Werke.
