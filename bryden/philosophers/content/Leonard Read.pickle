He wrote 29 books and numerous essays, including the well-known "[[I, Pencil]]" (1958).\u000a\u000a==Business career==\u000a\u000aAfter a stint in the [[United States Army Air Service]] during [[World War I]], Read started a grocery wholesale business in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], which was initially successful but eventually went out of business.  He moved to [[California]] where he started a new career in the tiny [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] near [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Read gradually moved up the hierarchy of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], finally becoming general manager of the [[Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce|Los Angeles branch]], America's largest, in 1939.\u000a\u000a==Libertarian activism==\u000a\u000aDuring this period his views became progressively more [[libertarianism|libertarian]]. Apparently, it was in 1933, during a meeting with [[William C. Mullendore]], the executive vice president of [[Southern California Edison]], that Read was finally convinced that the [[New Deal]] was completely inefficient and [[morally bankrupt]]. Read was also profoundly influenced by his [[religion|religious beliefs]]. His [[pastor]], Reverend James W. Fifield, was minister of the 4,000-member First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, of which Read was also a board member. Fifield ran a "resistance movement" against the "[[Social Gospel|social gospel]]" of the New Deal, trying to convince ministers across the country to adopt libertarian "spiritual ideals." During the period when he worked for the Chamber of Commerce, Read was also deeply influenced by more secular figures, such as Albert Jay Nock, and, later, by Ayn Rand and the economists Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt.\u000a\u000aIn 1945, [[Virgil Jordan]], the President of the [[National Industrial Conference Board]] (NICB) in New York, invited Read to become its executive vice president. Read realized he would have to leave the NICB to pursue full-time the promotion of free market, limited government principles. He resigned as a  result.<ref>[[Gary North (economist)|North, Gary]].

Goodrich, encouraged Read to start his own organization. With Goodrich's aid, as well as financial aid from the [[William Volker Fund]] and from [[Harold Luhnow]], Read and Hazlitt founded the Foundation for Economic Education in 1946, which, in turn, helped to inspire [[Friedrich Hayek]] to form the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] the following year. For a period in the 1940s, philosopher Ayn Rand was an important adviser, or "ghost," as they called it, to Read.<ref>Burns, Jennifer, ''[[Goddess of the Market|Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]'', 2010, Oxford Univ.

In 1954, Read arranged for the struggling magazine to be transferred to a for-profit company owned by FEE. In 1956, FEE assumed direct control of the magazine, turning it into a non-profit outreach tool for the foundation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Poirot|first1=Paul|title=Consistently and Continuously Standing Against the Fallacies and Clichés of Politics|url=http://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-freeman-ideas-on-liberty|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=The Freeman|date=Jan 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America |chapter=''Freeman'', 1950- |last=Hamilton |first=Charles H. |editor1-last=Lora |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Henry |editor2-first=William Longton (eds.) |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=0-313-21390-9 |oclc=40481045 |pages=321\u2013327}}</ref><ref name="Doherty198-199">{{cite book |title=[[Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement]] |last=Doherty |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |location=New York |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58648-572-6 |oclc=76141517 |pages=198\u2013199}}</ref>\u000a\u000aRead received an Honorary Doctoral Degree at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in 1976.
