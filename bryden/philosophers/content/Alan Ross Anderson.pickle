Formally, he captured this "[[relevance]] condition" with the principle that\u000a\u000a: ''A'' entails ''B'' only if ''A'' and ''B'' share at least one non-logical [[Logical constant|constant]].\u000a\u000aAs simple as this idea appears, implementing it in a [[formal system]] requires a radical departure from the [[semantics]] of [[classical logic]].  Anderson and Belnap (with contributions from [[J. Michael Dunn]], [[Kit Fine]], [[Alasdair Urquhart]], [[Robert K. Meyer]], [[Anil Gupta (philosopher)|Anil Gupta]], and others) explored the formal consequences of the relevance condition in great detail in their influential ''Entailment'' books (see references below), which are the most frequently cited works in the field of [[relevance logic]].\u000a\u000aAnderson and Belnap were quick to observe that the concept of relevance had been central to logic since [[Aristotle]], but had been unduly neglected since [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[George Boole]] laid the foundations for what would come to be known, somewhat ironically, as "classical" logic.  (For an example of classical logic's failure to satisfy the relevance condition, see the article on the [[principle of explosion]].)\u000a\u000a==Deontic logic ==\u000a\u000aAnderson advocated the view that sentences of the form "It ought to be (the case) that ''A''" should be interpreted logically as:\u000a\u000a* Not-''A'' entails '''v''',\u000a\u000awhere '''v''' means something like ''a [[Norm (philosophy)|norm]] has been violated''.  He developed systems of [[deontic logic|deontic]] relevance logic containing a special constant '''v''' (notation varies) for this purpose.  Such systems have sometimes been characterized as "reductions" of deontic logic to alethic modal logic.  This is misleading at best, however, since alethic modal logics generally do not contain anything like Anderson's special '''v''' constant.\u000a\u000a== Philosophy of logic ==\u000a\u000aAnderson was known for being a [[Platonist]] (or [[philosophical realism|realist]], or [[monist]]) about logic; he believed in "The One True Logic," and he believed that it was a ''relevance'' logic.\u000a\u000a==Resources==\u000a* Anderson, A.
