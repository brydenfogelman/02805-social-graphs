The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supra-mundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such "in conformity with the world"; omniscience, and the ability to "suppress karma".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a [[secularity|secular understanding]] of Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.\u000a\u000aAndrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:\u000a{{quote|It is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a ''mah\u0101puru\u1e63a'', "superman"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a [[Deva (Buddhism)|god]]; and in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta]]'' he states that he could live for an [[Kalpa (aeon)|aeon]] were he asked to do so.{{sfn|Skilton|2004|p=64-65}}}}\u000aThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life.

After nearly starving himself to death by restricting his food intake to around a leaf or nut per day, he collapsed in a river while bathing and almost drowned. Siddhartha was rescued by a village girl named Sujata and she gave him some [[payasam]] (a pudding made from milk and [[jaggery]]) after which Siddhartha got back some energy.

This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[V\u0101san\u0101]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.\u000a\u000a[[File:Vulturepeak1.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[Griddhraj Parvat|Vulture Peak]], where the [[Atanatiya Sutta]] was held]]\u000a\u000aThe first vassana was spent at [[Varanasi]] when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]], capital of [[Magadha]], to visit King [[Bimbisara]]. During this visit, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana]] were converted by [[Assaji]], one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, capital of Magadha.\u000a\u000aUpon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to Kapilavastu. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message, and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by Kaludayi, a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.\u000a\u000aNow two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:\u000a{{quote|"Ours is the warrior lineage of Mahamassata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms."}}\u000a\u000aThe Buddha is said to have replied:\u000a{{quote|"That is not the custom of your royal lineage. But it is the custom of my Buddha lineage. Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking alms."}}\u000a\u000aBuddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk. After this he is said to have become a [[sotapanna]]. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. The Buddha's cousins [[Ananda]] and [[Anuruddha]] became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son [[Rahula]] also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother [[Nanda (Buddhist)|Nanda]] also joined and became an arahant.\u000a\u000aOf the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, [[Maudgalyayana]], [[Mahakasyapa]], Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of [[Upali]], [[Subhoti]], Rahula, [[Mahakaccana]] and [[Punna]].\u000a\u000aIn the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near [[Vesali]] when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.\u000a\u000a[[File:The last days of buddha teachings.jpg|thumb|The last days of buddha teachings]]The king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother [[Maha Pajapati]], for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules ([[Vinaya]]) to follow.\u000a\u000a=== Mahaparinirvana ===\u000a[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Buddha Parinirvana.jpeg|thumb|The Buddha's entry into [[Parinirvana]].

These may reflect the different traditional views on [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] and the precepts for monks and nuns.\u000a\u000a[[Arthur Waley|Waley]] suggests that Theravadin's would take ''suukaramaddava'' (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as ''pig-soft'', to mean "soft flesh of a pig" or "pig's soft-food", that is, after [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]], a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a [[truffle]]. He argues (also after Neumann) that as "(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical", as there are several plants known to have ''suukara-'' (pig) as part of their names,<ref group = note name= "Wayley1932">Waley notes: ''suukara-kanda'', "pig-bulb"; ''suukara-paadika'', "pig's foot" and  ''sukaresh.ta''  "sought-out by pigs".  He cites Neumann's suggestion that if a plant called "sought-out by pigs" exists then ''suukaramaddava'' can mean "pig's delight".</ref> and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, ''suukaramaddava'' could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.{{sfn|Waley|1932|pp= 343\u201354}}\u000a\u000aAccording to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha died at Ku\u015bin\u0101ra (present-day [[Kushinagar]], India), which became a pilgrimage center.{{sfn |Huntington|1986|p=47}} Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of [[Kushinagar|Ku\u015bin\u0101ra]]  of the [[Malla (India)|Malla]] kingdom. The Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king and the appropriate place for him to die.{{sfn|Von Hinüber|2009|p=49}}\u000a\u000aThe Buddha then asked all the attendant [[Bhikkhu]]s to clarify any doubts or questions they had and cleared them all in a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: "All composite things ([[Sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]]) are perishable. Strive for your own liberation with diligence" (Pali: 'vayadhamm\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101 appam\u0101dena samp\u0101deth\u0101').

Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Therav\u0101da record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Therav\u0101da countries is 544 or 545 BCE, because the reign of Emperor A\u015boka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates.

''Anuppatta-sadattho'' (one who has reached the right goal) is also a vague positive expression in the Arhatformula in MN 35 (I p, 235), see chapter 2, footnote 3, Furthermore, ''satthi'' (welfare) is important in e.g. SN 2.12 or 2.17 or Sn 269; and ''sukha'' and ''rati'' (happiness), in contrast to other places, as used in Sn 439 and 956.
