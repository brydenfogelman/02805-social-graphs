Harding''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] philosopher of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist]] and [[post-colonialism|postcolonial theory]], [[epistemology]], research methodology, and [[philosophy of science]]. She taught for two decades at the [[University of Delaware]] before moving to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1996.  She directed the [[UCLA Center for the Study of Women]] from 1996 to 2000, and co-edited ''[[Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]'' from 2000 to 2005.  She is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education [http://gseis.ucla.edu/people/sharding] and Gender Studies [http://www.genderstudies.ucla.edu/people/faculty] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and a Distinguished Affiliate Professor of Philosophy at [[Michigan State University]][http://www.philosophy.msu.edu/people/faculty/sandraharding/]. In 2013 she was awarded the [[John Desmond Bernal Prize]] by the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science|Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S)]]. (Earlier recipients of this prize include [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], [[Thomas Kuhn|Thomas S. Kuhn]], [[Mary Douglas]], and [[Joseph Needham]].)\u000a\u000aShe has developed the research standard of \u201c[[strong objectivity]],\u201d and contributed to the articulation of [[standpoint theory|standpoint methodology]]. This kind of research process starts off from questions that arise in the daily lives of people in oppressed groups.  To answer such questions, it \u201cstudies up\u201d, examining the principles, practices and cultures of dominant institutions, from the design and management of which oppressed groups have been excluded. She has also contributed to the development of feminist, anti-racist, multicultural, and postcolonial studies of the natural and social sciences, asking the extent to which paradigms like [[feminist empiricism]] are useful for promoting to goals of feminist inquiry.  She is the author or editor of many books and essays on these topics, and was one of the founders of the fields of [[feminist epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]].  This work has been influential in the [[social science]]s and in [[women's studies|women]]/[[gender studies]] across the disciplines.  It has helped to create new kinds of discussions about how best to relink scientific research to pro-democratic goals.\u000a\u000aShe has been a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[University of Costa Rica]], the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology [http://www.ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/federal-institutes-technology], and the [[Asian Institute of Technology]].  She has been a consult to several [[United Nations]] organizations including the [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[UNESCO]], the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development [http://unctad.org/en/Pages/cstd.aspx], and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women|U.N. Development Fund for Women]]. [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] selected her as a national lecturer in 2007.  She has lectured at over 300 colleges, universities, and conferences, on five continents.<ref name="Sandra Harding's GSEIS Profile" />\u000a\u000aDuring what is known now as the "[[Science Wars]]", she was part of a debate regarding the value-neutrality of the sciences.
