At the same time he was exposed to many aspects of [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical]] and political thought. He attempted to explain and provide solutions for the problems faced by Muslim societies through traditional Islamic principles interwoven with and understood from the point of view of modern sociology and philosophy. His articles from this period for the Mashhad daily newspaper, ''Khorasan'', display his developing eclecticism and acquaintance with the ideas of modernist thinkers such as [[Jamal-al-Din Afghani|Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], [[Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal]] of Pakistan, among Muslims and [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alexis Carrel]].<ref>''An Islamic Utopian'', pp. 61\u201368.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1952, he became a high-school teacher and founded the Islamic Students' Association, which led to his arrest after a demonstration. In 1953, the year of [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Mossadeq's overthrow]], he became a member of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]]. He received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Mashhad]] in 1955. In 1957 he was arrested again by the Iranian  police, along with 16 other members of the National Resistance Movement.\u000a\u000aShariati then managed to obtain a scholarship for France, where he continued his graduate studies at Sorbonne University in [[Paris]]. He worked towards earning his doctorate in sociology, leaving Paris after getting a PhD certificate in sociology in 1964 from Sorbonne University. During this period in Paris, Shariati started collaborating with the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in 1959. The next year, he began to read [[Frantz Fanon]] and translated an anthology of his work into Persian.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/islamisme/dossier.asp?ida=436714 «La jeune génération est un enjeu»], interview with [[Gilles Kepel]] in ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 26 January 2006 {{fr icon}}</ref> Shariati would introduce Fanon's thought into Iranian revolutionary émigrée circles. He was arrested in Paris during a demonstration in honour of [[Patrice Lumumba]], on 17 January 1961.\u000a\u000aThe same year he joined [[Ebrahim Yazdi]], [[Mostafa Chamran]] and [[Sadegh Qotbzadeh]] in founding the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] abroad. In 1962, he continued studying sociology and [[history of religion]]s, and followed the courses of Islamic scholar [[Louis Massignon]], [[Jacques Berque]] and the sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]]. He also came to know the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] that same year, and published in Iran [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]]'s book ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' (or ''Occidentosis'').\u000a\u000aHe then returned to Iran in 1964 where he was arrested and imprisoned for engaging in subversive political activities while in France. He was released after a few weeks, at which point he began teaching at the University of [[Mashhad]].\u000a\u000aShariati then went to [[Tehran]] where he began lecturing at the [[Hosseiniye Ershad]] Institute. These lectures proved to be hugely popular among his students and were spread by word of mouth throughout all economic sectors of the society, including the middle and upper classes where interest in Shariati's teachings began to grow immensely.\u000a\u000aShariati's continued success again aroused the interest of the government, which arrested him, as well as many of his students. Widespread pressure from the populace and an international outcry eventually led to his release after eighteen months in solitary confinement, and he was released on 20 March 1975.\u000a\u000aShariati was allowed to leave the country for England. He died three weeks later in a [[Southampton]] hospital under 'mysterious circumstances' although in Ali Rahnema's biography of Shariati, he is said to have died of a fatal heart attack. Shariati is buried next to [[Sayyidah Zaynab]], the granddaughter  of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and the daughter of [[Ali|Hazrat Ali]] in Damascus, Syria, where Iranian pilgrims frequently visit.\u000a\u000a=== Views ===\u000a\u000a[[File:Shariati7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Ali Shariati''' and his family, one day after his release from prison.]]\u000a\u000aShariati developed a fully novel approach to Shiism and interpreted the religion in a revolutionary manner.<ref name=ostovar>{{cite web|last=Ostovar|first=Afshon P.|title=Guardians of the Islamic Revolution Ideology, Politics, and the Development of Military Power in Iran (1979\u20132009)|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/64683/afshon_1.pdf;jsessionid=DF7BFA33BF18FF73E9117CB0504F14E1?sequence=1|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=26 July 2013|format=PhD Thesis|date=2009}}</ref> His interpretation of Shiism encouraged revolution in the world and promised salvation after death.<ref name=milani>{{cite book|author=Abbas Milani|title=The Myth of the Great Satan: A New Look at America's Relations with Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTrRom48fhAC&pg=PA123|accessdate=1 August 2013|date=31 July 2010|publisher=Hoover Press|isbn=978-0-8179-1136-2|pages=122}}</ref> Shariati referred to his brand of Shiism as [[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism|"red Shiism"]] which he contrasted with clerical-dominated, unrevolutionary [[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism|"black Shiism"]] or [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid Shiism]].<ref>Ali Shariati, "[[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism]]".</ref> His ideas have been compared to the Catholic [[Liberation Theology]] movement founded in South America by [[Peru]]vian [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Brazil]]ian [[Leonardo Boff]].<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 129</ref>\u000a\u000aShariati was a prominent Islamist philosopher who argued that a good society would conform to Islamic values; he suggested that the role of government was to guide society in the best possible manner rather than manage society in the best possible manner.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evSkdzXF_4</ref> Shariati believed that the most learned members of the Ulema (clergy) should play a leadership role in guiding society because they best understand how to administer an Islamic value system based on the teachings of the Prophets of God and the 12 Shia [[Twelver]] Imams.<ref name="youtube.com">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RjiWLcuyQA</ref> He argued that the role of the clergy was to guide society in accordance with Islamic values to advance human beings towards reaching their highest potential\u2014not to provide/serve the hedonistic desires of individuals as in the West.<ref name="youtube.com"/>\u000a\u000aShariati's works were highly influenced by the [[Third Worldism]] that he encountered as a student in Paris\u2014ideas that [[class conflict|class war]] and revolution would bring about a just and [[classless society]]\u2014from one side, and the epistemic [[Decolonization]] thinking of his time from the other side. He is said to have adopted the idea of ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' from [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]] and given it "its most vibrant and influential second life."<ref>Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', p. 330</ref>\u000a\u000aHe sought to translate these ideas into cultural symbols of Shiism that Iranians could relate to. He believed Shia should not merely await the return of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|12th Imam]] but should actively work to hasten his return by fighting for [[social justice]], "even to the point of embracing [[martyrdom]]", saying "everyday is [[Ashoura]], every place is [[Battle of Karbala|Karbala]]."<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 128\u20139</ref> Shariati had a dynamic view about Islam. His ideology about Islam is closely related to [[Muhammad Iqbal|Allama Iqbal]]'s ideology; for example, according to both intellectuals, change is the greatest law of nature and Islam.\u000a====Epistemology====\u000a\u000aShariati developed the idea of the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge in sociology. Shariati believed in the earthly religion and in social context in which meaning of society construed. Also he emphasized that he understands the religion historically because he is a sociologist. As he said he concerned with the historical and social tawhid not with the truth of the exalted book of Quran or Muhammad or Ali.<ref>Behrooz Ghamari-Tabrizi, Abdolkarim Soroush,The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics, Edited by John L.
