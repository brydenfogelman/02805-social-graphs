She obtained a PhD in Hispanic Literatures ([[State University of New York, Stony Brook]], 1980) and has taught at [[Rutgers University]], [[City University of New York]], and [[Colgate University]], where she served as a Distinguished Chair of Creative Writing (1997). She was a foreign correspondent for ''Grazie'' magazine (2001\u20132002).\u000a\u000aAs an adolescent in San Juan, Giannina Braschi ranked first place in the U.S. [[Tennis]] Association's national tournament in Puerto Rico, becoming the youngest female [[tennis]] player to win the Women's Division (1966) on the island. Her father Euripides ("Pilo") Braschi was also a tennis champion. She was also a founding member of the [[San Juan Children's Choir]] ("Coro de niños de San Juan") under music director Evy Lucio and a fashion model during her teen years.<ref>Díaz, Carmen Graciela, El Nuevo Dia, "Avion, sol y libertad," November 17, 2011 [http://www.elnuevodia.com/avion,solylibertad-1122361.html]</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the 1980s, Braschi's early writings were scholarly in nature and focused on the titans of the [[Spanish Golden Age]], as well as the vanguard poets of Latin America and Spain. She published a book on the Romantic poet [[Gustavo Adolfo Becquer]] and essays on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]], [[César Vallejo]], [[Juan Ramon Jimenez]] and [[Federico García Lorca]]. She later became obsessed with the dramatic and philosophical works of French, German, Polish, Irish, and Russian authors. Though categorized as novels, her later mixed-genre works are experimental in style and format and celebratory of foreign influences.<ref>Braschi, Giannina, "What to Read Now: Mixed-Genre Literature", World Literature Today, September\u2013October 2012 [http://www.worldliteraturetoday.com/2012/september/what-read-now-mixed-genre-literature-giannina-braschi]</ref> In the 50th anniversary edition of [[Evergreen Review]], Braschi notes that she considers herself "more French than [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]", and believes that she is the "granddaughter of [[Alfred Jarry]] and [[Antonin Artaud]], bastard child of [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[James Joyce]], half-sister to [[Heiner Müller]], kissing cousin of [[Tadeusz Kantor]], and lover of Witkiewicz".<ref>''The Evergreen Review's 50th Anniversary Edition'', (www.evergreenreview.com), Giannina Braschi, 2007.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Pivotal works==\u000aIn the 1980s, Giannina Braschi burst onto the downtown [[Nuyorican]] poetry scene with [[spoken word]] performances of rhythmic intensity, humorous gusto, and anti-imperialistic politics. Her [[prose poem]]s were written, recited, and published entirely in Spanish during this period. Her first collection of Spanish [[prose poetry]], ''Asalto al tiempo'', debuted in Barcelona in 1980 and was followed by ''La Comedia profana'' in 1985 and ''El imperio de los sueños'' in 1988. New York is the site and subject of much of her work. In a climatic episode of "[[Pastoral]] or the Inquisition of Memories", shepherds invade [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] on the [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]] and take over the City of New York; the shepherds ring the bells of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] and seize the observation deck of the [[Empire State Building]].\u000a\u000aPoet and feminist scholar [[Alicia Ostriker]] has praised [[Braschi's Empire of Dreams]], which features gender role-playing and [[transvestism]], for having "sheer erotic energy that defies definition and dogma."<ref>Introduction to Giannina [[Braschi's Empire of Dreams]], [[Alicia Ostriker]], Yale University Press, New Haven, 1994.</ref> "Those three award winning books were published together as the inaugural volume of the Yale Library of Literature in Translation."
