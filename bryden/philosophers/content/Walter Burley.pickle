He received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1301, and was a [[fellow]] of [[Merton College]] Oxford until about 1310.  He then spent sixteen years in Paris, becoming a fellow of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] by 1324, before spending 17 years as a clerical courtier in England and [[Avignon]].  Burley disagreed with [[William of Ockham]] on a number of points concerning logic and [[natural philosophy]]. He died in about 1344.\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aBurley was born in 1274 or 1275, possibly in [[Burley-in-Wharfedale]], [[Yorkshire]], or in [[Burley, Leeds|Burley]] near [[Leeds]].{{r|ODNB}}  Little is known of his early life.  He was made rector of [[Welbury]] in Yorkshire in 1309, probably through the influence of Sir John de Lisle, a friend of [[William Greenfield]].{{sfnp|Ottman|Wood|1999|p=9}}  As throughout his career, he did not act as rector, employing a substitute and using the income from the living to finance his study in Paris, where he completed his lectures on Peter Lombard's ''[[Sentences]]'', and probably encountered the work of his contemporary [[William of Ockham]].  Burley's commentary on the ''Sentences'' has not survived.{{sfnp|Ottman|Wood|1999|p=10}}\u000a\u000a==Political career==\u000aBurley became a courtier during the political events that followed the deposition of [[Edward II]] of England in 1327. His first assignment was to try and obtain the [[canonisation]] of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], who had been one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Edward II; Thomas had become venerated as a [[martyr]] within a few months of his death. Burley was sent to the [[Avignon Papacy|papal court at Avignon]] to appeal directly to [[Pope John XXII]].  By coincidence, William of Ockham was also staying at Avignon, having been summoned there in 1324 to answer charges of possibly heretical statements (by 1326 there was a list of 51 charges against him).\u000a\u000aBurley's associates were all closely involved in these attempts at canonisation (none of which was successful).  One was [[Richard de Bury]], a bibliophile and patron of the arts and sciences, who became Burley's patron and at whose request Bury translated some works of [[Aristotle]] into English.{{r|Denholm}}\u000a\u000a==Ecclesiastical career==\u000aBurley had become a master of theology by 1324. In May 1327 he became canon of Chichester by the provision of the pope, but exchanged the position in 1332 to become canon at [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]], where de Bury was [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]].  Bury had been involved in the coup d'état of 1330 that resulted in the execution of Mortimer, and the de facto accession of Edward III to the throne. In 1333 de Bury was consecrated [[Bishop of Durham]] by the king, over-ruling the choice of the monks, who had elected and actually installed their sub-prior, [[Robert de Graynes]].<ref name=Handbook242>Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 242</ref> In February 1334 de Bury was made Lord Treasurer, an appointment he exchanged later in the year for that of Lord Chancellor.  He gathered together a group of intellectuals including [[Thomas Fitzralph]], [[Richard Kilvington|Richard de Kilvington]], [[Robert Holcot]]t, [[Thomas Bradwardine]] and Burley himself.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000aBurley was one of the first logicians to recognise the priority of the [[propositional logic|propositional calculus]] over the [[first-order logic|predicate calculus]], despite the fact that the latter had been the main focus of logicians until then.  Burley also seems to have been the only 14th-century logician to have taken the position that, in line with modern views on the [[material conditional]], the principle that "from the impossible anything follows" ("''ex impossibili sequitur quidlibet''") is both a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for explaining the logical relationship between [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]].{{sfnp|Jacobi|1993|p=162}}\u000aHe was also known for his commentaries on Aristotle's [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']], which include the quodlibet ''De Primo et ultimo instanti'' (around 1320) and the longer work ''Expositio in libros octo de physico auditu''.{{r|Sylla}}\u000aBurley wrote 39 Commentaries on Aristotle and 32 Treatises and Questions (many unedited) <ref>Marta Vittorini, ''Appendix: A Complete List of Burley's Works'', in A.

This book is known to have been written after Ockham's ''[[Summa Logicae]]'' (c. 1323), possibly partly in response to it.{{sfnp|Böhner|1952|p=44}}\u000aOther works include:{{efn|The ''Liber de vita et moribus philosophorum'', once attributed to Burley, is by an anonymous author.}}\u000a* ''In Aristotelis Perihermenias'' (''Questions on Aristotle's Perihermenias'', 1301)\u000a* ''De consequentiis'' (1302)\u000a* ''De exclusivis'' (1302)\u000a* ''De exceptivis'' (1302)\u000a* ''De Suppositions'' (1302)\u000a* ''De ente'' (ca. 1310)\u000a* ''De qualitatibus'' (ca. 1310)\u000a* ''Expositio super libros De Anima'' (after 1310)\u000a* ''Tractatus de formis'' (1324-1326)\u000a* ''Tractatus de universalibus'' (after 1337)\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a'''Notes'''\u000a{{notelist|notes}}\u000a\u000a'''Citations'''\u000a{{reflist|30em|refs=\u000a\u000a<ref name="Denholm">\u000a{{citation |jstor=3678596 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |last=Denholm-Young |first=N. |pages=135\u2013168 |volume=20 (Fourth series) |year=1937 |title=Richard de Bury (1287\u20131345)}}\u000a</ref>\u000a\u000a<ref name="ODNB">\u000a{{citation |last=Sommers |first=M.
