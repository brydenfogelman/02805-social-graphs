He then embarked on a career as a political journalist in Paris. From 1932 to 1940 he was editor of the mainstream, conservative daily the "Journal des débats".  Early in the 1930s he contributed to a series of radical nationalist magazines, while also serving as editor of the fiercely anti-German daily "Le rempart" in 1933 and as editor of Paul Lévy's anti-Nazi polemical weekly "Aux écoutes". In 1936 and 1937 he also contributed to the far right monthly "Combat" and to the nationalist-syndicalist daily "L'Insurgé", which eventually ceased publication \u2013 largely as a result of Blanchot's intervention \u2013 because of the anti-semitism of some of its collaborators. There is no dispute that Blanchot was nevertheless the author of a series of violently polemical articles attacking the government of the day and its confidence in the politics of the League of Nations, and warned persistently against the threat to peace in Europe posed by Nazi Germany.\u000a\u000aIn December 1940, he met [[Georges Bataille]], who had written strong anti-fascist articles in the thirties, and who would remain a close friend until his death in 1962. Blanchot worked in Paris during the Nazi occupation. In order to support his family, he continued to work as a book reviewer for the Journal des débats from 1941 to 1944, writing for instance about such figures as Sartre and Camus, Bataille and Michaux, Mallarmé and Duras for a putatively Pétainist readership. In these reviews he laid the foundations for later French critical thinking, by examining the ambiguous rhetorical nature of language, and the irreducibility of the written word to notions of truth or falsity. He refused the editorship of the collaborationist ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'', for which, as part of an elaborate ploy, he had been suggested by [[Jean Paulhan]].  He remained a bitter opponent of the fascist, anti-semitic novelist and journalist [[Robert Brasillach]], who was the principal leader of the pro-Nazi collaborationist movement, and was active in the Resistance. In June 1944, Blanchot was almost executed by a Nazi firing squad (as recounted in his text ''The Instant of My Death'').\u000a\u000a===Post-1945===\u000aAfter the war Blanchot began working only as a novelist and literary critic.  In 1947, Blanchot left Paris for the secluded village of [[Èze]] in the south of France, where he spent the next decade of his life. Like [[Sartre]] and other French intellectuals of the era, Blanchot avoided the academy as a means of livelihood, instead relying on his pen. Importantly, from 1953 to 1968, he published regularly in ''Nouvelle Revue Française''. At the same time, he began a lifestyle of relative isolation, often not seeing close friends (like [[Levinas]]) for years, while continuing to write lengthy letters to them. Part of the reason for his self-imposed isolation (and only part of it \u2013 his isolation was closely connected to his writing and is often featured among his characters) was the fact that, for most of his life, Blanchot suffered from poor health.\u000a\u000aBlanchot's political activities after the war shifted to the left.  He is widely credited with being one of the main authors of the important "[[Manifesto of the 121]]", named after the number of its signatories, who included [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Robert Antelme]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[René Char]], [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Simone Signoret]] and others, which supported the rights of conscripts to refuse the draft in [[Algeria]]. The manifesto was crucial to the intellectual response to the war.\u000a\u000aIn May 1968, Blanchot once again emerged from personal obscurity, in support of the student protests.  It was his sole public appearance after the war. Yet for fifty years he remained a consistent champion of modern literature and its tradition in French letters. During the later years of his life, he repeatedly wrote against the intellectual attraction to fascism, and notably against [[Heidegger]]'s post-war silence over the [[Holocaust]].\u000a\u000aBlanchot wrote more than thirty works of fiction, literary criticism, and philosophy. Up to the 1970s, he worked continually in his writing to break the barriers between what are generally perceived as different "genres" or "tendencies", and much of his later work moves freely between narration and philosophical investigation.\u000a\u000aIn 1983, Blanchot published ''La Communauté inavouable'' (''The Unavowable Community''). This work inspired ''The Inoperative Community'' (1986),<ref>See [https://lectures.revues.org/16166 ''Jean-Luc Nancy, La communauté désavouée'' at Lectures - Revues.org].</ref> [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]'s attempt to approach community in a non-religious, non-utilitarian and un-political exegesis.\u000a\u000aHe died on 20 February 2003 in [[Le Mesnil-Saint-Denis]], Yvelines, France.\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000aBlanchot's work is not a coherent, all-encompassing 'theory', since it is a work founded on [[paradox]] and impossibility.  The thread running through all his writing is the constant engagement with the 'question of literature', a simultaneous enactment and interrogation of the profoundly strange experience of writing.  For Blanchot, 'literature begins at the moment when literature becomes a question' (''Literature and the Right to Death'').<ref>Maurice Blanchot (1995) 'Literature and the Right to Death' in ''The Work of Fire''. C. Mandel (trans). Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 300.</ref>\u000a\u000aBlanchot draws on the work of the symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] in formulating his conception of [[literary language]] as anti-realist and distinct from everyday experience. 'I say flower,' Mallarmé writes in ''Poetry in Crisis'', 'and outside the oblivion to which my voice relegates any shape, insofar as it is something other than the [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]], there arises musically, as the very idea and delicate, the one absent from every bouquet.'<ref>''Stephane Mallarmé: Selected Poetry and Prose'' (1982) Mary Ann Cawes (ed). New York: New Directions. p. 75.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the everyday use of language, words are the vehicles of ideas. The word 'flower' means flower that refers to flowers in the world. No doubt it is possible to read literature in this way, but literature is more than this everyday use of language. For in literature 'flower' does not just mean flower but many things and it can only do so because the word is independent from what it signifies. This independence, which is passed over in the everyday use of language, is the negativity at the heart of language. The word means something because it negates the physical reality of the thing. Only in this way can the idea arise. The absence of the thing is made good by the presence of the idea. What the everyday use of language steps over to make use of the idea, literature remains fascinated by, the absence that makes it possible. Literary language, therefore, is a double negation, both of the thing and the idea. It is in this space that literature becomes possible where words take on a strange and mysterious reality of their own, and where also meaning and reference remain allusive and ambiguous.\u000a\u000aBlanchot's best-known fictional works are ''Thomas l'Obscur'' (''Thomas the Obscure''), an unsettling ''[[récit]]'' ("[''récit''] is not the narration of an event, but that event itself, the approach to that event, the place where that event is made to happen")<ref>Maurice Blanchot, "The Song of the Sirens" (1959).</ref> about the experience of reading and loss; ''Death Sentence''; ''Aminadab'' and ''The Most High'' (about a bureaucrat in a totalitarian state). His central theoretical works are "Literature and the Right to Death" (in ''The Work of Fire'' and ''The Gaze of Orpheus''), ''The Space of Literature'', ''The Infinite Conversation'', and ''The Writing of the Disaster''.\u000a\u000a===Themes===\u000aBlanchot engages with [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] on the question of the philosopher's death, showing how literature and death are both experienced as anonymous passivity, an experience that Blanchot variously refers to as "the Neutral" (''le neutre''). Unlike Heidegger, Blanchot rejects the possibility of an authentic relation to death, because he rejects the possibility of death, that is to say of the individual's experience of death. He thus rejects, in total, the possibility of understanding and "properly" engaging with it; and this resonates with [[Levinas]]' take too.\u000a\u000aBlanchot also draws heavily from [[Franz Kafka]], and his fictional work (like his theoretical work) is shot through with an engagement with Kafka's writing.\u000a\u000aBlanchot's work was also strongly influenced by his friends [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].  Blanchot's later work in particular is influenced by Levinasian ethics and the question of responsibility to [[Other|the Other]]. On the other hand, Blanchot's own literary works, like the famous ''Thomas the Obscure'', heavily influenced Levinas's and Bataille's ideas about the possibility that our vision of reality is blurred because of the use of words (thus making everything you perceive automatically as abstract as words are). This search for the 'real' reality is illustrated by the works of [[Paul Celan]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].\u000a\u000aThe main intellectual biography of Blanchot is by Christophe Bident: ''Maurice Blanchot, partenaire invisible''.\u000a\u000a== Principal works==\u000a===Principally fiction or narrations (''récits'')===\u000a*''Thomas l'Obscur'', 1941 (Thomas the Obscure)\u000a* ''Aminadab'', 1942\u000a*''[[L'Arrêt de mort]]'', 1948 (Death Sentence)\u000a*''Le Très-Haut'', 1949 (The Most High)\u000a*''Le Pas au-delà'', 1973 (The Step Not Beyond)\u000a*''La Folie du jour'', 1973 (The Madness of the Day)\u000a*''L'Instant de ma mort'', 1994 (The Instant of My Death)\u000a\u000a===Principally theoretical or philosophical works===\u000a*''Faux Pas'', 1943\u000a*''La Part du feu'', 1949 (The Work of Fire)\u000a*''L'Espace littéraire'', 1955 (The Space of Literature \u2013 main theoretical work)\u000a*''Le Livre à venir'', 1959 (The Book to Come)\u000a*''L'Entretien infini'', 1969 (The Infinite Conversation)\u000a*''L'Amitié'', 1971 (Friendship)\u000a*''L'Ecriture du désastre'', 1980 (The Writing of the Disaster)\u000a*''La Communauté inavouable'', 1983 (The Unavowable Community)\u000a*''Une voix venue d'ailleurs'', 2002 (A Voice from Elsewhere)\u000a*''Lautréamont and Sade''.
