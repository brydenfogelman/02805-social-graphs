V{{BLP sources|date=August 2009}}\u000a'''James Brusseau''' is a [[philosopher]] specializing in contemporary [[Continental philosophy]], [[history of philosophy]] and [[ethics]].<ref>http://www.sunypress.edu/p-2706-isolated-experiences.aspx</ref> In 1994 Brusseau joined the faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the [[UNAM|Mexican National University]] in Mexico City teaching graduate courses in Philosophy and Comparative Literature. He has also taught in Europe and the [[California State University]]. Currently he teaches at Pace University in New York City.<ref>https://eportfolio.pace.edu/user/view.php?id=13707</ref> Brusseau took a Ph.D. in Philosophy under the direction of [[Alphonso Lingis]]. He is married to a Spaniard and has two children.\u000a\u000a== Scholarship ==\u000aBrusseau\u2019s scholarship focuses on philosophical decadence, which he defines as philosophers stepping aside from the task of making accurate theories about the larger world, and instead endeavoring to produce theories that in their turn provoke more theorizing. Within this framework, whether a philosopher is actually right about things becomes a secondary or derivative concern. The guiding purpose is to provoke more strictly philosophical discussion and study. As a result, the best philosophical idea directly equals the one producing the most subsequent philosophizing.\u000a\u000aBrusseau attempts to locate decadence in the history of philosophy at [[Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s]] appropriation by recent French philosophers including [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].  He calls the moment a \u201creversal\u201d in philosophy\u2019s history, one where thought no longer exists to pursue truth, instead, truths exist to serve and accelerate thinking.<ref>https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739109434</ref>\u000a\u000aIt is unclear from Brusseau\u2019s published work and lectures whether he considers this development to be negative, neutral or positive.\u000a\u000aBrusseau's ''Business Ethics Workshop''<ref>http://www.flatworldknowledge.com//node/233286</ref> is a textbook in business ethics. He focuses on philosophical approaches to the corporation\u2019s role in society, and ethical questions arising around branding and the creation of product reputation. The fabrication of consumer needs and consumer identity is also considered.<ref>http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/Brusseau-Podcast</ref>\u000a\u000a== Literature ==\u000aBrusseau's novel ''Empire of Humiliation'' is set in Mexico City.<ref>http://jefffarias.podbean.com/2009/09/23/</ref>\u000a\u000a== Books ==\u000a* ''Isolated Experiences'', [[State University of New York Press]], 1996\u000a* ''Decadence of the French Nietzsche'', [[Rowman & Littlefield]], 2004\u000a* ''Empire of Humiliation'', Overflow, 2008\u000a* ''Business Ethics Workshop'', [[Flat World Knowledge]], 2011\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Brusseau, James}}\u000a[[Category:1964 births]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:21st-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Continental philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Postmodern theory]]\u000a[[Category:Post-structuralism]]\u000a[[Category:History of philosophy]]
