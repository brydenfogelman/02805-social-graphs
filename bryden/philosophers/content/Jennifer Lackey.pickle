In 2000, she graduated from [[Brown University]] with a Ph.D. in philosophy under the supervision of [[Ernest Sosa]].\u000a\u000a==Research areas==\u000aLackey\u2019s primary research interests lie in [[social epistemology]].<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=epistemology-social |title=Social Epistemology |author= |date=}}</ref> She is known for arguing against the traditional view of testimony, according to which testimony is a merely transmissive, rather than a generative, epistemic source. On this view, hearers can acquire [[knowledge]] on the basis of testimony only if the speakers themselves possess the knowledge in question and thus testimony transmits knowledge from one person to another without being able to generate knowledge in its own right. In ''Learning from Words: Testimony as a Source of Knowledge'', Lackey uses her widely discussed [[Creationism|creationist]] teacher case <ref>[http://philpapers.org/rec/CAROTA-5 J. Adam Carter & Philip J. Nickel, On Testimony and Transmission - PhilPapers]</ref><ref>http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~peterg/Peter%20Graham%20Can%20Testimony%20Generate%20Knowledge.pdf</ref> to argue that the standard view is false and that testimony can in fact be generative. In this case, a creationist teacher rejects all of the [[empirical evidence|evidence]] supporting [[evolutionary theory]] and thus fails to either believe or know that modern day [[Homo sapiens]] evolved from [[Homo erectus]], but nevertheless reliably conveys this fact about Homo sapiens to her students. This shows that the teacher imparts knowledge to her students that she fails to possess herself. Lackey then advances a theory of the epistemology of testimony that focuses on the linguistic or communicative items in testimonial exchanges, such as statements and other acts of communication, rather than the internal states of speakers, such as states of knowing and believing.\u000a\u000aIn other work, Lackey argues that [[reason]]ableness, rather than knowledge, is the norm of assertion,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cVM1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193&dq=john+turri+you+gotta+believe&source=bl&ots=y04D79Zr-A&sig=jNaTktV9OgMTiC9nWo9XzI_UAiw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ru1PU7nrJ8K0yAGR4YHYDQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=john%20turri%20you%20gotta%20believe&f=false Epistemic Norms: New Essays on Action, Belief, and Assertion - Google Books]</ref> that memory is a generative epistemic source,<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00009.x/full Preserving Preservationism: A Reply to Lackey - SENOR - 2007 - Philosophy and Phenomenological Research - Wiley Online Library]</ref><ref>{{PhilPapers|rec|NAYJAF|Andrew Naylor, Justification and Forgetting - PhilPapers}}</ref> and that lying requires deception.<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/3819041/Lies_and_Deception_A_Failed_Reconciliation Lies and Deception: A Failed Reconciliation | Fernando Broncano-Berrocal - Academia.edu]</ref>\u000a\u000aLackey is also known for arguing against the claim central to virtue epistemology that knowledge should be understood in terms of the knower\u2019s deserving credit for the truth of her belief.<ref>[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-008-9342-6#page-1 Two problems of easy credit - Springer]</ref> Lackey argues that the virtue epistemologist faces a dilemma: either the standards for deserving credit for a true belief are relatively high, or they are relatively low. If they are relatively high, then the virtue epistemologist cannot account for instances of knowledge from testimony, where the credit for the hearer\u2019s true belief goes to the speaker. On the other hand, if the standards are relatively low, then the virtue epistemologist cannot distinguish between cases of genuine knowledge and [[Gettier problem|Gettier cases]] where a person has a [[justified true belief]] by accident.\u000a\u000a==Awards and fellowships==\u000aLackey has received a number of awards, including a Charles A.
