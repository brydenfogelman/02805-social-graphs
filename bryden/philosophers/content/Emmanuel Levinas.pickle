After the Second World War, he studied the [[Talmud]] under the enigmatic "[[Monsieur Chouchani]]", whose influence he acknowledged only late in his life.\u000a\u000aBecause of the disruptions of [[World War I]], the family moved to [[Charkow]] in [[Ukraine]] in 1916. While living in Ukraine he witnessed the Russian revolutions of February and October 1917. In 1920 his family returned to Lithuania.\u000a\u000aLevinas began his philosophical studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in 1924, where he began his lifelong friendship with the French philosopher [[Maurice Blanchot]]. In 1928, he went to the [[University of Freiburg]] for two semesters to study [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] under [[Edmund Husserl]]. At [[Freiburg]] he also met [[Martin Heidegger]]. Levinas would in the early 1930s be one of the very first French intellectuals to draw attention to Heidegger and Husserl by translating in 1931 Husserl's ''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'' (with the help of Gabrielle Peiffer<!--[sic]--> and with advice from [[Alexandre Koyré]]) and by drawing on their ideas in his own philosophy, in works such as ''{{lang|fr|La théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl}}'' (''The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology''; his 1929/30<!--[sic]--> [[doctoral thesis]]), ''{{lang|fr|De l'Existence à l'Existant}}'' (''From Existence to Existents''; 1947), and ''{{lang|fr|En Découvrant l\u2019Existence avec Husserl et Heidegger}}'' (''Discovering Existence with Husserl and Heidegger''; first edition, 1949, with additions, 1967). In 1929 he was awarded his doctorate (''[[Doctorat d'université]]'' degree) by the University of Strasbourg for his thesis on the meaning of intuition in the philosophy of Husserl, published in 1930.\u000a\u000aLevinas became a naturalized French citizen in 1931. When France declared war on Germany, he was ordered to report for military duty. During the German invasion of France in 1940, his military unit was quickly surrounded and forced to surrender. Levinas spent the rest of [[World War II]] as a prisoner of war in a camp near [[Hannover]] in [[Germany]]. Levinas was assigned to a special barrack for Jewish prisoners, who were forbidden any form of religious worship. Life in the camp was as difficult as might be expected, with Levinas often forced to chop wood and do other menial tasks. Other prisoners saw him frequently jotting in a notebook. These jottings were later developed into his book ''De l'Existence à l'Existent'' (1947) and a series of lectures published under the title ''Le Temps et l'Autre'' (1948). His wartime notebooks have now been published in their original form as ''\u0152uvres: Tome 1, Carnets de captivité: suivi de Écrits sur la captivité ; et, Notes philosophiques diverses'' (2009).\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, [[Maurice Blanchot]] helped Levinas's wife and daughter spend the war in a monastery, thus sparing them from the Holocaust. Blanchot, at considerable personal risk, also saw to it that Levinas was able to keep in contact with his immediate family through letters and other messages. Other members of Levinas's family were not so fortunate; his mother-in-law was deported and never heard from again, while his father and brothers were killed in Lithuania by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/#LifCar Life and Career]</ref>\u000a\u000aLevinas's first book-length essay, ''[[Totality and Infinity]]'' (1961), was written as his ''[[Doctorat d'État]]'' primary thesis (roughly equivalent to a [[Habilitation]] thesis). His secondary thesis was titled ''Études sur la phénoménologie'' (''Studies on Phenomenology'').<ref name="Schrift p. 159">Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 159.</ref> After earning his habilitation, Levinas taught at a private Jewish High School in Paris, the {{ill|fr|École normale Israélite orientale (Paris)}}, eventually becoming its director. He began teaching at the [[University of Poitiers]] in 1961, at the Nanterre campus of the [[University of Paris]] in 1967, and at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1973, from which he retired in 1979. He was also a Professor at the [[University of Fribourg]] in [[Switzerland]]. In 1989 he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] for Philosophy.\u000a\u000aAccording to his [[obituary]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref name="Levinas's obituary">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E3DA1139F934A15751C1A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Levinas's obituary]</ref> Levinas came to regret his enthusiasm for Heidegger, because of the latter's affinity for the [[Nazis]]. During a lecture on forgiveness, Levinas stated, "One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger."<ref>Levinas, Emmanuel. ''Nine Talmudic Readings'', trans. Annette Aronowicz. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. p. 25</ref> \u000a \u000aHis son is the composer [[Michaël Levinas]]. Among his most famous students is Rabbi Baruch Garzon from Tetouan (Morocco), who learnt Philosophy with Levinas at the Sorbonne, and later went on to become one of the most important Rabbis of the Spanish-speaking world.\u000a\u000a==Philosophy==\u000aIn the 1950s, Levinas emerged from the circle of intellectuals surrounding [[Jean Wahl]] as a leading French thinker. His work is based on the [[ethics]] of [[Other|the Other]] or, in Levinas's terms, on "ethics as first philosophy". For Levinas, the Other is not knowable and cannot be made into an object of the self, as is done by traditional [[metaphysics]] (which Levinas called "[[ontology]]"). Levinas prefers to think of philosophy as the "wisdom of love" rather than the love of wisdom (the literal Greek meaning of the word "philosophy"). In his view, responsibility precedes any "objective searching after truth".\u000a\u000aLevinas derives the primacy of his ethics from the experience of the encounter with the Other. For Levinas, the irreducible relation, the epiphany, of the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]], the encounter with another, is a privileged [[phenomenon]] in which the other person's proximity and distance are both strongly felt. "The Other precisely ''reveals'' himself in his [[alterity]] not in a shock negating the I, but as the primordial phenomenon of gentleness."<ref>E. Levinas, ''[[Totality and Infinity]]: An Essay on Exteriority'' ([[Alphonso Lingis]], transl. Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), p. 150.</ref> At the same time, the revelation of the face makes a demand, this demand is before one can express, or know one's freedom, to affirm or deny.<ref>For recent reflections on the ethical-political imports of Levinas's tradition (and biography), along with the examination of the notion of the ''face-to-face'' in relation to ''le visage'', while taking into account the Levantine/Palestinian standpoint on conflict, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "Uneasy Meditations Following Levinas," ''Studia Phaenomelnologica'', Vol. 6 (2006), pp. 293\u2013315</ref> One instantly recognizes the transcendence and heteronomy of the Other. Even murder fails as an attempt to take hold of this otherness.\u000a\u000aWhile critical of traditional theology, Levinas does require that a "trace" of the Divine be acknowledged within an ethics of Otherness. This is especially evident in his thematization of debt and guilt. "A face is a trace of itself, given over to my responsibility, but to which I am wanting and faulty. It is as though I were responsible for his mortality, and guilty for surviving."<ref>Emmanuel Levinas, ''Otherwise than Being'', trans. A. Lingis (Dordrecht: Nijhoff, 1974), p. 91.</ref> The moral "authority" of the face of the Other is felt in my "infinite responsibility" for the Other.<ref>Levinas, Entre Nous, trans. M. B. Smith & B. Harshav (New York: Columbia, 1998), p. 74.</ref> The face of the Other comes toward me with its infinite moral demands while emerging out of the trace. Apart from this morally imposing emergence, the Other\u2019s face might well be adequately addressed as "Thou" (along the lines proposed by [[Martin Buber]]) in whose welcoming countenance I might find great comfort, love and communion of souls\u2014but not a moral demand bearing down upon me from a height. "Through a trace the irreversible past takes on the profile of a \u2018He.\u2019 The beyond from which a face comes is in the third person."<ref>Levinas, "The Trace of the Other," in ''Deconstruction in Context'', ed. M. Taylor (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), p. 356.</ref> It is because the Other also emerges out of the ''illeity'' of a He (''il'' in French) that I instead fall into infinite debt vis-à-vis the Other in a situation of utterly asymmetrical obligations: I owe the Other everything, the Other owes me nothing. The trace of the Other is the heavy shadow of God, the God who commands, "[[Thou shalt not kill]]!"<ref>Levinas, ''Difficult Freedom'', trans. S. Hand (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1990), p. 8f..</ref> Levinas takes great pains to avoid straightforward theological language.<ref>"A face does not function in proximity as a sign of a hidden God who would impose the neighbor on me." ''Otherwise than Being'', p. 94.</ref> The very metaphysics of signification subtending theological language is suspected and suspended by evocations of how traces work differently than signs. Nevertheless, the divinity of the trace is also undeniable: "the trace is not just one more word: it is the proximity of God in the countenance of my fellowman."<ref>Levinas, ''Entre Nous'', p. 57.</ref> In a sense, it is divine commandment without divine authority.\u000a\u000aFollowing ''[[Totality and Infinity]]'', Levinas later argued that responsibility for the other is rooted within our subjective constitution. It should be noted that the first line of the preface of this book is "everyone will readily agree that it is of the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality."<ref>E. Levinas, ''[[Totality and Infinity]]: An Essay on Exteriority'' ([[Alphonso Lingis]], transl. Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), p. 21.</ref> This idea appears in his of recurrence (chapter 4 in ''[[Otherwise than Being]]''), in which Levinas maintains that subjectivity is formed in and through our subjection to the other. Subjectivity, Levinas argued, is primordially ethical, not theoretical: that is to say, our responsibility for the other is not a derivative feature of our subjectivity, but instead, ''founds'' our subjective being-in-the-world by giving it a meaningful direction and orientation. Levinas's thesis "ethics as first philosophy", then, means that the traditional philosophical pursuit of knowledge is secondary to a basic ethical duty to the other. To meet the Other is to have the idea of Infinity.<ref>French: "''Aborder Autrui [...] c'est donc recevoir d'Autrui au-delà de la capacité du Moi: ce qui signifie exactement: avoir l'idée de l'infini.''" in ''Totalité et Infini'', Martinus Nijhoff, La Haye, 1991, p. 22.</ref>\u000a\u000aThe elderly Levinas was a distinguished French public intellectual, whose books reportedly sold well. He had a major influence on the young [[Jacques Derrida]], a fellow French Jew whose seminal ''Writing and Difference'' contains an essay, "Violence and Metaphysics", on Levinas. Derrida also delivered a eulogy at Levinas's funeral, later published as ''Adieu à Emmanuel Levinas'', an appreciation and exploration of Levinas's moral philosophy. In a memorial essay for Levinas, [[Jean-Luc Marion]] claimed that "If one defines a great philosopher as someone without whom philosophy would not have been what it is, then in France there are two great philosophers of the 20th Century: [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] and Lévinas."<ref>http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/print.asp?editorial_id=9839</ref>\u000a\u000aA concise evaluation of his influence on modern philosophical thought may be found in his ''New York Times'' obituary.<ref name="Levinas's obituary"/>\u000a\u000a==Cultural influence==\u000aFor three decades, Levinas gave short talks on [[Rashi]] every Shabbat morning at the Jewish high school in Paris where he was the principal. This tradition strongly influenced many generations of students.<ref>[http://www.hartman.org.il/Research_And_Comment_View.asp?Article_Id=456&Cat_Id=323&Cat_Type=research_and_comment Weekly Shabbat talks by Emmanuel Levinas]</ref> \u000a \u000a[[Dardenne brothers|Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne]],<ref name="Dardenne Study">{{cite book | title=Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne - Contemporary Film Directors | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Joseph Mai | year=2010 | pages=ix-xvii | isbn=978-0-252-07711-1}}</ref> renowned Belgian filmmakers, have referred to Levinas as an important underpinning for their filmmaking ethics.\u000a\u000aIn his book ''Levinas and the Cinema of Redemption: Time, Ethics, and the Feminine'', author [[Sam Girgus]] argues that Levinas has dramatically affected films involving redemption. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Girgus|first1=Sam|title=Conversations with Scholars of American Popular Culture|url=http://www.americanpopularculture.com/journal/articles/spring_2010/girgus.htm|website=Americana|publisher=Americana: The Journal of American Popular Culture|accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref> \u000a\u000a==Published works==\u000aA full bibliography of all Levinas's publications up until 1981 is found in Roger Burggraeve ''Emmanuel Levinas'' (1982).\u000a\u000aA list of works, translated into English but not appearing in any collections, may be found in [[Simon Critchley|Critchley, S.]] and [[Robert Bernasconi|Bernasconi, R.]] (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Levinas'' (publ.
