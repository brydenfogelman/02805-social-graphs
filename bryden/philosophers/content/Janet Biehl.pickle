Bookchin considered her ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' to be the best introduction to his work.\u000a\u000aBiehl is a supporter of the Kurdish rights movement in Turkey. [[Abdullah Öcalan]], leader of the insurgent [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], had become an avid reader of Bookchin's work after he was captured and imprisoned in 1999 and tried to arrange a meeting with Bookchin before he died, but was unsuccessful. Following the 2006 death of Bookchin, Biehl became involved in pro-Kurdish activism.
