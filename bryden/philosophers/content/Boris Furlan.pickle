Together with the [[liberal conservative]] Slovenian émigré politicians [[Izidor Cankar]] and [[Franc Snoj]], Furlan propagated for the Yugoslav and Slovene cause. In 1942, he published a brochure titled ''Fighting Yugoslavia: The Struggle of the Slovenes'', in which he articulated, among other, the Slovenian claims for the annexation of his native [[Julian March]] region to Yugoslavia. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\u000a\u000aIn 1943, he moved to London, where he served as Minister of Education in the [[exile government]] of [[Milo\u0161 Trifunovi\u0107]] between June and August 1943.
