Jeffrey''' (August 5, 1926 \u2013 November 9, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], [[logician]], and [[probability theory|probability theorist]]. He was a native of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\u000a\u000aJeffrey served in the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. As a graduate student he studied under [[Rudolf Carnap]], and [[Carl Hempel]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Jeffrey|first=Richard|title=A Proposal to the National Science Foundation for Support of Research on Carnap's Indictive Logic| url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735062223890.pdf|work=Richard Jeffery's Papers|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=September 17, 2013 }}</ref> He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1952 and his [[Ph.D.]] from Princeton in 1957. After holding academic positions at  [[MIT]], [[City College of New York]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he joined the faculty of [[Princeton University]] in 1974 and became a professor [[emeritus]] there in 1999. He was also a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]].\u000a\u000aAs a philosopher, Jeffrey specialized in [[epistemology]] and [[decision theory]]. He is perhaps best known for defending and developing the [[Bayesianism|Bayesian]] approach to probability\u2014specifically, for inventing "[[Jeffrey conditioning]]" (which he referred to as "probability kinematics"), a way of modeling the change in the [[probability]] of a [[proposition]] in light of new [[evidence]].\u000a\u000aJeffrey also wrote or co-wrote two widely used and influential [[logic]] textbooks: ''Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits'', a basic introduction to logic, and ''Computability and Logic'', a more advanced text dealing with, among other things, the famous negative results of twentieth century logic such as [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]].\u000a\u000aJeffrey, who died of [[lung cancer]] at the age of 76, was known for his sense of humor, which often came through in his breezy writing style. In the preface of his posthumously published ''Subjective Probability'', he refers to himself as "a fond foolish old fart dying of a surfeit of [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Malls]]" (p. xii).\u000a\u000a== Selected bibliography ==\u000a* ''Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits''. 3rd ed.
