He is seen as the theorist behind the "[[Modern Breakthrough]]" of Scandinavian culture. At the age of 30, Brandes formulated the principles of a new [[Literary realism|realism]] and [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], condemning hyper-aesthetic writing and also fantasy in literature. His literary goals were shared by some other authors, among them the Norwegian "[[Realism (theatre)|realist]]" playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].\u000a\u000aWhen Georg Brandes held a series of lectures in 1871 with the title "Main Currents in 19th-century Literature", he defined the [[Modern Breakthrough]] and started the movement that would become [[Cultural Radicalism]]. In 1884 [[Viggo Hørup]], Georg Brandes, and his brother [[Edvard Brandes]] started the daily newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' with the motto: "The paper of greater enlightenment". The paper and their political debates led to a split of the liberal party [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] in 1905 and created the new party [[Det Radikale Venstre]].\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000a\u000a===Youth===\u000aGeorg Brandes was born as "Morris Cohen" in [[Copenhagen]] into a non-observant Jewish middle-class family, the elder brother of prominent Danes [[Ernst Immanuel Cohen Brandes|Ernst Brandes]] and Edvard Brandes. He became a student at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1859 where he first studied [[jurisprudence]]. From this, however, his interests soon turned to [[philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]]. In 1862 he won the gold medal of the university for an essay on ''The Idea of Nemesis among the Ancients''. Before this, indeed since 1858, he had shown a remarkable gift for verse-writing, the results of which, however, were not abundant enough to justify separate publication. Brandes did not collect his poems until as late as 1898. At the university, which he left in 1864, Brandes was influenced by the writings of [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Heiberg]] in criticism and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in philosophy, influences which continued to leave traces on his work.<ref name="britannica">{{EB1911|wstitle=Brandes, Georg Morris Cohen}}</ref>\u000a\u000a[[File:Georg Brandes som ung.jpg|thumb|right|Georg Brandes in his youth. 1868 drawing by [[Godtfred Rump]].]]\u000aIn 1866, he contributed to the discussion of the works of Rasmus Nielsen in "Dualism in our Recent Philosophy". From 1865 to 1871 he traveled much in Europe, acquainting himself with the condition of literature in the principal centers of learning. His first important contribution to letters was his ''Aesthetic Studies'' (1868), where his maturer method is already foreshadowed in several brief monographs on Danish poets. In 1870 he published several important volumes, ''The French Aesthetics of the Present Day'', dealing chiefly with [[Hippolyte Taine]], ''Criticisms and Portraits'', and a translation of ''The Subjection of Women'' by [[John Stuart Mill]], whom he had met that year during a visit to England.<ref name="britannica"/>\u000a\u000a===The Modern Breakthrough===\u000a{{Main|Modern Breakthrough}}\u000aBrandes now took his place as the leading northern European critic, applying to local conditions and habits of thought the methods of Taine. He became ''Docent'' or reader in Aesthetics at the University of Copenhagen,<ref name="britannica"/> where his lectures were a great success and gathered huge audiences.<ref name="thellufsen">Ole Friis Thellufsen, [http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/georg-brandes/ Artikel: Georg Brandes], [[Aarhus University]], 29 July 2009</ref> His famous opening lecture on 3 November 1871, ''Hovedstrømninger i det 19de Aarhundredes Litteratur'' ({{lang-en|Main Currents in the Literature of the Nineteenth Century}}), signalled the beginning of his lifelong struggle to modernize Danish literature.<ref name="gyldendal">[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Litteratur/Dansk_litteratur/Kritikere/Georg_Morris_Cohen_Brandes?highlight=georg%20brandes Georg Brandes] at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi</ref> After the professorship of aesthetics became vacant in 1872, it was taken as a matter of course that Brandes would fill it. But the young critic had offended many sensibilities by his ardent advocacy of modern ideas; he was seen as a Jew (which he did not consider himself to be), his convictions were Radical, he was suspected of being an [[atheist]]. The authorities refused to appoint him, but his fitness for the post was so obvious that the chair of Aesthetics remained vacant for years, since no one else daring to place himself in comparison with Brandes.<ref name="britannica"/>\u000a\u000a[[File:Hovedstrøminger 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Danish first edition of Brandes' ''Hovedstrømninger i det 19de Aarhundredes Litteratur \u2013 Emigrantlitteraturen'' from 1872.]]\u000aIn the middle of these polemics, Brandes began to issue volumes of the most ambitious of his works, ''Main Currents in the Literature of the Nineteenth Century'', of which four volumes appeared between 1872 and 1875 (English translation, 1901\u20131905). The brilliant novelty of this criticism of the literature of major European countries at the beginning of the 19th century, and his description of the general revolt against the pseudo-classicism of the 18th century, at once attracted attention outside Denmark. The tumult which gathered round the person of the critic increased the success of the work, and the reputation of Brandes grew apace, especially in Germany and [[Russia]].<ref name="britannica"/>\u000a\u000aIn 1877 Brandes left Copenhagen and settled in Berlin, taking a considerable part in the aesthetic life of that city. His political views, however, made [[Prussia]] uncomfortable with him, and he returned in 1883 to Copenhagen, where he found a whole new school of writers and thinkers eager to receive him as their leader.<ref name="britannica"/> He headed the group "Det moderne Gjennembruds Mænd" (''The Men of the Modern Breakthrough''), composed of [[J.P. Jacobsen]], [[Holger Drachmann]], Edvard Brandes, Erik Skram, [[Sophus Schandorph]], and Norwegians [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]],<ref name="gyldendal"/> but a conservative reaction against his "realistic" doctrines began around 1883, headed by Holger Drachmann.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Litteratur/Dansk_litteratur/1870-1900/Holger_Henrik_Herholdt_Drachmann Holger Henrik Herholdt Drachmann] at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi</ref>\u000a\u000a===Later authorship===\u000aAmong his later writings must be mentioned the monographs on [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1877), on [[Esaias Tegnér]] (1878), on [[Benjamin Disraeli]] (1878), [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] (in German, 1877), [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1884), on [[Henrik Ibsen]] (1899) and on [[Anatole France]] (1905). Brandes wrote with great depth on the main contemporary poets and novelists of Denmark and Norway, and he and his disciples were for a long time the arbiters of literary success in the north. His ''Danish Poets'' (1877), containing studies of [[Carsten Hauch]], [[Ludvig Bødtcher]], [[Christian Winther]] and [[Frederick Paludan-Müller]], his ''Men of the Modern Transition'' (1883), and his ''Essays'' (1889), are volumes essential to the proper study of modern [[Scandinavian literature]]. He wrote an excellent book on [[Poland]] (1888; English translation, 1903), and was one of the editors of the German version of Ibsen.<ref name="britannica"/>\u000a\u000aThe most important of his later works was his study of [[William Shakespeare]] (1897\u20131898), which was translated into English by [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and was highly acclaimed. It was, perhaps, history's most authoritative work on Shakespeare not principally intended for an English-speaking audience.<ref name="britannica"/> He was afterwards engaged in writing a history of modern Scandinavian literature. In his critical work, which extended over a wider field than that of any other living writer, Brandes was aided by a singularly charming style, lucid and reasonable, enthusiastic but without extravagance, brilliant and colored without affectation. In 1900 he collected his works for the first time in a complete and popular edition and began to work on a German edition, completed in 1902.<ref name="britannica"/>\u000a\u000aHe published ''Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature'' in 1906 (six volumes). This book was among the 100 best books for education selected in 2008 by [[Will Durant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/52411-will-durant-s-100-best-books-for-an-education?page=2 |title=Will Durant's 100 Best Books for an Education on Lists of Bests |publisher=Listsofbests.com |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Durant and Brandes were both contributors to the [[Mother Earth (magazine)|''Mother Earth'']] magazine. In Volume 2 Brandes says about Kierkegaard, "It is not merely in name that this irony bears a fundamental resemblance to Kierkegaard's, which also aristocratically "chooses to be misunderstood". The Ego of genius is the truth, if not in the sense in which Kierkegaard would have us understand his proposition, "[[Subjectivity]] is the truth", still in the sense that the Ego has every externally valid commandment and prohibition in its power; and, to the astonishment and scandal of the world, invariably expresses itself in paradoxes. [[Irony]] is "divine audacity". In audacity thus comprehended there are endless possibilities. It is freedom from prejudice, yet it suggests the possibility of the most audacious defense of all possible kinds of prejudices. It is more easily attainable, we are told, by woman than by man. \u201cLike the feminine garb, the feminine intellect has this advantage over the masculine, that its possessor by a single daring movement can rise above all the prejudices of civilization and bourgeois conventionality, at once transporting herself into the state of innocence and the lap of Nature". The lap of Nature! There is an echo of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s voice even in this wanton tirade. We seem to hear the trumpet-call of revolution; what we really hear is only the proclamation of reaction. Rousseau desired to return to the state of nature, when men roamed naked through the pathless forests and lived upon acorns. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] wished to turn the course of evolution back to the primeval ages, to the days before man had fallen. [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]] blows revolutionary melodies on the great romantic "wonder-horn".<ref>See p. 72 Main Currents in Nineteenth, Century Literature Vol. 2 Georg Brandes, 1906.</ref>\u000a\u000a===Personal life and last years===\u000a[[File:George Brandes cph.3b29701.jpg|thumb|upright|Brandes in 1904]]\u000aIn the late 1880s, Brandes fought against what he saw as the hypocrisy of prudish sexuality, which caused a rift with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.<ref name="knudsen"/> Between the years of 1886 and 1888 Brandes was engaged in a relationship with the Swedish author [[Victoria Benedictsson]], who wrote ''Penningar'' and ''Fru Marianne'' under the male pseudonym Ernst Ahlgren. Benedictsson committed suicide in a [[Copenhagen]] hotel room,<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Litteratur/Svensk_litteratur/1880-1900/Victoria_Benedictsson Victoria Benedictsson] at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi</ref> and the relationship with Brandes has later been blamed as the cause for her death.<ref name="knudsen">[http://adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/FpPdf.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&ff_id=2 Georg Brandes \u2013 Forfatterportræt ved Jørgen Knudsen] at Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the late 1880s, Brandes turned to concentrating on "great personalities" as the source of culture. In this period, he discovered [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], not only introducing him to Scandinavian culture but indirectly to the whole world.<ref>''Georg Brandes: A Biographical Note'' \u2013 Edouard d'Araille / Introduction to 'Friedrich Nietzsche' (2002, LTMI)</ref> The series of lectures that he gave on Nietzsche's thought, which he described as "aristocratic radicalism", were the first to present Nietzsche as a world cultural figure in need of full intellectual notice. Of Brandes' description of his philosophy, Nietzsche himself remarked: "The expression 'aristocratic radicalism', which you employ, is very good. It is, permit me to say, the cleverest thing that I have yet read about myself".<ref>Nietzsche, Letter to Georg Brandes \u2013 December 2nd 1887.</ref> In 1909 the lectures were edited and published as the monograph ''Friedrich Nietzsche'', which included the complete Nietzche/Brandes correspondence as well as two essays in homage to the late Nietzsche's life and thought. Translated into English by A.G. Chater, the volume was published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1911 and Nietzsche's thought was thus able to reach a significant English language audience before [[World War I]]. It was Brandes who, in an 1888 letter,<ref>Georg Brandes, Letter to Nietzsche \u2013 January 11th 1888.</ref> wrote to Nietzsche advising him to read the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], with whom his thought had much in common. There is no evidence, however, that Nietzsche ever did read any volume by Kierkegaard.\u000a\u000aThe key idea of "aristocratic radicalism" went on to influence most of the later works of Brandes and resulted in voluminous biographies ''Wolfgang [[Goethe]]'' (1914\u201315), ''Francois de [[Voltaire]]'' (1916\u201317), ''[[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Cæsar]]'' 1918 and [[Michelangelo]] (1921).<ref name="gyldendal"/>\u000a\u000aIn the 1900s, Brandes fought the Danish political establishment on several occasions, but eventually had to curb his acidic attacks. However, his international reputation was growing.<ref name="knudsen"/> In many ways he emulated his own assessment of [[Voltaire]], as an author against habitual thinking, hypocrisy and the thin veneer of morality.<ref name="gyldendal"/> He condemned the maltreatment of national [[minority group|minorities]], the persecution of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], etc. During World War I, he condemned the national aggression and [[imperialism]] on both sides and his last years were dedicated to anti-religious polemic. In this late period he made new connections to intellectuals like [[Henri Barbusse]] and [[Romain Rolland]] when he was co-signer in the foundation of [[Clarté]], as well as [[E. D. Morel]].<ref name="knudsen"/>\u000a\u000aGeorg Brandes was an atheist.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Nh_Ogtnpqc0C&pg=PA17&dq=Georg+Brandes+atheist&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1s5rEmPLOAhVF1x4KHYdRDE4Q6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&q=Georg%20Brandes%20atheist&f=false</ref><ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=tDBIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=Fridtjof+Nansen+atheist&source=bl&ots=c9mY6MoMiv&sig=UX4VFV352OZCV8IY3Gdml-kHT6I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkgIaVl_LOAhXG2R4KHbydCa44ChDoAQgmMAM#v=onepage&q=Fridtjof%20Nansen%20atheist&f=false</ref>\u000a\u000a==Legacy==\u000aBrandes stands as one of the most influential inspirations of Danish culture, an equal of Holberg, [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] and [[Ansgar]]. Among his supporters, Brandes' work was seen as a liberator from repressive norms, authority and hypocrisy, and he served as an inspiration for many contemporary writers. On the other hand, conservative circles condemned him as an immoral, unpatriotic and subversive blasphemer; as he became the lynchpin of criticism against [[modernity]] in its entirety.<ref name="knudsen"/> At the same time, some socialists criticized his elitist attitudes, while some [[feminist]]s have regarded his attitude of sexual equality as being inconsequential.<ref name="knudsen"/>\u000a\u000aHis brother Edvard (1847\u20131931), also a well-known critic, was the author of a number of plays, and of two psychological novels: ''A Politician'' (1889), and ''Young Blood'' (1899). He became an outstanding political figure of the party [[Det Radikale Venstre]].<ref name="gyldendal"/>\u000a\u000a==Quotations==\u000a* It would be as impossible for me to attack Christianity as it would be impossible for me to attack werewolves.<ref>From ''Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1921): Brandes to Nietzsche, 23 November 1888.</ref>\u000a* I was very much surprised when [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] informed me that he had not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire [[Hegelian]] philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, [[Hans Brochner]], who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I came to the conclusion that here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.\u000a** ''Reminiscences of my Childhood and Youth'' (1906), pp.&nbsp;276\u2013277\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[Helen Zelezny-Scholz]]\u000a* [[Sedlighetsdebatten]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist|2}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a* Allen, Julie K.
