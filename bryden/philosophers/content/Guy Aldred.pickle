V{{Anarchism sidebar}}\u000a'''Guy Alfred Aldred''' (often '''Guy A. Aldred'''; 5 November 1886 \u2013 16 October 1963) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Anarcho-communism|anarchist communist]] and a prominent member of the [[Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation]] (APCF).  He founded the [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]] Press publishing house and edited five [[Glasgow]]-based anarchist periodicals: ''The Herald of Revolt'', ''The Spur'', ''The Commune'', ''The Council'', and ''The Word'', where he worked closely with [[Ethel MacDonald]] and his later partner [[Jenny Patrick]].\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aAldred was born in [[Clerkenwell]], [[London]]. His father was a 22-year-old lieutenant in the [[Royal Navy]], and his mother was Ada Caroline Holdsworth, a 19-year-old [[parasol]] maker. Although Ada was socially unacceptable to the young naval officer, he married her shortly before Guy's birth. After the wedding, he left her at the church to return to his mother. [[Guy Fawkes]] night, 5 November, gave Guy his forename. Guy was brought up in the home of Ada\u2019s father, Charles Holdsworth, a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]]. He attended the Iron Infant's School in [[Farringdon Road]], later moving to the Hugh Middleton Higher Grade School, where he was presented to the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] because he was the youngest pupil. One of his fellow pupils was the son of [[Hermann Jung]], the Swiss watchmaker and one-time activist in the [[First International]]. His first adventures in [[propaganda]] were with the [[Anti-Nicotine League]], the [[Band of Hope]], and the [[total abstinence]] movement, and he remained an abstainer in these respects all his life.\u000a\u000aHis grandfather, an [[Anglican]], encouraged him to attend the church of [[St Anne and St Agnes]], where he took communion in 1894. However, he soon developed a critical attitude to the church, even though he was close to his cousin, a curate at [[Holloway, London|Holloway]].\u000a\u000aAt the age of 15 (1902), he was made aware of his London [[provincialism]] when Sir Madlio Singh, the [[Maharaja]] of [[Jeypore]], visited the city. He became fascinated by the newspaper accounts of the Maharaja moving around with his "travelling god":\u000a{{cquote|The Rajah's god was a substantial fact. It had invaded my petty little world. It had brought home to me the realities of other cities and of other religions. It had made known to me,as no mere study could have done, the fact that Christianity was ''not'' the religion of the world. It had brought home to my understanding the fact that there was an Oriental theology beyond the pale of Christian orthodoxy.<ref>''Dogmas Discarded: An Autobiography of Thought 1886 - 1908'', by Guy Aldred, Part 1, page 16, Strickland Press, Glasgow 1904</ref>}}\u000a\u000aLater that year he gained a reputation as a "Boy Preacher", printing and handing out his own leaflets, which were often received with ridicule and disdain. He found employment as an office boy with the [[National Press Agency]] in Whitefriars House, where he was promoted to sub-editor. Working with an evangelist named McMasters, he co-founded the "Christian Social Mission", opening shortly after his 16th birthday as the ''[[Holloway, London|Holloway]] Boy Preacher''. His [[non-conformist]] approach aroused concern following his first sermon.\u000a\u000aAfter contacting [[Charles Voysey (theist)|Charles Voysey]], Guy was eventually granted an audience on 20 December 1902. The 74-year-old well-to-do Voysey was surprised to be confronted with a coarse-dressed 16-year-old working class boy. After careful preliminaries on the part of Voysey, the meeting lasted three hours. Their friendship was to continue until Voysey\u2019s death in 1912.\u000a\u000aIn January 1903 the Reverend George Martin, an Anglican priest, visited Guy with one of his leaflets, asking to meet the ''Holloway Boy Preacher''. Martin worked in London\u2019s worst slums, and Guy joined him in his work with London\u2019s poorest. His friendship with Martin lasted six years and influenced Guy strongly. He soon gave his last sermon from the pulpit and left the "Christian Social Mission".\u000a\u000a==Agnosticism==\u000aGuy became a speaker at the ''Institute of [[Theism]]'', but soon felt it was time to set up his own organisation. In 1904 he founded the ''Theistic Mission'', which met every Sunday. With a considerable, though sometimes boisterous, crowd, Guy was gaining a reputation as a forceful young orator. He was also shifting towards [[atheism]]. By August, the meeting banner was changed to read ''The Clerkenwell [[Freethought]] Mission''. Meetings often generated extreme hostility. On one occasion the crowd charged the platform, knocking Guy to the ground and beating him. Police intervention put an end to the meeting. Around this time he became interested in ''The [[Agnostic]] Journal'' and became friendly with its editor, [[William Stewart Ross|"Saladin"]], a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]]. It was at the Journal\u2019s office that he met another Scotsman, John Morrison Davidson, and Guy became more interested in Scottish affairs.\u000a\u000a==Indian Sedition Trial, 1907==\u000a[[File:The Indian Sociologist (masthead) (Vol. 5, no. 8 - August 1909).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Mast head of ''The Indian Sociologist'']]\u000a''[[The Indian Sociologist]]'' was an [[India]]n nationalist newspaper edited by [[Shyamji Krishnavarma]]. When Krishnavarma left London for Paris, fearing repression by the authorities, the printing of the newspaper was first taken over by Arthur Fletcher Horsley. However, he was arrested and tried for printing the May, June and July issues. (He was tried and sentenced on the same day as [[Madan Lal Dhingra]], who was convicted of the assassination of [[Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie]]). At Horseley's prominent trial the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Lord Alverstone]], indicated that anyone printing that sort of material would be liable for prosecution. Nevertheless, Aldred, as an advocate of the [[Freedom of the press|free press]], published it, bearing his own name. The police obtained a warrant and seized 396 copies of the issue. At the trial the prosecution was led by  the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], Sir [[William Robson, Baron Robson|William Robson]], at the [[Old Bailey|Central Criminal Court]]. Robson highlighted parts of ''TIS'' which Aldred had himself written, particularly focussing on a passage which touched on the execution of Dhingra:\u000a{{cquote|In the execution of Dhingra that cloak will be publicly worn, that secret language spoken, that solemn veil employed to conceal the sword of Imperialism by which we are sacrificed to the insatiable idol of modern despotism, whose ministers are [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Cromer]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] and [[John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|Morley]] & Co. Murder - which they would represent to us as a horrible crime, when the murdered is a government flunkey - we see practised by them without repugnance or remorse when the murdered is a working man, a Nationalist patriot, an [[Egypt]]ian fellaheen or half-starved victim of despotic society's bloodlust. It was so at [[Featherstone]] and [[Denshawai]]; it has often been so at [[Newgate]]: and it was so with [[Robert Emmett]], the [[Paris Commune|Paris communards]], and the [[Haymarket Riot|Chicago martyrs]]. Who is more reprehensible than the murderers of these martyrs? The police spies who threw the bomb at [[Chicago]]; the ad-hoc tribunal which murdered innocent Egyptians at Denshawai; the [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] who assumed full responsibility for the murder of the workers at Feathersone; the assassins of Robert Emmett? Yet these murderers have not been executed! Why then should Dhingra be executed? Because he is not a time-serving executioner, but a Nationalist patriot, who, though his ideals are not their ideals, is worthy of the admiration of those workers at home, who have as little to gain from the lick-spittle crew of Imperialistic blood-sucking, capitalist parasites at as what the Nationalists have in India.}}\u000a\u000aAldred also remarked that the Sepoy Mutiny, or Indian Mutiny, would be described as [[War of Independence of 1857|The Indian War of Independence]]. Aldred received a sentence of twelve months hard labour.<ref>''Rex v. Aldred'' by Guy Aldred, Strickland Press, [[Glasgow]], 1948</ref> His involvement with ''The Indian Sociologist'' brought him into contact with [[Har Dayal]], who combined anarchism with his [[Indian Nationalism]], based on his view of ancient [[Aryan]] culture and [[Buddhism]].\u000a\u000a==Socialism and anarchism==\u000aAldred joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]], but left in 1906.  He was a political [[conscientious objector]] during the [[First World War]] and also a founder of the Glasgow [[Anarchist]] Group. He initiated the Communist Propaganda Groups, in support of the [[October Revolution]], which subsequently became a component of the [[Communist League (UK, 1919)|Communist League]] in 1919.  Following its collapse, he founded the [[Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation]] (APCF) in 1921, and gradually moved towards opposing the [[Soviet Union]].  His links with [[left communist]]s across Europe brought him close to [[council communism]].\u000a\u000aIn 1932 he split with the APCF and later founded the [[Workers Open Forum]], which eventually became the [[United Socialist Movement]]. During [[World War II]] the USM worked with people from across the political spectrum to oppose military action, in a form of [[Popular Front]], and came to advocate [[World Government]].  After [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, Aldred became increasingly supportive of the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000a==Free love==\u000aAldred worked closely with his partner [[Rose Witcop]] (9 April 1890 - 4 July 1932), a pioneer of [[birth control]] and sister of [[Milly Witkop]] (who was, in turn, partner of anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]]).<ref name="DNB_Witcop">Nicolas Walter, \u2018Witcop, Rose Lillian (1890\u20131932)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58610 http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58610], accessed 4 Sept 2007</ref>\u000a\u000aTogether they published an edition of [[Margaret Sanger]]'s ''Family Limitation'', an action which saw them denounced by a London magistrate for "indiscriminate" publication<ref name="Times19230111">''The Times'', January 11, 1923, p.7</ref> and, despite expert testimony from a consultant to [[Guy's Hospital]] and evidence at the appeal that the book had only been sold to those aged over twenty-one, the stock was ordered to be destroyed.<ref name="Times19230210">''The Times'', 12 February 1923, p.5</ref> Their case had been strongly supported by [[Dora Russell]] who, with her husband [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]], paid the legal costs of the appeal.<ref name="Russell">Russell, Dora, (1975) ''The Tamarisk Tree''</ref>\u000a\u000aAldred and Witcop had a son, Annesley, in 1909. Although they were drifting apart by the time Aldred settled permanently in Glasgow in 1922, finally parting in 1924, they had a legal marriage on 2 February 1926, when it seemed possible Witcop might be deported for her continuing work on [[family planning]].<ref name="Caldwell_1988_p211">Caldwell, John Taylor (1988), Come Dungeons Dark: The Life and Times of Guy Aldred, Glasgow Anarchist, p.211.
