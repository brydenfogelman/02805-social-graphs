V'''Mazdak''' ([[Middle Persian]]: [[Image:mazdak.png|25px]]) (died c. 524 or 528) (also '''Mazdak the Younger''') was a Zoroastrian prophet, [[Iran]]ian reformer and religious activist who gained influence under the reign of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] emperor [[Kavadh I]]. He claimed to be a prophet of [[Ahura Mazda]], and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs. He has been seen as a [[socialism|proto-socialist]].<ref name="Manfred">{{Cite book|editor=Manfred, Albert Zakharovich|year=1974|title=A Short History of the World|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|volume=1|page=182|others=(translated into English by Katherine Judelson)|oclc=1159025}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Mazdakism==\u000aMazdak was the chief representative of a religious and philosophical teaching called Mazdakism,  which he viewed as a reformed and purified version of [[Zoroastrianism]],<ref name="ya56">{{Cite book|author=Yarshater, Ehsan|year=1983|title=Cambridge history of Iran The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods|volume=2|pages=995&ndash;997|isbn=978-0-521-24693-4}}</ref><ref name=cosmo>[http://azargoshnasp.net/famous/babak_khorramdin/teachingsmazdakshaki.pdf Shaki, Mansour. 1985.

Mazdak's followers are considered to be the first real socialists in human history by their emphasis on community property and community work with benefits accruing to all.<ref name="Manfred" /><ref name="Quran">{{Cite book|author=Wherry, Rev.

These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, tainting everything except God. Light is characterized by knowledge and feeling, and acts by design and free will, whereas Darkness is ignorant and blind, and acts at random. Mankind's role in this life was, through good conduct, to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. But where Manichaeism saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Mazdakism is reported, in one late work, to have distinguished three elements (Fire, Water, Earth), and four Powers (Discernment, Understanding, Preservation and Joy, corresponding to the four chief officials of the Sassanid state &ndash; the Chief Mobad (''Mobadan Mobad''), the Chief [[Herbad]], the Commander of the Army and the Entertainment Master), seven Viziers and twelve Spiritual Forces. When the Four, the Seven and the Twelve were united in a human being, he was no longer subject to religious duties. In addition, God was believed to rule the world through letters, which held the key to the Great Secret that should be learned. This description suggests that Mazdakism was, in many ways, a typical [[Gnosticism|Gnostic sect]].<ref>{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=1007&ndash;1008}}</ref>\u000a\u000a===Ethical and social principles===\u000aTwo distinguishing factors of Mazdak's teaching were the reduction of the importance of religious formalities\u2014the true religious person being the one who understood and related correctly to the principles of the universe\u2014and a criticism of the strong position of mainstream clergy, who, he believed, had oppressed the Persian population and caused much poverty.\u000a\u000aMazdak emphasised good conduct, which involved a moral and ascetic life, no killing and [[vegetarianism]] (which contained substances solely from Darkness), being kind and friendly and living in peace with other people.\u000a\u000aIn many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social [[revolution]], and has been referred to as early "[[communism]]".<ref name="Quran" /> He and his followers were also advocates of [[free love]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rehatsek|first1=Edward|authorlink1=Edward Rehatsek|title=Christianity in the Persian Dominions, from its beginning till the fall of the Sasanian dynasty|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay|date=1 January 1878|volume=13|page=75|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B7aRSFhKUrgC&pg=PA75|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bombay.|language=en}}</ref>\u000a\u000aAccording to Mazdak, God had originally placed the means of subsistence on earth so that people should divide them among themselves equally, but the strong had coerced the weak, seeking domination and causing the contemporary inequality. This in turn empowered the "Five Demons" that turned men from Righteousness \u2013 these were Envy, Wrath, Vengeance, Need and Greed. To prevail over these evils, justice had to be restored and everybody should share excess possessions with his fellow men. Mazdak allegedly planned to achieve this by making all wealth common or by re-distributing the excess,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Crone, Patricia|year=1991|title=Kavad\u2019s Heresy and Mazdak\u2019s Revolt|journal=Iran (Journal of Persian Studies)|publisher=British Institute of Persian Studies|volume=29|pages=21\u201340|url=http://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Mazdak.pdf}}</ref> although it is unclear how he intended to organize that in terms of regulations and to what extent his position has been caricatured by hostile sources.<ref name=ya1000>{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=999&ndash;1000}}</ref> The hostile sources mostly dwell on the alleged "sharing" of women, the resulting sexual [[promiscuity]] and the confusion of the [[line of descent]]. Since the latter is a standard accusation against heretical sects, its veracity has been doubted by researchers; it is likely that Mazdak took measures against the widespread [[polygamy]] of the rich and lack of wives for the poor.<ref name=ya1000 />\u000a\u000a==Followers==\u000aMazdak's teaching acquired many followers, to the point when even King [[Kavadh I]], ruling from 488 until 531, converted to Mazdakism. He also reportedly sponsored its adoption by the Arab vassal kingdom of [[al-Hirah]], entailing the deposing of the previous king al-Mundhir by the [[Kindah|Kindite]] chief al-Harith.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Yarshater, Ehsan|chapter=The Persian presence in the Islamic world|editor=Hovannisian, Richard G. |editor2=Sabagh, Georges|year=1998|title=The Persian Presence in the Islamic World|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=4&ndash;125, [https://books.google.com/books?id=39XZDnOWUXsC&pg=PA28 page 28]|isbn=978-0-521-59185-0}}</ref><ref>Khanam, R. 2005.

Mazdak had government warehouses opened to help the poor. He also had all the Zoroastrian fire temples closed except the three major ones.\u000a\u000a==Opposition to and purge of Mazdak's adherents==\u000aFear among the [[nobility]] and Zoroastrian clergy grew so strong that King Kavadh was overthrown in 496, but he managed to regain the throne three years later with the help of the [[Hephthalite Empire]].\u000a\u000aA Jewish tradition relates a slightly different story. The [[Exilarch]] of Babylon, [[Mar-Zutra II]], rallied the Jewish community and their allies, who defeated Mazdak and established an independent Jewish kingdom in [[Mahoza]] that lasted for seven years<ref>\u000a{{Citation\u000a|chapter= Babylonia\u000a|title= Encyclopaedia Judaica\u000a|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_01807.html\u000a}}\u000a</ref> \u000a(495-502).\u000a\u000aScared by the resistance among the powerful, he chose to distance himself from Mazdak. He allowed [[Anushiravan]] to launch a campaign against the Mazdakites in 524 or 528, culminating in a massacre of most of the adherents - including Mazdak himself - and restoring orthodox Zoroastrianism as the state religion.<ref name="Quran" /> Various fictionalized accounts<ref name=yarfict>{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|page=994}}</ref> specify the manner of execution: for example, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' states that 3000 Mazdakites were buried alive with the feet upwards in order to present Mazdak with the spectacle of a "human garden", whereas Mazdak himself was hanged upside down and shot with countless arrows; other stories specify other torturous methods of execution. Anushiravan then proceeded to implement his own far-reaching social and administrative reforms.<ref>{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|page=1022}}</ref> The Mazdakite ruler of al-Hirah was also overthrown{{by whom?|date=July 2016}} and the previous king restored to power.\u000a\u000a==Legacy==\u000aA few Mazdakis survived, and settled in remote areas. Small pockets of Mazdakite societies are said to have survived for centuries after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. Their doctrines probably mixed with radical currents of [[Shia Islam]], influencing them and giving rise to later powerful revolutionary-religious movements in the region. The cult of [[al-Muqanna|al-Muqanna\u2018]], who claimed to be the incarnation of God and had followers among the Mubaiyyidah sect of Shia and even some Turks, upheld the laws and institutes of Mazdak.<ref>[http://journals.iium.edu.my/intdiscourse/index.php/islam/article/viewFile/252/234 Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b: Father of Comparative Religion]</ref> In the 9th century, the [[Khurramites]], an egalitarian religious sect possibly originating from Mazdakism, led a revolt under the leadership of [[Babak Khorramdin]] against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and successfully defended large territories against the Caliphate's forces for some twenty years.<ref>{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=1003&ndash;1004}}</ref> The [[Batiniyya]], [[Qarmatians]] and other later revolutionary currents of Islam may also be connected to Mazdakism and were often equated with it by contemporary authors.<ref>{{harvnb|Yarshater|1983|pages=1022&ndash;1023}}</ref> Turkish scholar Abdülbâkî Gölp\u0131narl\u0131 sees even the [[Qizilbash]] of the 16th century - a radical Shi'i movement in Persia which helped the [[Safaviyya]] establish [[Twelver]] Islam as the dominant religion of Iran \u2013 as "spiritual descendants of the [[Khurramites]]" and, hence, of the Mazdakites.<ref name="S-G">Roger M.
