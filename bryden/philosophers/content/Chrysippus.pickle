He created an original system of [[propositional logic]] in order to better understand the workings of the universe and role of humanity within it. He adhered to a [[deterministic]] view of [[Destiny|fate]], but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in thought and action. Ethics, he taught, depended on understanding the nature of the universe, and he taught a therapy of [[wikt:extirpate|extirpating]] the [[Stoic passions|unruly passions]] which depress and crush the soul.

Writing five-hundred years later, [[Sextus Empiricus]] refers to a debate between Diodorus and Philo.<ref name="sextus1">[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Pyr. Hyp.'' ii. 110\u2013112; ''Adv. Math.'' viii. 112\u2013117</ref> Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] had an incorrect [[consequent]], and this meant a proposition such as "if it is day, then I am talking," is true unless it is day and I fall silent.<ref name="sextus2">Sextus Empiricus, ''Pyr. Hyp.'', ii. 110\u2013112</ref> But Diodorus argued that a true conditional is one in which the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion \u2013 thus, because the proposition "if it is day, then I am talking" can be false, it is invalid.<ref name="sextus1"/> However, [[Paradoxes of material implication|paradoxical propositions]] were still possible such as "if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists."<ref name="sextus2"/> Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible:<ref>When Sextus Empiricus reports the different criteria offered by ancient philosophers for the truth of conditional propositions, he does not mention Chrysippus by name, but modern scholars believe that Chrysippus authored, or, at least, held this view.

For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, he says, it was fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this personal effort. ...

Chrysippus accepted [[divination]] as part of the [[causal chain]] of [[Destiny|fate]].]]\u000aChrysippus also argued for the existence of fate based on [[divination]], which he thought there was good evidence for.<ref name="gould144-5">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref> It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental.<ref name="zeller175"/> Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences.<ref name="hicks947">{{Harvnb|Hicks|1911|p=947}}</ref> There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity.<ref name="hicks947"/> To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.<ref name="hicks947"/>\u000a\u000a===God===\u000aThe Stoics believed that the universe is [[God]], and Chrysippus affirmed that "the universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul."<ref name="cicerodenati15">Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 15</ref> It is the guiding principle of the universe, "operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality which embraces all existence."<ref name="cicerodenati15"/> Based on these beliefs, physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] identified Chrysippus as a [[Pandeist]].<ref>Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 233: "Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) herrühren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abkühlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet."</ref>\u000a\u000aChrysippus sought to prove the [[existence of God]], making use of a [[teleological argument]]:\u000a<blockquote>If there is anything that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce the things that are in the universe \u2013 the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.<ref>Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10. Cf. ii. 6 for the fuller version of this argument</ref></blockquote>\u000aChrysippus spoke of God and gods interchangeably. He interpreted the [[Greek gods|gods]] of traditional Greek religion by viewing them as different aspects of the one reality. [[Cicero]] tells us that "he further maintained that aether is that which people call [[Zeus]], and that the air which permeates the seas is [[Poseidon]], and that the earth is what is known by the name of [[Demeter]], and he treated in similar style the names of the other gods."<ref name="cicerodenati15"/> In addition, the universe exists for the benefit of the universal god:\u000a<blockquote>We should infer in the case of a beautiful dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for [[mice]]; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the dwelling-place of the gods.<ref name="cicerodenatiii10">Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10</ref></blockquote>\u000a\u000a===Theodicy===\u000aIn response to the question of how [[evil]] could exist in a good universe, Chrysippus replied "evil cannot be removed, nor is it well that it should be removed."<ref>Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1051 B</ref> Firstly, he argued, following [[Plato]], that it was impossible for good to exist without evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness.<ref name="gelliusvii1">Aulus Gellius, vii. 1</ref> Secondly, apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows.<ref name="gelliusvii1"/> Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are important to the world-order as a whole.<ref>Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1050 E; ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 B</ref> Thus evil is good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus compared evil to the coarse jest in the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]]; for, just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, "so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken with all else, it has its use."<ref>Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 D</ref>\u000a\u000a== Mathematics ==\u000a[[File:Kegelstumpf.png|thumb|right|The puzzle of Democritus. If a cone is sliced horizontally, are the surfaces produced equal or unequal?]]\u000a\u000aChrysippus regarded [[Physical body|bodies]], surfaces, [[Line (geometry)|lines]], [[Location (geography)|places]], the [[Vacuum|void]] and [[time]] as all being [[Infinite divisibility|infinitely divisible]].<ref name="gould116">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=116}}</ref> He determined one of the principal features of the [[infinite set]]: since a man and a finger have an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.<ref name="gould117">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=117}}</ref>\u000a\u000aChrysippus also responded to a problem first posed by [[Democritus]].<ref>Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1079F</ref> If a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is divided by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] parallel to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]; if they are unequal, then the surface of the cone must be [[Step function|stepped]].<ref name="gould117"/> The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal.<ref name="gould118">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=118}}</ref> Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the [[law of excluded middle]] with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern [[infinitesimal calculus]], namely, the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the process of [[Convergent series|convergence towards a limit]].<ref name="gould118"/>\u000a\u000aChrysippus was notable for claiming that "[[1 (number)|one]]" is a [[number]]. One was not always considered a number by the ancient Greeks since they viewed one as that by which things are measured. [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' wrote, "... a measure is not the things measured, but the measure or the One is the beginning of number."<ref name="heath69">{{Harvnb|Heath|1921|p=69}}</ref> Chrysippus asserted that one had "magnitude one" ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f15\u03bd}}),<ref>[[Iamblichus]], ''in Nicom.'', ii. 8f; [[Syrianus]], ''in Arist.
