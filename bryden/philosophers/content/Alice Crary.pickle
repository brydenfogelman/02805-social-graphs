As noted in a contemporary [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/68325-inside-ethics-on-the-demands-of-moral-thought/ review],\u000a\u000a{{quotation|Most contemporary ethicists assume that any objective representation of human and animal life must be developed outside of ethics, using the normatively neutral methods of, for example, the natural sciences. Crary, in contrast, argues that humans and animals have empirically observable moral characteristics, recognition of which is crucial to moral thought, but which are inaccessible to us when we limit ourselves to neutral methods. Good, "world-guided" moral thought, according to Crary, requires the use of capacities such as moral imagination, the exercise of which is elicited by methods (including various narrative techniques) that are characteristic of the arts and humanities. Works employing such methods contribute directly to moral understanding by drawing us into the imaginative exploration of other moral perspectives....Crary embarks on a radical re-visioning of objective reality as including, rather than excluding, moral values. The idea that reality includes objective moral values combines objectivism (the idea that moral judgments are essentially concerned with how things are) with internalism (the idea that moral judgments have direct bearing on our reasons for acting). The dominant stance in philosophical ethics, she points out, is to embrace a hard metaphysic that rejects one or both of these ideas. Crary identifies, as the unquestioned starting point for such a metaphysic, the "familiar and allegedly scientific worldview" (31) according to which the natural sciences have exclusive authority to tell us what reality is objectively like. A central part of [the book] is devoted to showing how both Peter Singer and Christine Korsgaard accept this starting point and embrace, in different ways, the hard metaphysic to which it leads.| A.C. Westlund, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews 2016.07.13''|}}\u000a\u000aAnother [http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/HRO/reviews/content/292/ review] summarizes the main claims of Inside Ethics as follows: \u000a\u000a{{quotation|Among the theses that Crary propounds in service of her ultimate goal are: there are observable and essentially practical moral properties, objectively describing humans and animals requires an ethical sensitivity to those moral properties, being a human and being an animal are by themselves morally significant properties, and literature is an irreplaceable vehicle of moral reflection for grasping the moral significance of humans and other animals....She proposes what I would call a post-Romantic perspective that takes our possibilities for moral response to be equally affective and rational. Crary encourages us to take more seriously the moral thought of those engaged with the most vulnerable humans and animals. This seems to me of the highest importance and part of an expansive program for moral thought that demands further philosophical exploration.| John Hacker-Wright, ''Hypatia Online Reviews 292''|}}\u000a\u000aCrary is a member of a number of international research groups devoted to subjects such as [[feminist philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].\u000a\u000a==Graduate students and teaching==\u000aCrary currently directs eleven PhD theses in the Department of Philosophy at [[The New School for Social Research]].
