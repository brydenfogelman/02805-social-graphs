He worked with his older brother [[Cheng Hao]] (\u7a0b\u9865). Like his brother, he was a student of [[Zhou Dunyi]], a friend of [[Shao Yong]], and a nephew of [[Zhang Zai]]. The five of them along with [[Sima Guang]] are called the '''Six Great Masters''' of the 11th century by [[Zhu Xi]].\u000a\u000aCheng entered the national university in 1056, and received the "presented scholar" degree in 1059. He lived and taught in Luoyang, and declined numerous appointments to high offices. In 1086, he was appointed expositor-in-waiting and gave many lectures to the emperor on [[Confucianism]]. He was more aggressive and obstinate than his brother, and made several enemies, including [[Su Shi]], the leader of the [[Sichuan]] group. In 1097, his enemies were able to ban his teachings, confiscate his properties, and banish him. He was pardoned three years later, but was blacklisted and again his work was banned in 1103. He was finally pardoned in 1106, one year before his death.\u000a\u000aCheng Yi's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (\u4e94\u7ecf\u535a\u58eb; [[w:zh:\u4e94\u7d93\u535a\u58eb|\u4e94\u7d93\u535a\u58eb]]; W\u01d4j\u012bng Bóshì).<ref name="BrunnertHagelstrom2013">{{cite book|author1=H.S.
