V'''William Alvin Howard''' (born 1926) is a [[proof theorist]] best known for his work demonstrating formal similarity between [[intuitionistic logic]] and the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] that has come to be known as the [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]].  He has also been active in the theory of proof-theoretic ordinals.  He earned his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1956 for a dissertation entitled "k-fold recursion and well-ordering".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4242603/Holdings#tabnav | title=Holdings: k-fold recursion and well-ordering | publisher=The University of Chicago Library Catalog | accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref> He was a student of [[Saunders Mac Lane]].\u000a\u000aThe [[Howard ordinal]] (also known as the Bachmann\u2013Howard ordinal) was named after him.\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a*[http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=6461 Entry for ''William Alvin Howard''] at the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]].\u000a*{{cite journal|last = Howard|first = W.
