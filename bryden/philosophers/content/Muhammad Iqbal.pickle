Discontent with factional leaders like Muhammad Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was an influential force in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:\u000a\u000a{{quote|I know you are a busy man but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name="igbalandpakmovement"/>\u000a}}\u000a\u000aWhile Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940.

Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League.

The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.\u000a\u000aIqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name="books.google.co.uk"/> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim provinces in India. Under a single Indian union he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects especially with regard to their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aIqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932.

S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250\u201352}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.\u000a\u000aHe thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''\u2014that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. However, he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would construe a [[theocracy]], even as he rejected secularism and nationalism. The latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League, he reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the [[Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933|Third round-Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.\u000a\u000aHe would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians averse to the League. Many unnoticed accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two nation theory.\u000a\u000a===Patron of the Journal Tolu-e-Islam===\u000a[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first journal of ''Tolu-e-Islam''.]]\u000a\u000aIqbal was the first patron of [[The Journal Tolu-e-Islam|Tolu-e-Islam]], a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India.

The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious, spiritual perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|accessdate=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-e-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of "Khudi," or "Self."<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/><ref name="books.google.co.uk"/> Iqbal's use of the term "Khudi" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|"Rooh"]] mentioned in the Quran. "Rooh" is that divine spark which is present in every human being, and was present in Adam, for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam. One has to make a great journey of transformation to realise that divine spirit.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aThe same concept was used by Farid ud Din Attar in his "Mantaq-ul-Tair". He proves by various means that the whole universe obeys the will of the "Self." Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the "Self" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the "Self" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aIn his ''[[Rumuz-e-Bekhudi]]'' (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his individual characteristics intact, but once this is achieved he should sacrifice his personal ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the "Self" outside of society. Also in Persian and published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he is true throughout to Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive analogous aspects of other religions. The ''Rumuz-e-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in the ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-e-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aIqbal's 1924 publication, the ''Payam-e-Mashriq'' (''The Message of the East'') is closely connected to the ''West-östlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardour and dynamism. He explains that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented his book "Payam-e Mashreq" to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]] in which he admired the liberal movements of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name=" A Spiritual Bridge between East and West"/>\u000a\u000aThe ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' (''[[Persian Psalms]]''), published in 1927, includes the poems ''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed'' (''Garden of New Secrets'') and ''[[Bandagi Nama]]'' (''Book of Slavery''). In ''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed'', Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight, showing how it affects and concerns the world of action. ''Bandagi Nama'' denounces slavery by attempting to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aIqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' (''Book of Javed'') is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' ("A stream full of life") guided by Rumi, "the master," through various heavens and spheres, and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage re-living a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslim who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] respectively by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. At the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and provides guidance to the "new generation."<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aHis love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry.

It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/> The poems he wrote up to 1905\u2014the year he left for England\u2014reflect patriotism and imagery of nature, including the ''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]'' (The song of India),<ref name=" A Spiritual Bridge between East and West"/> and ''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]'' (The song of the Community). The second set of poems date from 1905-1908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aIqbal's works were in Persian for most  of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, the ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' (Wings of [[Gabriel]]) is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry, and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]], [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a\u000aThe ''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' (''What are we to do, O Nations of the East?'') includes the poem ''Musafir'' (''Traveler''). Again, Iqbal depicts [[Rumi]] as a character and an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and [[Sufi]] perceptions is given. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. ''Musafir'' is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counselled to learn the "secret of Islam" and to "build up the self" within themselves.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/> Iqbal's final work was the ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and [[epigram]]s in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. Profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.<ref name="allamaiqbal.com"/>\u000a[[File:Miqbal4.jpg|thumb|right|Iqbal wearing a [[bow tie]].]]\u000a\u000aIqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals which was written in London during his days of studying there.
