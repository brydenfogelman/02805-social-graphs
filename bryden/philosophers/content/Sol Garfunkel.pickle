Since 1980, he has served as the executive director of the award winning [[non-profit organization]] "[[Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications]]",<ref>[http://www.comap.com COMAP]</ref> working with teachers, students, and business people to create learning environments where mathematics is used to investigate and model real issues in our world.\u000a\u000aGarfunkel is best known for hosting the 1987 [[PBS]] series titled "For All Practical Purposes: An Introduction to Contemporary Mathematics", followed by the 1991 series, "Algebra: In Simplest Terms", both often used in classrooms.\u000a\u000aAt the age of 24, Garfunkel received his [[PhD]] in [[Mathematical Logic]] from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. While in attendance he worked with [[Howard Jerome Keisler]], [[Michael D. Morley]], and [[Stephen Kleene]]. Garfunkel then worked at [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Connecticut]] at [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]].\u000a\u000aGarfunkel continued his work advocating for the improvement of mathematics in public school systems. He coauthored the article "How to Fix Our Math Education"<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/opinion/how-to-fix-our-math-education.html?scp=1&sq=sol%20garfunkel&st=cse Op Ed] Published: August 24, 2011 in the [[New York Times]]</ref> with [[David Mumford]], emeritus professor of mathematics at [[Brown University]].
