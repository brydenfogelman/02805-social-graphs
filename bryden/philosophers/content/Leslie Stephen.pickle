His father was Colonial Undersecretary of State and a noted [[abolitionist]]. He was the fourth of five children, his siblings including [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] (1829\u20131894) and [[Caroline Emilia Stephen]] (1834\u20131909).\u000a\u000aHis family had belonged to the [[Clapham Sect]], the early 19th century group of mainly [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian [[social reform]]ers.  At his father's house he saw a good deal of the [[Zachary Macaulay|Macaulays]], [[James Spedding]], Sir [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Henry Taylor]] and [[Nassau William Senior|Nassau Senior]]. After studying at [[Eton College]], [[King's College London]] and [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. (20th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]) in 1854 and M.A. in 1857, Stephen remained for several years a fellow and tutor of his college.<ref>{{acad|id=STFN850L|name=Stephen, Leslie}}</ref> He recounted some of his experiences in a chapter in his ''Life of Fawcett'' as well as in some less formal ''Sketches from Cambridge: By a Don'' (1865). These sketches were reprinted from the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', to the proprietor of which, [[George Murray Smith]], he had been introduced by his brother.\u000a\u000a=== Marriage ===\u000a\u000a==== (1) Harriet (Minny) Thackeray 1867\u20131875====\u000a[[File:Harriet and Leslie Stephen 1867.jpg|thumb|Harriet and Leslie Stephen, 1867]]\u000a[[File:Harriet Marian Thackeray Stephen, Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Harriet's grave, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\u000aThe family connections included that of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. His brother, Fitzjames had been a friend of Thackeray's and assisted in the disposition of his estate when he died in 1863. His sister Caroline met Thackeray's daughters, [[Anne Isabella Thackeray|Anny]] (1837\u20131919) and Minny (Harriet Marian Thackeray 1840\u20131875) when they were mutual guests of [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] (of whom, see later). This led to an invitation to visit from Leslie Stephen's mother, Lady Stephen, where the sisters met him. They also met at George Murray Smith's house at Hampstead. Minny and Leslie became engaged on December 4, 1866 and married on June 19, 1867. After the wedding they travelled to the Swiss Alps and northern Italy, and on return to England lived at the Thackeray sister's home at 16 Onslow Gardens with Anny, who was a novelist. In the spring of 1868 Minny [[miscarried]] but recovered sufficiently for the couple to tour the eastern United States. Minny miscarried again in 1869, but became pregnant again in 1870 and on December 7 gave birth to their daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870\u20131945). Laura was premature, weighing three pounds. In March 1873 Thackeray and the Stephens moved to 8 Southwell Gardens. The couple travelled extensively, and by 1875 Minny was pregnant again, but this time was in poor health. On November 27 she developed convulsions, and died the following day of [[eclampsia]].{{sfn|Bicknell|1996}}\u000a\u000aAfter Minny's death, Leslie Stephen continued to live with Anny, but they moved to 11 Hyde Park gate South in 1876, next door to her widowed friend and collaborator, Julia Duckworth. Leslie Stephen and his daughter were also cared for by his sister, the writer [[Caroline Emelia Stephen]], although Leslie described her as "Silly Milly" and her books as "little works".<ref name=lewis>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Alison M|title=Caroline Stephen and her niece, Virginia Woolf|journal=JOURNAL OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF QUAKERS IN THE ARTS|date=Spring 2001|issue=21|url=http://www.quaker.org/fqa/types/t21-woolf.html|accessdate=10 December 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Bloom|Maynard|1994}}{{sfn|Bicknell|1996}} Meanwhile, Anny was falling in love with her younger cousin [[Richmond Ritchie]], to Leslie Stephen's consternation. Ritchie became a constant visitor and they became engaged in May 1877, and were married on August 2. At the same time Leslie Stephen was seeing more and more of Julia Duckworth.\u000a\u000a==== (2) Julia Duckworth 1878\u20131895====\u000a[[File:Julia Duckworth in Garden, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|Julia Duckworth by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], 1872]]\u000aHis second marriage was to [[Julia Stephen|Julia Prinsep Duckworth]] (née Jackson, 1846\u20131895). Julia had been born in India and after returning to England she became a model for [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painters such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref>[http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/rarebook/exhibitions/stephen/31a.htm Smith College libraries biography of Julia Prinsep Stephen]</ref> In 1867 she had married Herbert Duckworth (1833 \u2212 1870) by whom  she had three children prior to his death in 1870.\u000a\u000aLeslie Stephen and Julia Duckworth were married on March 26, 1878.

Leslie Stephen became a member of the College's governing College Corporation.<ref name=Harrison>[[J. F. C. Harrison]], ''A History of the Working Men's College (1854\u20131954),'' Routledge Kegan Paul (1954)</ref>\u000a\u000aStephen was an [[Honorary Fellow]] of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], and received the honorary degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (D. Litt.) from the [[University of Cambridge]] and from the [[University of Oxford]] (November 1901<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=27 November 1901 |page_number=6 |issue=36623| }}</ref>).\u000aWhile at Cambridge, Stephen became an [[Anglican]] clergyman. In 1865, having renounced his religious beliefs, and after a visit to the United States two years earlier, where he had formed lasting friendships with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes,&nbsp;Jr.]], [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], he settled in London and became a journalist, eventually editing the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' in 1871 where [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[William Edward Norris|W.&nbsp;E. Norris]], [[Henry James]], and [[James Payn]] figured among his contributors.\u000a\u000aIn his spare time, he participated in athletics and [[mountaineering]]. He also contributed to the ''Saturday Review'', ''Fraser'', ''Macmillan'', the ''Fortnightly'', and other periodicals. He was already known as a climber, as a contributor to ''Peaks, Passes and Glaciers'' (1862), and as one of the earliest presidents of the [[Alpine Club]], when, in 1871, in commemoration of his own [[first ascent]]s in the [[Alps]], he published ''The Playground of Europe'', which immediately became a mountaineering classic, drawing\u2014together with [[Whymper]]'s ''Scrambles Amongst the Alps''\u2014successive generations of its readers to the Alps.\u000a\u000aDuring the eleven years of his editorship, in addition to three volumes of critical studies, he made two valuable contributions to philosophical history and theory. The first was ''The History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'' (1876 and 1881). This work was generally recognised as an important addition to philosophical literature and led immediately to Stephen's election at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1877. The second was ''The Science of Ethics'' (1882). It was extensively adopted as a textbook on the subject and made him the best-known proponent of [[evolutionary ethics]] in late-nineteenth-century Britain.\u000a\u000aStephen also served as the first editor (1885\u201391) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.\u000a\u000a=== Mountaineering ===\u000a[[File:Sir Leslie Stephen by George Frederic Watts 1878.jpeg|thumb|right|Leslie Stephen painted by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1878.]]\u000aStephen was one of the most prominent figures in the [[golden age of alpinism]] (the period between [[Alfred Wills|Wills]]'s ascent of the [[Wetterhorn]] in 1854 and [[Whymper]]'s ascent of the [[Matterhorn]] in 1865) during which many major alpine peaks saw their first ascents. Joining the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in 1857 (the year of its formation), Stephen made the first ascent, usually in the company of his favourite Swiss guide [[Melchior Anderegg]], of the following peaks:\u000a*[[Wildstrubel]] \u2013 11 September 1858 with [[Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff|T.
