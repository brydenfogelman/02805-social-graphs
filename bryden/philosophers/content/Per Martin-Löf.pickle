He is internationally renowned for his work on the foundations of probability, statistics, mathematical logic, and computer science.  Since the late 1970s, Martin-Löf's publications have been mainly in [[logic]]. In [[philosophical logic]], Martin-Löf has wrestled with the philosophy of [[logical consequence]] and [[Edmund Husserl#Philosophy of logic and mathematics|judgment]], partly inspired by the work of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. In [[mathematical logic]], Martin-Löf has been active in developing [[intuitionistic type theory]] as a constructive foundation of mathematics; Martin-Löf's work on type theory has influenced [[computer science]].<ref>See e.g. {{citation|title=Programming in Martin-Löf \u2019s Type Theory: An Introduction|url=http://www.ens-lyon.fr/denif/data/martin_lof_prog/1990/contenu/book.pdf|first1=Bengt|last1=Nordström|first2=Kent|last2=Petersson|first3=Jan M.|last3=Smith|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990}}.</ref>\u000a\u000aUntil his retirement in 2009,<ref>[http://www2.math.uu.se/PFM/ Philosophy and Foundations of Mathematics: Epistemological and Ontological Aspects.

Kolmogorov]]. He wrote a 1966 article ''On the definition of random sequences'' that gave the first suitable definition of a random sequence.\u000a\u000aEarlier researchers such as [[Richard von Mises]] had attempted to formalize the notion of a [[randomness test|test for randomness]] in order to define a random sequence as one that passed all tests for randomness; however, the precise notion of a randomness test was left vague. Martin-Löf's key insight was to use the [[theory of computation]] to define formally the notion of a test for randomness. This contrasts with the idea of randomness in [[probability]]; in that theory, no particular element of a sample space can be said to be random.\u000a\u000aMartin-Löf randomness has since been shown to admit many equivalent characterizations &mdash; in terms of [[data compression|compression]], randomness tests, and [[gambling]] &mdash; that bear little outward resemblance to the original definition, but each of which satisfies our intuitive notion of properties that random sequences ought to have: random sequences should be incompressible, they should pass statistical tests for randomness, and it should be impossible to make money [[betting]] on them. The existence of these multiple definitions of Martin-Löf randomness, and the stability of these definitions under different models of computation, give evidence that Martin-Löf randomness is a fundamental property of mathematics and not an accident of Martin-Löf's particular model. The thesis that the definition of Martin-Löf randomness "correctly" captures the intuitive notion of randomness has been called the "Martin-Löf-[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] Thesis"; it is somewhat similar to the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]].<ref>[[Jean-Paul Delahaye]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=EDoXdoz-qYQC&pg=PA145&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0 Randomness, Unpredictability and Absence of Order], in ''Philosophy of Probability'', p. 145\u2013167, Springer 1993.</ref>\u000a\u000aFollowing Martin-Löf's work, [[algorithmic information theory]] defines a random string as one that cannot be produced from any computer program that is shorter than the string ([[Chaitin\u2013Kolmogorov randomness]]); i.e. a string whose [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is at least the length of the string. This is a different meaning from the usage of the term in statistics. Whereas statistical randomness refers to the ''process'' that produces the string (e.g. flipping a coin to produce each bit will randomly produce a string), algorithmic randomness refers to the ''string itself''. Algorithmic information theory separates random from nonrandom strings in a way that is relatively invariant to the [[model of computation]] being used.\u000a\u000aAn [[algorithmically random sequence]] is an ''infinite'' sequence of characters, all of whose prefixes (except possibly a finite number of exceptions) are strings that are "close to" algorithmically random (their length is within a constant of their Kolmogorov complexity).\u000a\u000a== Mathematical statistics ==\u000a\u000aPer Martin-Löf has done important research in [[mathematical statistics]], which (in the Swedish tradition) includes [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]].\u000a\u000a=== Bird-watching and sex determination ===\u000a[[File:Calidris-alpina-001 edit.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Dunlin]] ''(Calidris alpina)'']]\u000a{{See also|Bird watching|Bird ringing|Mark and recapture|Ornithology}}\u000a\u000aPer Martin-Löf began [[bird watching]] in his youth and remains an enthusiastic bird-watcher.<ref>[[George A.

Martin-Löf's first paper discussed the problem of estimating the mortality rates of the [[Dunlin]] species, using [[capture-recapture]] methods. A second problem of missing data arises with studying the sex of birds. The problem of determining the [[biological sex]] of a bird, which is extremely difficult for humans, is one of the first examples in Martin-Löf's lectures on [[statistical model]]s.\u000a\u000a=== Probability on algebraic structures ===\u000a{{See also|probability distribution|harmonic analysis|Haar measure|Laplace transform|semigroup}}\u000aMartin-Löf wrote a licenciate thesis on probability on algebraic structures, particularly semigroups, a research program led by [[Ulf Grenander]] at Stockholm University.<ref>Martin-Löf, P.

In this work, Martin-Löf's previous research on probability measures on semigroups led to a notion of "repetitive structure" and a novel treatment of sufficient statistics, in which one-parameter [[exponential family|exponential families]] were characterized. He provided a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] approach to [[Statistical model#Nested models|nested statistical models]], using finite-sample principles. Before (and after) Martin-Löf, such nested models have often been tested using chi-square hypothesis tests, whose justifications are only asymptotic (and so irrelevant to real problems, which always have finite samples).<ref name=kolrand/>\u000a\u000a==== Expectation maximization method for exponential families ====\u000a{{See also|Missing data|Expectation maximization method}}\u000aMartin-Löf's student, Rolf Sundberg, developed a detailed analysis of the [[expectation-maximization]] [[EM algorithm|(EM) method]] for estimation using data from exponential families, especially with [[missing data]].

Martin-Löf's first draft article on type theory dates back to 1971.  This [[impredicative]] theory generalized [[Jean-Yves Girard|Girard's]] [[System F]]. However, this system turned out to be [[consistency proof|inconsistent]] due to [[Girard's paradox]] which was discovered by Girard when studying System U, an inconsistent extension of System F. This experience led Per Martin-Löf to develop the philosophical foundations of [[Intuitionistic type theory|type theory]], his ''meaning explanation'', a form of [[proof-theoretic semantics]], which justifies [[impredicative|predicative]] type theory as presented in his 1984 Bibliopolis book, and extended in a number of increasingly philosophical texts, such as his influential ''On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws''.\u000a\u000aThe 1984 type theory was extensional while the type theory presented in the book by Nordström ''et al.'' in 1990, which was heavily influenced by his later ideas, intensional, and more amenable to being implemented on a computer.\u000a\u000aMartin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory developed the notion of [[dependent type]]s and directly influenced the development of the [[calculus of constructions]] and the [[LF (logical framework)|logical framework LF]]. A number of popular computer-based proof systems are based on type theory, for example [[NuPRL]], LEGO, [[Coq]], ALF, [[Agda theorem prover|Agda]], [[Twelf]], [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]] and [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]].\u000a\u000a==Awards==\u000aMartin-Löf is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/KVA_Root/eng/contact/searchcontacts/detail.asp?PersonID=224|title=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: Per Martin-Löf|accessdate=2009-05-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and of the [[Academia Europaea]].<ref name="ae"/>\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a{{Div col||20em}}\u000a* [[Franz Brentano]]\u000a* [[Rudolf Carnap]]\u000a* [[Michael Dummett]]\u000a* [[Gottlob Frege]]\u000a* [[Ulf Grenander]]\u000a* [[Jaakko Hintikka]]\u000a* [[Edmund Husserl]]\u000a* [[Andrei N.
