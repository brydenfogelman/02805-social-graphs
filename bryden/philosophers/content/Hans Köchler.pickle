These were his formative philosophical years; he initially developed an interest in [[existential philosophy]], [[transcendental philosophy]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. In particular, he undertook an epistemological critique of Husserl's transcendental idealism]<ref>"The 'A priori' Moment of the Subject-Object-Dialectic in Transcendental Phenomenology: The Relationship between 'A priori' and 'Ideality'," in: ''Analecta Husserliana'', Vol. 3 (1974), pp. 183-198.</ref>  and interpreted Heidegger's philosophy of Being in the sense of social critique,<ref>''Skepsis und Gesellschaftskritik im Denken Martin Heideggers''.

He also dealt with the applicability of democracy in inter-state relations (''Democracy in International Relations'', 1986). Legal theory led him to questions of political philosophy, and in particular a critique of the representative paradigm of democracy.  During the 1990s Köchler got increasingly involved in questions of [[New world order (politics)|world order]]\u2014including the role and philosophical foundations of civilizational dialogue\u2014and in what he has called the dialectic relationship between [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[law]]. On the basis of these reflections, he made major proposals for the reform of the United Nations Organization, in particular the Security Council, and for a comprehensive system of international criminal justice.\u000a\u000aKöchler's bibliography contains more than 380 books, reports and scholarly articles in several languages (Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Spanish, Serbo-Croat, Turkish).
