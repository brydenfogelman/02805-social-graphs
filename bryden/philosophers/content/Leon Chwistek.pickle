His interests in the 1930s were in a general system of philosophy of science, which was published in a book translated in English 1948 as ''The Limits of Science''.<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/v078l3n714589036/</ref>\u000a\u000aIn the 1920s-30s, many [[Europe]]an philosophers attempted to reform traditional philosophy by means of [[mathematical logic]]. Leon Chwistek did not believe that such reform could succeed. He thought that [[reality]] could not be described in one homogeneous system, based on the principles of [[formal logic]], because there was not one reality but many.\u000a\u000aChwistek demolishes the [[axiomatic method]] by demonstrating that the extant axiomatic systems are inconsistent.<ref>First chapter of Chwistek, ''The Limits of Science''</ref>\u000a\u000a==Artist==\u000aChwistek developed his theory of the multiplicity of realities first with regard to the [[art]]s. He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.\u000a\u000aThe four types of realities were:\u000a:1. popular reality (common-sense realism)\u000a:2. physical reality (constructed by physics)\u000a:3. phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)\u000a:4. visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).\u000a\u000aThe types of painting corresponding to the above were:\u000a:1. [[Primitivism]]\u000a:2. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]\u000a:3. [[Impressionism]]\u000a:4. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]\u000aChwistek never intended his views to constitute a new [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory. He was a defender of "common sense" against metaphysics and irrational feeling. His theory of plural reality was merely an attempt to specify the various ways in which the term, \u201creal,\u201d is used.\u000a \u000aChwistek's fellow-artist and closest friend, [[Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], harshly criticized his  philosophical views.  Witkiewicz\u2019s own philosophy was based on a [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]ic character to the individual's existence, embracing a multiplicity of existences, with the world being made up of a multiplicity of Particular Existences.\u000a<gallery class="center" widths=170 heights=130>\u000aLeon Chwistek Szermierka 1919.jpg|Fencing 1919\u000aLeon Chwistek Portret Tytusa Czy\u017cewskiego 1920.jpg|Portrait Tytus Czy\u017cewski 1920\u000aChwistek Feast.jpg|Feast 1925 \u000aLeon Chwistek Wenus 1928.jpg|Venus 1928\u000aLeon Chwistek Akt kobiety 1939.jpg|Nude 1939\u000a</gallery>\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a* ''The limits of science.
