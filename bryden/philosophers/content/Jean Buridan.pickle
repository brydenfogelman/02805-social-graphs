His name is most familiar through the [[thought experiment]] known as [[Buridan's ass]] (a thought experiment which does not appear in his extant writings).\u000a\u000a==Career==\u000aBorn, most probably, in [[Béthune]], France, Buridan studied and later taught at the [[University of Paris]]. Unusually, he spent his academic life in the faculty of arts, rather than obtaining the doctorate in [[Theology]] that typically prepared the way for a career in [[Philosophy]]. He further maintained his intellectual independence by remaining a [[Secular clergy|secular cleric]], rather than joining a [[religious Order]]. By 1340, his confidence had grown sufficiently for him to launch an attack on his predecessor, [[William of Ockham]]. Buridan also wrote on solutions to [[paradox]]es such as the [[liar paradox]]. An ordinance of [[Louis XI of France]] in 1473, directed against the [[nominalism|nominalists]], prohibited the reading of his works.\u000a\u000aThe [[bishop]] [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], himself renowned as a [[logician]], was among the most notable of his students.\u000a\u000a==Impetus theory==\u000a{{main|Theory of impetus}}\u000aThe concept of ''inertia'' was alien to the physics of [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle, and his [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] followers held that a body was only maintained in motion by the action of a continuous external [[force]]. Thus, in the Aristotelian view, a projectile moving through the air would owe its continuing motion to ''eddies'' or ''vibrations'' in the surrounding medium, a phenomenon known as ''[[antiperistasis]]''. In the absence of a proximate force, the body would come to rest almost immediately.\u000a\u000aJean Buridan, following in the footsteps of [[John Philoponus]] and [[Avicenna]], proposed that motion was maintained by some property of the body, imparted when it was set in motion. Buridan named the motion-maintaining property ''impetus''. Moreover, he rejected the view that the impetus dissipated spontaneously (this is the big difference between Buridan's theory of impetus and his predecessors), asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and [[gravity]] which might be opposing its impetus. Buridan further held that the impetus of a body increased with the speed with which it was set in motion, and with its quantity of matter. Clearly, Buridan's impetus is closely related to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Buridan saw impetus as ''causing'' the motion of the object. Buridan anticipated [[Isaac Newton]] when he wrote:\u000a\u000a:''...after leaving the arm of the thrower, the projectile would be moved by an impetus given to it by the thrower and would continue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the resistance, and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished and corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something inclining it to a contrary motion'' (''Questions on Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' XII.9).<ref>T. F. Glick, S. J. Livesay, F. Wallis, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&dq= Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine:an Encyclopedia]'', 2005, p. 107.</ref>\u000a\u000aBuridan used the theory of impetus to give an accurate qualitative account of the motion of projectiles but he ultimately saw his theory as a correction to Aristotle, maintaining core peripatetic beliefs including a fundamental qualitative difference between motion and rest.\u000a\u000aThe theory of impetus was also adapted to explain [[celestial mechanics|celestial]] phenomena in terms of ''circular impetus''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\u000a\u000a==Apocryphal stories and anecdotes about personal life==\u000aApocryphal stories abound about his reputed amorous affairs and adventures which are enough to show that he enjoyed a reputation as a glamorous and mysterious figure in Paris life. In particular, a rumour held that he was sentenced to be thrown in a sack into the River [[Seine]], but was ultimately saved through the ingenuity of a student. [[François Villon]] alludes to this  in his famous poem [[Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis]]. Buridan also seems to have had an unusual facility for attracting academic funding which suggests that he was indeed a charismatic figure.\u000a\u000a==Selected works in English translation==\u000a* [[George Edward Hughes|Hughes, G.E.]] (1982).
