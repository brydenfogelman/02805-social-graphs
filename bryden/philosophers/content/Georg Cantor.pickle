Cantor established the importance of [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the members of two sets, defined [[infinite set|infinite]] and [[well-order|well-ordered sets]], and proved that the [[real number]]s are more numerous than the [[natural number]]s. In fact, Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an "[[infinity]] of infinities". He defined the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers and their arithmetic.

Georg, the oldest of six children, was regarded as an outstanding violinist. His grandfather [[Franz Böhm (musician)|Franz Böhm]] (1788\u20131846) (the violinist [[Joseph Böhm]]'s brother) was a well-known musician and soloist in a Russian imperial orchestra.<ref>[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_music/924/\u0411\u0451\u043c ru: The musical encyclopedia (\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f)]</ref> Cantor's father had been a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Bourse|Saint Petersburg stock exchange]]; when he became ill, the family moved to Germany in 1856, first to [[Wiesbaden]] then to [[Frankfurt]], seeking winters milder than those of Saint Petersburg. In 1860, Cantor graduated with distinction from the Realschule in [[Darmstadt]]; his exceptional skills in mathematics, [[trigonometry]] in particular, were noted. In 1862, Cantor entered the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]]. After receiving a substantial inheritance upon his father's death in 1863, Cantor shifted his studies to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], attending lectures by [[Leopold Kronecker]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Ernst Kummer]]. He spent the summer of 1866 at the [[University of Göttingen]], then and later a center for mathematical research.\u000a\u000a===Teacher and researcher===\u000aCantor submitted his [[dissertation]] on number theory at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1867. After teaching briefly in a Berlin girls' school, Cantor took up a position at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], where he spent his entire career. He was awarded the requisite [[habilitation]] for his thesis, also on number theory, which he presented in 1869 upon his appointment at Halle.<ref>{{cite web |author1=O'Connor, John J |author2=Robertson, Edmund F |year=1998 |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor.html |title=Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor |publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics}}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn 1874, Cantor married Vally Guttmann. They had six children, the last (Rudolph) born in 1886. Cantor was able to support a family despite modest academic pay, thanks to his inheritance from his father. During his honeymoon in the [[Harz|Harz mountains]], Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with [[Richard Dedekind]], whom he had met two years earlier while on Swiss holiday.\u000a\u000aCantor was promoted to Extraordinary Professor in 1872 and made full Professor in 1879. To attain the latter rank at the age of 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a [[professor|chair]] at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible.<ref name="daub163">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 163.</ref> Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague,<ref name="daub34">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 34.</ref> perceiving him as a "corrupter of youth" for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians.<ref>[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89 ''15n.''</ref> Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work. Kronecker, now seen as one of the founders of the [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive viewpoint in mathematics]], disliked much of Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Cantor came to believe that Kronecker's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle.\u000a\u000aIn 1881, Cantor's Halle colleague [[Eduard Heine]] died, creating a vacant chair. Halle accepted Cantor's suggestion that it be offered to [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Heinrich M. Weber]] and [[Franz Mertens]], in that order, but each declined the chair after being offered it. Friedrich Wangerin was eventually appointed, but he was never close to Cantor.\u000a\u000aIn 1882, the mathematical correspondence between Cantor and [[Richard Dedekind]] came to an end, apparently as a result of Dedekind's declining the chair at Halle.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 2\u20133; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 354\u2013355.</ref> Cantor also began another important correspondence, with [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]] in Sweden, and soon began to publish in Mittag-Leffler's journal ''Acta Mathematica''. But in 1885, Mittag-Leffler was concerned about the philosophical nature and new terminology in a paper Cantor had submitted to ''Acta''.<ref name="daub138">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 138.</ref> He asked Cantor to withdraw the paper from ''Acta'' while it was in proof, writing that it was "...&nbsp;about one hundred years too soon." Cantor complied, but then curtailed his relationship and correspondence with Mittag-Leffler, writing to a third party:\u000a\u000a{{quote|Had Mittag-Leffler had his way, I should have to wait until the year 1984, which to me seemed too great a demand! ...

A passage from one of these letters is revealing of the damage to Cantor's self-confidence:\u000a\u000a{{quote|... I don't know when I shall return to the continuation of my scientific work.

He also began an intense study of [[Elizabethan literature]] thinking there might be evidence that [[Francis Bacon]] wrote the plays attributed to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (see [[Shakespearean authorship question]]); this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets, published in 1896 and 1897.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 281\u2013283.</ref>\u000a\u000aCantor recovered soon thereafter, and subsequently made further important contributions, including his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]. However, he never again attained the high level of his remarkable papers of 1874\u201384. He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted.\u000a\u000aIn 1890, Cantor was instrumental in founding the ''[[Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung]]'' and chaired its first meeting in Halle in 1891, where he first introduced his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]; his reputation was strong enough, despite Kronecker's opposition to his work, to ensure he was elected as the first president of this society. Setting aside the animosity Kronecker had displayed towards him, Cantor invited him to address the meeting, but Kronecker was unable to do so because his wife was dying from injuries sustained in a skiing accident at the time.\u000a\u000a===Late years===\u000aAfter Cantor's 1884 hospitalization, there is no record that he was in any [[sanatorium]] again until 1899.<ref name="daub282">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 282.</ref> Soon after that second hospitalization, Cantor's youngest son Rudolph died suddenly (while Cantor was delivering a lecture on his views on [[Baconian theory]] and [[William Shakespeare]]), and this tragedy drained Cantor of much of his passion for mathematics.<ref name="daub283">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 283.</ref> Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903. One year later, he was outraged and agitated by a paper presented by [[Julius König]] at the Third [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. The paper attempted to prove that the basic tenets of transfinite set theory were false.  Since the paper had been read in front of his daughters and colleagues, Cantor perceived himself as having been publicly humiliated.<ref>For a discussion of König's paper see [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 248\u2013250. For Cantor's reaction, see [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 248, 283.</ref> Although [[Ernst Zermelo]] demonstrated less than a day later that König's proof had failed, Cantor remained shaken, and momentarily questioning God.<ref name="daub248">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 248.</ref> Cantor suffered from chronic depression for the rest of his life, for which he was excused from teaching on several occasions and repeatedly confined in various sanatoria. The events of 1904 preceded a series of hospitalizations at intervals of two or three years.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 283\u2013284.</ref> He did not abandon mathematics completely, however, lecturing on the paradoxes of set theory ([[Burali-Forti paradox]], [[Cantor's paradox]], and [[Russell's paradox]]) to a meeting of the ''Deutsche Mathematiker\u2013Vereinigung'' in 1903, and attending the International Congress of Mathematicians at [[Heidelberg]] in 1904.\u000a\u000aIn 1911, Cantor was one of the distinguished foreign scholars invited to attend the 500th anniversary of the founding of the [[University of St. Andrews]] in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet [[Bertrand Russell]], whose newly published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' repeatedly cited Cantor's work, but this did not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person.\u000a\u000aCantor retired in 1913, living in poverty and suffering from [[Malnutrition|malnourishment]] during [[World War I]].<ref name="daub284">[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 284.</ref> The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war.

No one had realized that set theory had any nontrivial content. Before Cantor, there were only finite sets (which are easy to understand) and "the infinite" (which was considered a topic for philosophical, rather than mathematical, discussion). By proving that there are (infinitely) many possible sizes for infinite sets, Cantor established that set theory was not trivial, and it needed to be studied. [[Axiomatic set theory|Set theory]] has come to play the role of a [[foundations of mathematics|foundational theory]] in modern mathematics, in the sense that it interprets propositions about mathematical objects (for example, numbers and functions) from all the traditional areas of mathematics (such as [[algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]]) in a single theory, and provides a standard set of axioms to prove or disprove them. The basic concepts of set theory are now used throughout mathematics.<ref>{{citation|title=Axiomatic Set Theory|first=Patrick|last=Suppes|authorlink=Patrick Suppes|year=1972|publisher=Dover|isbn=9780486616308|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sxr4LrgJGeAC&pg=PA1|quote=With a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.  ... As a consequence, many fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics may be reduced to questions about set theory.}}</ref>\u000a\u000aIn one of his earliest papers,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cantor|1874}}</ref> Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is "more numerous" than the set of [[natural number]]s; this showed, for the first time, that there exist infinite sets of different [[Cardinality|sizes]]. He was also the first to appreciate the importance of [[one-to-one correspondence]]s (hereinafter denoted "1-to-1 correspondence") in set theory. He used this concept to define [[finite set|finite]] and [[infinite set]]s, subdividing the latter into [[countable set|denumerable]] (or countably infinite) sets and [[uncountable set]]s (nondenumerable infinite sets).<ref>A [[countable set]] is a set which is either finite or denumerable; the denumerable sets are therefore the infinite countable sets. However, this terminology is not universally followed, and sometimes "denumerable" is used as a synonym for "countable".</ref>\u000a\u000aCantor developed important concepts in [[topology]] and their relation to [[cardinality]]. For example, he showed that the [[Cantor set]] is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]], but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the [[Rational number|rationals]] are everywhere dense, but countable.\u000a\u000aCantor introduced fundamental constructions in set theory, such as the [[power set]] of a set ''A'', which is the set of all possible [[subset]]s of ''A''. He later proved that the size of the power set of ''A'' is strictly larger than the size of ''A'', even when ''A'' is an infinite set; this result soon became known as [[Cantor's theorem]]. Cantor developed an entire theory and [[Ordinal arithmetic|arithmetic of infinite sets]], called [[Cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[Ordinal number|ordinals]], which extended the arithmetic of the natural numbers. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter <math>\u005caleph</math> ([[aleph number|aleph]]) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter \u03c9 ([[omega]]). This notation is still in use today.\u000a\u000aThe ''[[Continuum hypothesis]]'', introduced by Cantor, was presented by [[David Hilbert]] as the first of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three open problems]] in his address at the 1900 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium.<ref name="encomium">{{Citation |surname=Reid|given= Constance|year=1996|title=Hilbert|place=New York|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-04999-1|page=\u000a177}}</ref> The US philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] praised Cantor's set theory, and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]] and [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator [[Philip Jourdain]] on the history of [[set theory]] and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.\u000a\u000a===Number theory, trigonometric series and ordinals===\u000aCantor's first ten papers were on [[number theory]], his thesis topic. At the suggestion of [[Eduard Heine]], the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Heine proposed that Cantor solve [[Open problem|an open problem]] that had eluded [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Rudolf Lipschitz]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and Heine himself: the uniqueness of the representation of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] by [[trigonometric series]]. Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices ''n'' in the ''n''th [[derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> of a set ''S'' of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with ''S'' as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had ''S''<sub>1</sub> as its set of zeros, where ''S''<sub>1</sub> is the set of [[limit point]]s of ''S''. If ''S''<sub>''k+1''</sub> is the set of limit points of ''S''<sub>''k''</sub>, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are ''S''<sub>''k+1''</sub>. Because the sets ''S''<sub>''k''</sub> were closed, they contained their [[Limit point]]s, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets ''S'', ''S''<sub>1</sub>, ''S''<sub>2</sub>, ''S''<sub>3</sub>,... formed a limit set, which we would now call ''S''<sub>''\u03c9''</sub>, and then he noticed that ''S''<sub>\u03c9</sub> would also have to have a set of limit points ''S''<sub>\u03c9+1</sub>, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ''\u03c9'', ''\u03c9''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, ''\u03c9''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, ...<ref>{{Citation|last1=Cooke|first1=Roger|title=Uniqueness of trigonometric series and descriptive set theory, 1870\u20131985|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=45|page=281|year=1993|doi=10.1007/BF01886630|issue=4|postscript=.}}</ref>\u000a\u000aBetween 1870 and 1872, Cantor published more papers on trigonometric series, and also a paper defining [[irrational number]]s as [[Sequence space|convergent sequences]] of [[rational number]]s.

Using this sequence, he constructs [[nested intervals]] whose [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] contains a real number not in the sequence. Since every sequence of real numbers can be used to construct a real not in the sequence, the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence \u2013 that is, the real numbers are not countable.  By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers, Cantor produces a transcendental number.

Call this set ''T''<sub>0</sub>. Then ''T''&nbsp;= ''T''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{''t<sub>n</sub>''}&nbsp;= ''T''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{''t''<sub>2''n''-1</sub>}&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{''t''<sub>2''n''</sub>}.

So both ''T'' and '''R''' are the union of three [[pairwise disjoint]] sets: ''T''<sub>0</sub> and two countable sets. A one-to-one correspondence between ''T'' and '''R''' is given by the function: ''f''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t'' if ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''T''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''(''t''<sub>2''n''-1</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t<sub>n</sub>'', and ''f''(''t''<sub>2''n''</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''. Cantor actually applies his construction to the irrationals rather than the transcendentals, but he knew that it applies to any set formed by removing countably many numbers from the set of reals ({{harvnb|Cantor|1879|p=4}}).</ref>\u000a\u000a[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage of Georg Cantor's article with his set definition]]\u000aBetween 1879 and 1884, Cantor published a series of six articles in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only if they could be constructed in a [[finitism|finite]] number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of [[actual infinity]] would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole.<ref name="popeleo">[[#Dauben1977|Dauben 1977]], p. 89.</ref> Cantor also introduced the [[Cantor set]] during this period.\u000a\u000aThe fifth paper in this series, "'''''Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre"''''' ("''Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates"''), published in 1883,<ref>{{harvnb|Cantor|1883}}.</ref> was the most important of the six and was also published as a separate [[monograph]]. It contained Cantor's reply to his critics and showed how the [[transfinite number]]s were a systematic extension of the natural numbers. It begins by defining [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal number]]s are then introduced as the order types of well-ordered sets. Cantor then defines the addition and multiplication of the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and ordinal numbers. In 1885, Cantor extended his theory of order types so that the ordinal numbers simply became a special case of order types.\u000a\u000aIn 1891, he published a paper containing his elegant "diagonal argument" for the existence of an uncountable set. He applied the same idea to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: the [[cardinality]] of the power set of a set ''A'' is strictly larger than the cardinality of ''A''. This established the richness of the hierarchy of infinite sets, and of the [[cardinal arithmetic|cardinal]] and [[ordinal arithmetic]] that Cantor had defined. His argument is fundamental in the solution of the [[Halting problem]] and the proof of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]]. Cantor wrote on the [[Goldbach conjecture]] in 1894.\u000a\u000aIn 1895 and 1897, Cantor published a two-part paper in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' under [[Felix Klein]]'s editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cantor|1895}}, {{harvtxt|Cantor|1897}}. The English translation is [[#Cantor1955|Cantor 1955]].</ref> The first paper begins by defining set, [[subset]], etc., in ways that would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of [[well-ordered set]]s and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if ''A'' and ''B'' are sets with ''A'' [[equinumerous|equivalent]] to a subset of ''B'' and ''B'' equivalent to a subset of ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' are equivalent. [[Ernst Schröder]] had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. [[Felix Bernstein (mathematician)|Felix Bernstein]] supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schröder theorem]].\u000a\u000a====One-to-one correspondence====\u000a{{Main|Bijection}}\u000a[[File:Bijection.svg|thumb|A bijective function.]]\u000aCantor's 1874 [[Crelle]] paper was the first to invoke the notion of a [[Bijection|1-to-1]] correspondence, though he did not use that phrase. He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the [[unit square]] and the points of a unit [[line segment]]. In an 1877 letter to [[Richard Dedekind]], Cantor proved a far [[Mathematical jargon#stronger|stronger]] result: for any positive integer ''n'', there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]]. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: "''Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas''!"

Cantor defined [[countable set]]s (or denumerable sets) as sets which can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the [[natural number]]s, and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable. He also proved that ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> has the same power as the [[real number]]s '''R''', as does a countably infinite [[Cartesian product|product]] of copies of '''R'''. While he made free use of countability as a concept, he did not write the word "countable" until 1883. Cantor also discussed his thinking about [[dimension]], stressing that his [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between the [[unit interval]] and the unit square was not a [[continuous function|continuous]] one.\u000a\u000aThis paper displeased Kronecker, and Cantor wanted to withdraw it; however, Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] supported its publication.<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], pp. 69, 324 ''63n.'' The paper had been submitted in July 1877. Dedekind supported it, but delayed its publication due to Kronecker's opposition. Weierstrass actively supported it.</ref> Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle.\u000a\u000a====Continuum hypothesis====\u000a{{Main|Continuum hypothesis}}\u000aCantor was the first to formulate what later came to be known as the [[continuum hypothesis]] or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is ''exactly'' aleph-one, rather than just ''at least'' aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to [[mathematical proof|prove]] it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.<ref name="daub280" />\u000a\u000aThe difficulty Cantor had in proving the continuum hypothesis has been underscored by later developments in the field of mathematics: a 1940 result by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] and a 1963 one by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] together imply that the continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved using standard [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] plus the [[axiom of choice]] (the combination referred to as "ZFC").<ref>Some mathematicians consider these results to have settled the issue, and, at most, allow that it is possible to examine the formal consequences of CH or of its negation, or of axioms that imply one of those. Others continue to look for "natural" or "plausible" axioms that, when added to ZFC, will permit either a proof or refutation of CH, or even for direct evidence for or against CH itself; among the most prominent of these is [[W. Hugh Woodin]]. One of Gödel's last papers argues that the CH is false, and the continuum has cardinality Aleph-2.</ref>\u000a\u000a====Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes====\u000aIn 1883, Cantor divided the infinite into the transfinite and the [[Absolute Infinite|absolute]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cantor|1883|pp=587\u2013588}}; English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996, pp. 916&ndash;917]].</ref> The transfinite is increasable in magnitude, while the absolute is unincreasable. For example, an ordinal \u03b1 is transfinite because it can be increased to \u03b1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. On the other hand, the ordinals form an absolutely infinite sequence that cannot be increased in magnitude because there are no larger ordinals to add to it.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986, pp. 41&ndash;42]].</ref> In 1883, Cantor also introduced the well-ordering principle "every set can be well-ordered" and stated that it is a "law of thought."<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982, p. 42]].</ref>\u000a\u000aCantor extended his work on the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an [[aleph number|aleph]].<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982, p. 51]]. Proof of equivalence: If a set is well-ordered, then its cardinality is an aleph since the alephs are the cardinals of well-ordered sets. If a set's cardinality is an aleph, then it can be well-ordered since there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the well-ordered set defining the aleph.</ref> First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986, pp. 166&ndash;169]].</ref> In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.<ref>Cantor's proof, which is a [[proof by contradiction]], starts by assuming there is a set ''S'' whose cardinality is not an aleph. A function from the ordinals to ''S'' is constructed by successively choosing different elements of ''S'' for each ordinal. If this construction runs out of elements, then the function well-orders the set ''S''. This implies that the cardinality of ''S'' is an aleph, contradicting the assumption about ''S''. Therefore, the function maps all the ordinals one-to-one into ''S''. The function's [[Image (mathematics)|image]] is an inconsistent submultiplicity contained in ''S'', so the set ''S'' is an inconsistent multiplicity, which is a contradiction. Zermelo criticized Cantor's construction: "the intuition of time is applied here to a process that goes beyond all intuition, and a fictitious entity is posited of which it is assumed that it could make ''successive'' arbitrary choices." ([[#Hallett|Hallett 1986, pp. 169&ndash;170]].)</ref>\u000a\u000aCantor avoided [[paradox]]es by recognizing that there are two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, [[Bertrand Russell]] treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is [[inconsistent]]. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (which was just mentioned), [[Cantor's paradox]], and [[Russell's paradox]].<ref>[[#Moore1988|Moore 1988, pp. 52&ndash;53]]; [[#Moore1981|Moore and Garciadiego 1981, p. 330]].</ref> Russell named paradoxes after [[Cesare Burali-Forti]] and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.<ref>[[#Moore1981|Moore and Garciadiego 1981, pp. 331, 343]]; [[#Purkert1989|Purkert 1989, p. 56]].</ref> \u000a\u000aIn 1908, Zermelo published [[Zermelo set theory|his axiom system for set theory]]. He had two motivations for developing the axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982, pp. 158&ndash;160]]. Moore argues that the latter was his primary motivation.</ref> Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the [[axiom of choice]], but his proof was criticized for a variety of reasons.<ref>Moore devotes a chapter to this criticism: "Zermelo and His Critics (1904&ndash;1908)", [[#Moore1982|Moore 1982, pp. 85&ndash;141]].</ref> His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.<ref>[[#Moore1982|Moore 1982, pp. 158&ndash;160]]. [[#Zermelo1908|Zermelo 1908, pp. 263&ndash;264]]; English translation: [[#Heijenoort|van Heijenoort 1967, p. 202]].</ref> \u000a\u000aIn 1923, [[John von Neumann]] developed an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes by using an approach similar to Cantor's\u2014namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a [[Class (set theory)|class]] is too big to be a set if it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986, pp. 288, 290&ndash;291]]. Cantor had pointed out that inconsistent multiplicities face the same restriction: they cannot be members of any multiplicity. ([[#Hallett|Hallett 1986, p. 286]].)</ref> Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem.<ref>[[#Hallett|Hallett 1986, pp. 291&ndash;292]].</ref> In 1930, Zermelo defined [[Zermelo's models and the axiom of limitation of size|models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom]].<ref>[[#Zermelo1930|Zermelo 1930]]; English translation: [[#Ewald|Ewald 1996, pp. 1208&ndash;1233]].</ref>\u000a\u000a==Philosophy, religion and Cantor's mathematics==\u000aThe concept of the existence of an [[actual infinity]] was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion.

For constructivists such as Kronecker, this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that [[nonconstructive proof]]s such as Cantor's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists, holding instead that [[constructive proof]]s are required. Intuitionism also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality, but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism. Firstly, Cantor's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity, whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions, originating instead in the intuitions of the mind.<ref name="daub266"/> Secondly, the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism, since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set.<ref>{{Citation |surname=Snapper|given=Ernst |year=1979|url=<!-- http://math.boisestate.edu/~tconklin/MATH547/Main/Exhibits/Three%20Crises%20in%20Math%20A.pdf -->http://www2.gsu.edu/~matgtc/three%20crises%20in%20mathematics.pdf |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism and Formalism|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=524|pages=207\u2013216}}</ref> Mathematicians such as [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and especially [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] adopted an [[Intuitionism|intuitionist]] stance against Cantor's work.

However, there is a letter from Cantor's brother Louis to their mother, stating:\u000a{{quote|Mögen wir zehnmal von Juden abstammen und ich im Princip noch so sehr für Gleichberechtigung der Hebräer sein, im socialen Leben sind mir Christen lieber ...<ref name="pi87"/>}}\u000a\u000a("Even if we were descended from Jews ten times over, and even though I may be, in principle, completely in favour of equal rights for Hebrews, in social life I prefer Christians...") which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry.<ref>For more information, see: [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 1 and notes; [[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], pp. 350\u2013352 and notes; [[#Purkert|Purkert and Ilgauds 1985]]; the letter is from {{harvnb|Aczel|2000|pp=93\u201394}}, from Louis' trip to Chicago in 1863. It is ambiguous in German, as in English, whether the recipient is included.</ref>\u000a\u000aThere were documented statements, during the 1930s, that called this Jewish ancestry into question:\u000a{{quote|More often [i.e., than the ancestry of the mother] the question has been discussed of whether Georg Cantor was of Jewish origin. About this it is reported in a notice of the Danish genealogical Institute in Copenhagen from the year 1937 concerning his father: "It is hereby testified that Georg Woldemar Cantor, born 1809 or 1814, is not present in the registers of the Jewish community, and that he completely without doubt was not a Jew&nbsp;..."<ref name="pi87"/>}}\u000a\u000aIt is also later said in the same document:\u000a{{quote|Also efforts for a long time by the librarian Josef Fischer, one of the best experts on Jewish genealogy in Denmark, charged with identifying Jewish professors, that Georg Cantor was of Jewish descent, finished without result. [Something seems to be wrong with this sentence, but the meaning seems clear enough.] In Cantor's published works and also in his Nachlass there are no statements by himself which relate to a Jewish origin of his ancestors. There is to be sure in the Nachlass a copy of a letter of his brother Ludwig from 18 November 1869 to their mother with some unpleasant antisemitic statements, in which it is said among other things:&nbsp;...<ref name="pi87"/>}}(the rest of the quote is finished by the very first quote above). In Men of Mathematics, Eric Temple Bell described Cantor as being "of pure Jewish descent on both sides," although both parents were baptized.  In a 1971 article entitled "Towards a Biography of Georg Cantor," the British historian of mathematics Ivor Grattan-Guinness mentions ([[Annals of Science]] 27, pp.&nbsp;345\u2013391, 1971) that he was unable to find evidence of Jewish ancestry. (He also states that Cantor's wife, Vally Guttmann, was Jewish).\u000a\u000aIn a letter written by Georg Cantor to [[Paul Tannery]] in 1896 (Paul Tannery, Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondence, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1934, p.&nbsp;306), Cantor states that his paternal grandparents were members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Copenhagen.  Specifically, Cantor states in describing his father: "Er ist aber in Kopenhagen geboren, von israelitischen Eltern, die der dortigen portugisischen Judengemeinde..."  ("He was born in Copenhagen of Jewish (lit: "Israelite") parents from the local Portuguese-Jewish community.")<ref>Tannery, Paul (1934) ''Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondance'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 306.</ref>\u000a\u000aIn addition, Cantor's maternal great uncle,<ref>[[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 274.</ref> a Hungarian violinist [[Josef Böhm]], has been described as Jewish,<ref>Mendelsohn, Ezra (ed.) (1993) [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11440061?versionId=13425381 ''Modern Jews and their musical agendas''], Oxford University Press, p. 9.</ref> which may imply that Cantor's mother was at least partly descended from the Hungarian Jewish community.<ref>''Ismerjük''oket?: zsidó származású nevezetes magyarok arcképcsarnoka'', István Reményi Gyenes Ex Libris, (Budapest 1997), pages 132\u2013133</ref>\u000a\u000aIn a letter to Bertrand Russell, Cantor described his ancestry and self-perception as follows:\u000a{{quote|Neither my father nor my mother were of German blood, the first being a Dane, borne in Kopenhagen, my mother of Austrian Hungar descension. You must know, Sir, that I am not a ''regular just Germain'', for I am born 3 March 1845 at Saint Peterborough, Capital of Russia, but I went with my father and mother and brothers and sister, eleven years old in the year 1856, into Germany.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography'', vol. I, p. 229. In English in the original; italics also as in the original.</ref>}}\u000a\u000a==Historiography==\u000aUntil the 1970s, the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] (1927) \u2013 largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler \u2013 and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at second and third hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by [[Eric Temple Bell]]'s ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as "perhaps the most widely read modern book on the [[history of mathematics]]"; and as "one of the worst".<ref>[[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]], p. 350.</ref> Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as Oedipal, Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics, and fills the picture with stereotypes. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell \u2013 including one that labels Cantor's father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents.<ref>[[#Guinness1971|Grattan-Guinness 1971]] (quotation from p. 350, note), [[#Dauben1979|Dauben 1979]], p. 1 and notes. (Bell's Jewish stereotypes appear to have been removed from some postwar editions.)</ref> A critique of Bell's book is contained in [[Joseph Dauben]]'s biography.<ref>[[#Dauben79|Dauben 1979]]</ref> Writes Dauben:\u000a:Cantor devoted some of his most vituperative correspondence, as well as a portion of the ''Beiträge'', to attacking what he described at one point as the '[[infinitesimal]] Cholera bacillus of mathematics', which had spread from Germany through the work of [[Carl Johannes Thomae|Thomae]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois Reymond]] and [[Otto Stolz|Stolz]], to infect Italian mathematics ... Any acceptance of infinitesimals necessarily meant that his own theory of number was incomplete. Thus to accept the work of Thomae, du Bois-Reymond, Stolz and [[Giuseppe Veronese|Veronese]] was to deny the perfection of Cantor's own creation. Understandably, Cantor launched a thorough campaign to discredit Veronese's work in every way possible.<ref>Dauben, J.: The development of the Cantorian set theory, pp.~181\u2013219.
