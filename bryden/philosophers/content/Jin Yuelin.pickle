He was also a commentator on Bertrand Russell.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aJin was born in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] and attended [[Tsinghua University]] from 1911 until 1914. He obtained Ph.D. in Political Science from [[Columbia University]] in 1920. In 1926, Jin founded the Department of Philosophy at Tsinghua University. Jin was an active participant in the [[May 4th movement]] as a young, intellectual revolutionary. He helped to incorporate the scientific method into philosophy.<ref>Schwarcz, Vera. The Chinese Enlightenment: Intellectuals and the Legacy of the May Fourth Movement of 1919. Berkeley: University of California, 1985. Print. p.xii, 99</ref> Hao Wang was one of his undergraduate students.\u000a\u000aHe died in [[Beijing]].\u000a\u000a== Philosophical context: Eastern vs. Western thought==\u000aAmong the first to introduce certain basics of modern logic into China,<ref>His ''Logic'' of 1936 shows Jin more adept with philosophical than with technical aspects of logic.  This is confirmed by remarks of Hao Wang in 'Memories related to Professor Jin Yuelin,' trans. Montgomery Link and Richard Jandovitz, in Charles Parsons and Montgomery Link (eds.), ''Hao Wang, Logician and Philosopher,''  (London: College Publications, 2011), pp, 27\u201338.  Original article published in 1982 in ''Wide Angle Monthly,'' No. 122, 61-63.</ref>  Jin also founded a new philosophical system combining elements from Western and Chinese philosophical traditions (especially the concept of [[Tao]]). Not much work on Jin\u2019s philosophy has been done in the West in English, although a decent amount has been done in Chinese.<ref>Zinda, Yvonne Schulz. Jin Yuelin's Ontology. Leiden: Brill, 2012. Print p.11</ref>  Jin does not advocate a traditional, historical approach to philosophy, but rather presents philosophy as a practicing approach to solving problems \u2013 philosophy as goal in and of itself.<ref>Zinda, 2012, p.5</ref>  This is quite different from how Chinese philosophers at the time viewed the study of philosophy.  At the risk of oversimplifying, Jin\u2019s approach can be viewed as a hybrid between Western and Eastern philosophical ideologies \u2013 influenced both by his Western education in [[logic]] and science, and by his Chinese roots. He was particularly interested in [[Bertrand Russell]]\u2019s work, which is based partly upon [[New realism (philosophy)|New Realism]] in British Philosophy.  Russell worked with two main concepts: breaking down the complex into smaller parts, and rebuilding the logic method, both of which affected Jin\u2019s thinking and philosophy.<ref>Schwarcz, Vera. Time for Telling Truth Is Running Out: Conversations with Zhang Shenfu. New Haven: Yale UP, 1992. Print. p.139</ref>  However Jin can be considered a Chinese philosopher because he was most informed by Chinese philosophy, and concerned himself most with Chinese concepts, such as Tao.<ref>Ma, Lin. Rev. of Dao and Truth: A Study of Jin Yuelin's Philosophy, by Hu Jun. Dao: A Journal of Comparative Philosophy: 177-80. Print.</ref>  \u201cHowever,\u201d Zinda writes, \u201cJin used discursive structures borrowed from both Chinese and Western thought as modes of persuasion\u201d.<ref>Zinda, 2012, p.179</ref>\u000a\u000a===Jin's views on Chinese philosophy===\u000a\u000aJin\u2019s writing is intertwined with his desire to navigate the space between Chinese and Western philosophy.  In his essay \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d, Jin highlights the differences he sees between the two spheres regarding the study of philosophy.  He sees the Western approach to philosophy as being more of a meticulous scientific and logical approach that he traces back to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic thought in Ancient Greece]].<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Chinese Philosophy." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 531-50. Print. p.536</ref>  In contrast, he explains Chinese philosophy as having \u201cunderdevelopment of what might be called logico-epistemological consciousness\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Chinese Philosophy." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 531-50. Print. p.533</ref>  He explains Chinese philosophy as being more poetic in that it has \u201cbareness and disconnectedness\u201d,<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Chinese Philosophy." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 531-50. Print. p.534</ref> where Western philosophy is more verbose.  This lack of extended explanation in Chinese philosophy leads, Jin notes, to Chinese philosophy being more about interpreting old philosopher\u2019s work, rather than presenting new original ways of thinking.  In contrast, Jin does not attribute ideas to past thinkers or quote past thinkers in his own philosophy.<ref>Zinda, 2012, p.29</ref>  Additionally, he did not pursue the [[Nationalist Chinese|nationalistic]] aims of China in his philosophy, as many of his colleagues did.<ref>Zinda, 2012, p.181</ref>  Jin notes that China has a long history of the study of philosophy and political science being intertwined; the philosophy of today is a more specialized and differentiated discipline.  This detachment from the discipline, while it creates objective knowledge, distances the philosopher from the philosophy.  Jin advocates for living philosophy, rather than just knowing it.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Chinese Philosophy." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 531-50. Print. p.547</ref>  Thus, he works to take advantage of the emotional attachment of Chinese words.  For example, Jin chooses not to translate the word \u201c[[Daoism|Dao]]\u201d to English, but keeps its Chinese origin.<ref>Zinda, 2012, 31</ref>\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a*1936: ''Logic'' (\u300a\u903b\u8f91\u300b/\u300a\u908f\u8f2f\u300b)\u000a*1940: ''On Tao'' (\u300a\u8bba\u9053\u300b/\u300a\u8ad6\u9053\u300b)\u000a*1965: ''Criticism of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s Philosophy'' (\u300a\u7f57\u7d20\u54f2\u5b66\u6279\u5224\u300b/\u300a\u7f85\u7d20\u54f2\u5b78\u6279\u5224\u300b)\u000a*1983: ''A Theory of Knowledge'' (\u300a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bba\u300b/\u300a\u77e5\u8b58\u8ad6\u300b)\u000a\u000a===Basic  writings and concepts===\u000a\u000aJin\u2019s most accomplished philosophical writings are his three principal publications written in Chinese: Logic (1935), On Tao (1940), and A Theory of Knowledge (1983).  His English publication, "Tao, Nature, and Man" draws heavily on thought from "On Dao", which he considers to be one of the most central parts of his philosophical work.<ref>Hu, Jun. "On Jin Yuelin's Metaphysics." Department of Philosophy, Peking University. Web. <http://www.phil.pku.edu.cn/zxm/pdf/spec05.pdf>. p.2</ref>  Jin\u2019s metaphysics is focused mostly on Tao, which he argues is what life is made up of.  It is composed of two main elements that Jin coins as Stuff and Form.  In short, Stuff refers to the inexpressible matter that fills everything, while Form refers to all of reality that is being filled.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.604-610</ref>  Essentially, Tao is the result of when Form is filled with Stuff.<ref>Hu, p.3</ref>  Jin uses his definition of Tao to posit a universal sympathy: everything \u2013 including humans \u2013 is one in the same, and we should appreciate life as such.\u000a\u000a====Stuff====\u000a\u000aStuff is inexpressible.  In fact, the word \u201cStuff\u201d itself is simply a word Jin uses to approximate the definition because, he posits, no word or human will ever fully grasp the concept.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.604-610</ref> Scholar Hu Jun writes, \u201cWhat is required in order to grasp matter [Stuff] is a sort of intellectual projection, in which recognition of the limits of one\u2019s intellect is accompanied by a leave out of the intellectual process...\u201d.<ref>Hu, p.2</ref>  Stuff refers to the capacity of all things to change \u2013 pure activity and potentiality.  It is composed of two categories \u2013 Universals and Possibilities.\u000a\u000a====Universals and possibilities====\u000a\u000aJin explains the notions of Universals and Possibilities as stemming from the ideal version of concepts, which in turn stems from [[Abstraction|abstracting]] the concrete.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.604-610</ref>  The Universal refers to a concept which a group of things have in common.  Jin writes, \u201cEach universal is an aspect shared by a class of objects, for example\u2026 horseness which is shared by a class of quadrupeds\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.606</ref>  Universals are groupings that we are familiar with.  A Possibility, therefore, is a concept that is not a Universal.  It is that which has not been imagined yet, but could be imagined.   Thus, Jin writes, \u201cwe are able to define an universal as a realized possibility\u2026 A universal is merely a Stuffed possibility\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.607-608</ref>  Jin posits that the reality we feel with regard to events and objects is the realization of possibilities of those events and objects.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.608</ref>  Hu writes, \u201cThe realization of contingent possibilities gives us the richness, variety, and completeness of Tao, whereas the eternally unrealized possibilities supply us with the implements in the realm of thinking and thought\u201d.<ref>Hu, p.4</ref>\u000a\u000a====Form====\u000a\u000aForm is what Stuff must remain inside of.  Hu writes, \u201cWhether or not matter [Stuff] enters into or withdraws from possibilities, it must stay within Form\u201d.<ref>Hu, p.3</ref>  Everything is inside of Form.  Jin explains that unlike Universals, it does not have \u201ca boundary line dividing what belongs to it from what doesn\u2019t\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.611</ref>  Thus Form is formless \u2013 it incorporates everything and is nothing at the same time.  It is what is left when there are no possibilities \u2013 there is nothing outside of Form.<ref>Ma, Lin. Rev. of Dao and Truth: A Study of Jin Yuelin's Philosophy, by Hu Jun. Dao: A Journal of Comparative Philosophy: 177-80. Print.</ref>  Form and Stuff are inescapably intertwined. Stuff fills Form, and Form contains Stuff.  Jin writes, \u201cUn-Stuffed Form or Un-formed Stuff is a contradiction\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.619</ref> Jin defines their relationship as, \u201cStuff as a sort of raw material and Form as a kind of mould\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.617</ref>\u000a\u000a====Tao====\u000a\u000aTao is Jin\u2019s most basic concept, but is also his highest ideal realm.<ref>Hu, p.6</ref>  Tao is the coming together of Stuff and Form to create the universe.   If Tao were only Stuff then it would be fluid, and if it were only Form then it would be empty.  Jin writes, \u201cTao is simply Stuffed Form or Formed Stuff.  It is therefore neither pure Form nor pure Stuff\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.624</ref>  Tao is all-pervasive and incorporates everything.  Therefore, Jin posits that humans are part of Tao, and urges us to be \u201cconscious of the fundamental oneness at which we are with the universe and everything there is in it\u201d.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750. Print. p.637</ref> He presents a [[universe]] where everything has the same status because everything is made up of the same fabric.  Scholar Yvonne Schulz Zinda writes, \u201che established a kind of ontological certainty that integrates individuals the evolutionary process of  dao, through which they are interrelated with each other\u201d.<ref>Zinda, Yvonne Schulz. Jin Yuelin's Ontology. Leiden: Brill, 2012. Print. p.178</ref> While different things have different jobs \u2013 Jin gives the example of a mosquito\u2019s job being to bite a human, and a human\u2019s job to kill the mosquito \u2013 one thing not innately superior to the other.<ref>Jin, Yuelin. "Tao, Nature and Man." Collected Writings of Jin Yuelin. Vol. 2. Gansu People's, 1995. 568-750.
