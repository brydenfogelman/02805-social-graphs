Her thesis was on the concept of mixture in quantum mechanics. Before taking her current appointments, she taught at the [[University of Maryland]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[London School of Economics]]. She has held visiting appointments at the [[University of Oslo]], [[Princeton University]], [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[UCLA]]. She is currently Tsing Hua Honorary Distinguished Chair Professor at the [[National Tsing Hua University]] in Taiwan and Visiting Research Fellow at [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|Ca' Foscari]] University in Venice. She co-founded the [[Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science]] (CPNSS) at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] and the [[Centre for Humanities Engaging Science and Society]] (CHESS) at the [[University of Durham]].\u000a\u000aCartwright has mentored several students in England and the United States who have gone on to become professional philosophers of science, including [[Naomi Oreskes]], Carl Hoefer, [[Mauricio Suarez]], Andrew Hamilton, Julian Reiss, Roman Frigg, Gabriele Contessa, Anna Alexandrova, Leah McClimans, Jacob Stegenga, Jeremy Howick, Marta Halina, Joyce Havstad, Sindhuja Bhakthavatsalam, Peter Menzies, Martin Thomson-Jones, Matt Brown, [[Hasok Chang]], Jordi Cat, Sophia Efstathiou, Sang Wook Yi, Towfic Shomar and Szu-Ting Chen.  She was also a supervisor of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]].\u000a\u000aCartwright was married to the philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]] until his death in 2004. She was also previously married to [[Ian Hacking]]. She has two daughters, Emily and Sophie Hampshire Cartwright, and a granddaughter, Lucy Charlton.\u000a\u000a== Main contributions ==\u000a\u000aCartwright's approach to the [[philosophy of science]] is associated with the "[[Stanford School]]" of [[Patrick Suppes]], [[John Dupré]], [[Peter Galison]] and [[Ian Hacking]]. It is characterized by an emphasis on scientific practice as opposed to abstract scientific theories. Cartwright has made important contributions to debates on laws of nature, causation and causal inference, scientific models in the natural and social sciences, objectivity and the unity of science. Her recent work focuses on evidence and its use in informing policy decisions.\u000a\u000aCarl Hoefer describes Cartwright's philosophy in the following terms:<ref>Hartmann, Stephann, Hoefer, Carl and Luc Bovens (eds.) - Nancy Cartwright's Philosophy of Science. London: Routledge. 2008. p. 14.</ref>\u000a<blockquote>\u000aNancy Cartwright\u2019s philosophy of science is, in her view, a form of empiricism but empiricism in the style of Neurath and Mill, rather than of Hume or Carnap. Her concerns are not with the problems of skepticism, induction, or demarcation; she is concerned with how actual science achieves the successes it does, and what sort of metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions are needed to understand that success.\u000a\u000aCartwright, like many working scientists themselves, takes a rather pragmatic/realist stance toward observations and interventions made by scientists and engineers and particularly toward their connections to causality: Scientists see impurities causing signal loss in a cable, and they stimulate an inverted population, causing it to lase. Given these starting points, there can be no question of a skeptical attitude toward causation, in either singular or generic form. The fundamental role (or better, roles) played by causation in scientific practice is undeniable; what Cartwright does, then, is reconfigure empiricism from the ground up based on this insight. In the reconfiguration process, many mainstays of the received view of science take a beating; especially [...] the fundamentality of laws of nature.\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a== Honors and awards ==\u000a\u000aCartwright served as the president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] (2009\u201310)<ref name=philsci-gov /> and as vice-president (2007\u20138) and president (2008\u20139) of the Pacific Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]].<ref name = apa-gov /> She is Professor Emeritus at the [[London School of Economics]]. She is also Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. She has received honorary degrees from [[Southern Methodist University]] and the [[University of St Andrews]] as well as a [[MacArthur Fellowship]].
