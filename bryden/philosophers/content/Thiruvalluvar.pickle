His wife's name is  Vaasuki.\u000aThere are lots of legends about the pair Thiruvalluvar and Vaasuki. Two of them are: 1) Once Vaasuki Ammaiyar was drawing water from well and Thiruvalluvar called her and she left the water and ran in immediately, but the water pot stayed in mid air. Such was her austerity and dedication towards her husband Thiruvalluvar; 2) Thiruvalluvar used to sit every day for meal with a cup of water and a wooden tooth pick. He did this to pick any grain of rice spilled out from his leaf when Vaasuki Ammaiyar served food. It was said that Thiruvalluvar could not even pick a grain of rice every day. Such was the dedication in serving meal by Vaasuki Ammaiyar.\u000aThiruvalluvar may have spent part of his life in Madurai because it was under the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiya]] rulers that many Tamil poets flourished. There is also the recent claim by [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu in the hilly tracts of the [[Kanyakumari District]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite news\u000a | title =Valluvar lived in Kanyakumari district\u000a | publisher=Yahoo!
