Bell died, aged 83, in London.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000a\u000a===Origins===\u000aBell was born in [[East Shefford]], Berkshire, in 1881, the third of four children of William Heward Bell (1849\u20131927) and Hannah Taylor Cory (1850\u20131942). He had an elder brother ([[William Cory Heward Bell|Cory]]), an elder sister (Lorna, Mrs Acton), and a younger sister (Dorothy, Mrs Hony). His father was a civil engineer who built his fortune in the family coal mines in [[Wiltshire]] in England and [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales - "a family which drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it on the destruction of wild animals".<ref>Bell, Quentin ''Bloomsbury'', London: Futura 1974, p. 19</ref> They lived at Cleve House in [[Seend]], near [[Devizes]], Wiltshire, which was adorned with Squire Bell's many hunting trophies.\u000a\u000a===Marriage and other relationships===\u000aHe was educated at [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{acad|id=BL899AC|name=Bell <nowiki>[post Clive-Bell]</nowiki>, Arthur Clive Heward}}</ref> where he studied history.  In 1902 he received an Earl of Derby scholarship to study in Paris, where his interest in art originated. Upon his return to England, he moved to London, where he met and married artist [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa Stephen]], sister of [[Virginia Woolf]], early in 1907.<ref>[http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Virginia_Woolf_Biography_And_Visits.htm Virginia Woolf biography and visits], infobritain.co.uk; accessed 2 October 2014.</ref><ref name=yomCB>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=Myg8XQLso2%2FEgA9%2FcYHFzA&scan=1|title=Index entry: Bell Arthur Clive H.| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837-1983|publisher=ONS}}</ref><ref name=yomVS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=fuHZxw%2F0iO%2BQ1Jtk%2BoF00A&scan=1| title=Index entry: Stephen Vanessa| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837-1983| publisher=ONS}}</ref>\u000a\u000aBy [[World War I]] their marriage was over. Vanessa had begun a lifelong relationship with [[Duncan Grant]] and Clive had a number of liaisons with other women such as Mary Hutchinson.  However, Clive and Vanessa never officially separated or divorced. Not only did they keep visiting each other regularly, they also sometimes spent holidays together and paid "family" visits to Clive's parents. Clive lived in London but often spent long stretches of time at the farmhouse of [[Charleston, Sussex|Charleston]], where Vanessa lived with Duncan and her three children by Clive and Duncan. He fully supported her wish to have a child by Duncan and allowed this daughter, Angelica, to bear his surname. Clive and Vanessa had two sons ([[Julian Bell|Julian]] and [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]]), who both became writers. Julian joined the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as an ambulance driver. He was killed in 1937 by an enemy shell, aged 29.<ref>Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 697</ref>\u000a\u000aVanessa's daughter by Duncan, [[Angelica Garnett]] (née Bell), was raised as Clive's daughter until she married. She was informed, by her mother Vanessa, just prior to her marriage and shortly after her brother Julian's death, that in fact Duncan Grant was her biological father.<ref>Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 698. This deception forms the central message of her memoir, ''Deceived with Kindness'' (1984).</ref>\u000a   \u000aAccording to historian Stanley Rosenbaum, "Bell may, indeed, be the least liked member of Bloomsbury. Bell has been found wanting by biographers and critics of the Group \u2013 as a husband, a father, and especially a brother-in-law. It is undeniable that he was a wealthy snob, hedonist, and womaniser, a racist and an anti-Semite (but not a homophobe), who changed from a liberal socialist and pacifist into a reactionary appeaser. Bell's reputation has led to his being underestimated in the history of Bloomsbury."<ref>Rosenbaum, S.P. ''Georgian Bloomsbury: The early literary history of the Bloomsbury Group, 1910\u20131914''. New York: Palgrave. 2003, p. 37<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\u000a\u000a==Political views==\u000aBell was at one point an adherent of absolute pacifism, and during the [[First World War]] was a [[conscientious objector]], allowed to perform Work of National Importance by assisting on the farm of [[Philip Morrell]]. [[Melting point|MP]], at Garsington Manor. In his 1938 pamphlet ''War Mongers'', he opposed any attempt by Britain to use military force, arguing "the worst tyranny is better than the best war".<ref>Susan Sellers, ''The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf'' Cambridge University Press, 2010; ISBN 0521896940, (p. 23).</ref><ref name="lj">Lawrence James, ''Warrior Race: A History of the British at War'', Hachette UK, 2010; ISBN 0748125353 (p. 620).</ref> However, by 1940 Bell was a supporter of the British war effort, calling for a "ceaseless war against Hitler".<ref name="lj"/>\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a*''Art'' (1914)\u000a*''Pot-boilers'' (1918)\u000a*''Since Cézanne'' (1922)\u000a*''Civilization'' (1928)\u000a*''Proust'' (1929)\u000a*''An Account of French Painting'' (1931)\u000a*''Old Friends'' (1956)\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Reflist|30em}}\u000a\u000a==Sources==\u000a* {{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Clive|title=Art|date=2015|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781514244715|orig-year=1914}}\u000a* {{cite book|last1=Bywater|first1=William G|title=Clive Bell's Eye|date=1975|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780814315347}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a* [http://www.charleston.org.uk/ Charleston Farmhouse]\u000a* {{Gutenberg author |id=Bell,+Clive | name=Clive Bell}}\u000a* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Clive Bell |sopt=t}}\u000a\u000a{{aesthetics}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Bell, Clive}}\u000a[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]]\u000a[[Category:British conscientious objectors]]\u000a[[Category:English art critics]]\u000a[[Category:Bloomsbury Group]]\u000a[[Category:Philosophers of art]]\u000a[[Category:People from Wiltshire]]\u000a[[Category:Disease-related deaths in England]]\u000a[[Category:Writers from London]]\u000a[[Category:1881 births]]\u000a[[Category:1964 deaths]]
