V'''Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld''' (8 August 1879, [[Oakland, California]]{{spaced ndash}}21 October 1918, [[Alameda, California]])<ref>The [[Yale Law Journal]]. Vol. 28, No. 2, Dec., 1918, page 167: [http://www.jstor.org/stable/786851?seq=2 "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld"].</ref> was an American [[jurist]]. He was the author of the seminal ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays'' (1919).\u000a\u000aDuring his life he published only a handful of law journal articles. After his death the material forming the basis of ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions'' was derived from two articles in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' (1913) and (1917) that had been partially revised with a view to publication. Editorial work was undertaken to complete the revisions and the book was published with the inclusion of the manuscript notes that Hohfeld had left, plus seven other essays.\u000a\u000aThe work remains a powerful contribution to modern understanding of the nature of [[rights]] and the implications of [[liberty]]. To reflect Hohfeld's continuing importance, a chair at [[Yale University]] is named after him.  The chair is unoccupied as of 2016 but was last held by [[Jules Coleman]], who retired in 2012.\u000a\u000a==Career==\u000aWesley Newcomb Hohfeld was born in California in 1879.  He graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1901.  He went on to [[Harvard Law School]], where he served as editor of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', and graduated in 1904 with honors.\u000a\u000aFrom 1905 to 1913 Hohfeld taught at [[Stanford Law School]].  He then moved to [[Yale Law School]], where he taught until his death in 1918.<ref>Dictionary of American Biography 5:124 (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1933); Guide to American Law 6:58 (St. Paul, West Publishing 1984); ''see also'' Hohfeld's obituary, "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld", 28 Yale Law Journal 166 (1918) and Walter W.

Hohfeld's contribution was to simplify; he created a very precise analysis which distinguished between fundamental legal concepts and then identified the framework of relationships between them. His work offers a sophisticated method for deconstructing broad legal principles into their component elements.  By showing how legal relationships are connected to each other, the resulting analysis illuminates policy implications and identifies the issues which arise in practical decision making.<ref>Luca Fiorito and Massimiliano Vatiero (2011), "Beyond Legal Relations: Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld's Influence on American Institutionalism".

He wrote that such imprecision of language indicated a concomitant imprecision of thought, and thus also of the resulting legal conclusions. In order to both facilitate reasoning and clarify rulings, he attempted to disambiguate the term ''rights'' by breaking it into eight distinct concepts. To eliminate ambiguity, he defined these terms relative to one another, grouping them into four pairs of Jural Opposites and four pairs of Jural Correlatives.\u000a\u000a{|align="center" width="485px" style="font-size:115%; line-height:105%; background:transparent;"\u000a|-\u000a|align="left" valign="center" width="175px"|&nbsp;\u000a|&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" valign="center" width="75px"|(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" valign="center" width="75px"|(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" valign="center" width="75px"|(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" valign="center" width="75px"|(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|-\u000a|align="left" valign="center" width="175px"|JURAL OPPOSITES\u000a|align="left" width="5px"|[[File:GullBraceLeft.svg|right|9px]]\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="75px"|Right<br/>No-right\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="75px"|Privilege<br/>Duty\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="75px"|Power<br/>Disability\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="75px"|Immunity<br/>Liability\u000a|}\u000a\u000a{|align="center" width="485px" style="font-size:115%; line-height:105%; background:transparent;"\u000a|-\u000a|align="left" width="220px"|&nbsp;\u000a|&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" width="70px"|(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" width="70px"|(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" width="70px"|(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|align="center" width="70px"|(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u000a|-\u000a|align="left" valign="center" width="220px"|JURAL CORRELATIVES\u000a|align="left" width="5px"|[[File:GullBraceLeft.svg|right|9px]]\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="70px"|Right<br/>Duty\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="70px"|Privilege<br/>No-right\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="70px"|Power<br/>Liability\u000a|align="left" valign="top" width="70px"|Immunity<br/>Disability\u000a|}\u000a\u000aThis use of the words ''right'' and ''privilege'' correspond respectively to the concepts of [[claim rights and liberty rights]].\u000a\u000aHohfeld argued that right and duty are correlative concepts, i.e. the one must always be matched by the other. If A has a right against B, this is equivalent to B having a duty to honor A's right. If B has no duty, that means that B has a privilege, i.e. B can do whatever he or she pleases because B has no duty to refrain from doing it, and A has no right to prohibit B from doing so. Each individual is located within a matrix of relationships with other individuals. By summing the rights held and duties owed across all these relationships, the analyst can identify both the degree of liberty \u2014 an individual would be considered to have perfect liberty if it is shown that no one has a right to prevent the given act \u2014 and whether the concept of liberty is comprised by commonly followed practices, thereby establishing general moral principles and [[civil rights]].\u000a\u000a===Examples of Hohfeldian analysis===\u000aHohfeld defines the correlatives in terms of the relationships between two individuals. In the theory of "in rem rights", there is a direct relationship between a person and a thing. Real rights are in this respect unlike claim rights or "rights in personam", which by nature must be exercised against a person, the best example being when someone is owed money by another. Hohfeld demonstrates that this way of understanding rights in general is wrong. In particular, Hohfeld demonstrates that there is no such thing as a legal relation between a person and a thing, since a legal relation always operates between two people. As the legal relations between any two people are complex, it is helpful to break them down into their simplest forms. Legal rights do not correspond to single Hohfeldian relations, but are compounds of them. A right can be defined as an aggregate of the Hohfeldian relations with other people.\u000a\u000aHohfeld replaces the concept of \u201cright in personam\u201d by \u201cpaucital right\u201d and "right in rem" by a compound or aggregate of "multital rights". Rights held by a person against one or a few definite persons are paucital (or \u201cin personam\u201d), and rights held by a person against a large indefinite class of people are multital (or \u201cin rem\u201d). A contract right is paucital (or "in personam") because it can be enforced only against the specific parties to the contract. A property right is multital (or "in rem") because a landowner has the right to exclude not only specific people from his land but the "whole world". The landowner has many rights, privileges, powers, and immunities; his multital rights are composed of many paucital rights. For example, the owner has a right that others do not step on his land but there is not just one such right against a mass of persons (the community), but many separate although usually identical paucital rights with this content (as many instances as there are people in the community). This is what Hohfeld calls "multital\u201d rights.\u000a\u000aConsider also the definition of liberty. In Hohfeldian analysis, liberty is defined by an absence both of a duty and of a right. B is free because he has no obligation to recognize any of A's rights. That does not deny that B might decide to do what A wants because that is the essence of liberty. Nor does it deny the possibility that B might accept a duty to A to give a benefit to C. In that situation, C would have no right and would have to rely on A to enforce the duty. The truth is that liberty is significant from both a legal and a moral point of view because only liberty ensures that an individual has control over his or her choices on whether and how to act. If something interferes with this choice, the natural reaction is to resent it and to seek a remedy. The corelative between right and duty inevitably describes the way in which two people are limited in their choices to act, and the outside observer cannot capture the legal and moral implications without examining the nature of the right held by A. Hence, this relationship is qualitatively different. An interference with liberty would be considered wrongful without having to ask for detailed evidence. Yet whether A's relationship with B is morally suspect could only be determined by evaluating evidence on precisely what B's duty requires B to do or not to do.\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[Civil rights]]\u000a*[[Claim rights and liberty rights]]\u000a*[[Private property]]\u000a*[[Property]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{More footnotes|date=November 2008}}\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==Further reading==\u000a* American Law Institute.
