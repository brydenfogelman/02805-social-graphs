The name ''Hammurabi'' derives from the [[Amorite language|Amorite]] term ''\u02bbAmmur\u0101pi'' ("the kinsman is a healer"), itself from ''\u02bbAmmu'' ("paternal kinsman") and ''R\u0101pi'' ("healer").\u000a\u000a== Reign and conquests ==\u000a[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in c. 1792 BC and upon his death in c. 1750 BC]]\u000a[[File:Royal portrait - Hamurabi - King of Babylon -1900 before JC -.JPG|thumb|left|upright|This bust, known as the "Head of Hammurabi", is now thought to predate Hammurabi by a few hundred years<ref>http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/royal-head-known-head-hammurabi</ref> (''[[Louvre]]'')]]\u000aHammurabi was an [[Amorite]] [[First Babylonian Dynasty|First Dynasty]] king of the [[city-state]] of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], in c. 1792 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}</ref> Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi.<ref name="VM3">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}</ref> The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding. However his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]].<ref name="VM3" />\u000a\u000aThus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation. The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta.  To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]] which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia.  In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThe first few decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful.

The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, [[Susa]]; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in [[Iran]] and is now in the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]]. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by [[scribe]]s on 12 tablets.

The punishments tended to be very harsh by modern standards, with many offenses resulting in death, disfigurement, or the use of the "[[Eye for an Eye|Eye for eye, tooth for tooth]]" ([[An eye for an eye|Lex Talionis]] "Law of Retaliation") philosophy.<ref>"Review: The Code of Hammurabi," J.

In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, circa 1740 BC. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref> The ''coup de grace'' for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful [[Hittite Empire]], thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia.<ref name="D19">{{harvnb|DeBlois|1997|p=19}}</ref> However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, a people speaking a [[language isolate]], from the [[Zagros mountains]] region.
