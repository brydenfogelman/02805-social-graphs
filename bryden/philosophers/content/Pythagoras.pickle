Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of [[Samos]], and travelled, visiting [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]], and maybe [[India]].<ref name=Boyer /> Around 530 BC, he moved to [[Crotone|Croton]], in [[Magna Graecia]], and there established some kind of school or guild.  In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.\u000a\u000aPythagoras made influential contributions to [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great [[mathematician]] and [[scientist]] and is best known for the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which bears his name. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to [[mathematics]] or [[natural philosophy]]. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom,<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8\u20139 = [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58.

These writers, late as they are, were among the best sources from whom Porphyry and Iamblichus drew, while still adding some legendary accounts and their own inventions to the mix. Hence, historians are often reduced to considering the statements based on their inherent probability, but even then, if all the credible stories concerning Pythagoras were supposed true, his range of activity would be impossibly vast.<ref>{{DGRBM|inline=1|title=Pythagoras |https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/616/mode/1up |pages=616\u2013625}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000a{{See also|Pythagoras (sculptor)}}\u000a[[File:Pythagoras Bust Vatican Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Pythagoras, [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]]]]\u000aAccording to [[Clement of Alexandria]], Pythagoras was a disciple of [[Soches]], the Egyptian archprophet, and Plato of Sechnuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].

One of the two reports must be basically wrong: either Pythagoras withdrew to Metapontum before the outbreak of the unrest and died there (as Aristoxenus says) or he and his followers were hounded from city to city (as Dicaearchus has it). Like his doctrines, the life of Pythagoras also becomes a mirror image of real controversies in the schools.

When Pythagoras was asked, he said, \u2018to observe the heavens,\u2019 and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.

Possibly the tyranny of [[Polycrates]] in Samos made it difficult for him to achieve his schemes there. His later admirers claimed that Pythagoras was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens, that he moved to Croton.<ref>Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 28; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 9</ref> On his arrival in Croton, he quickly attained extensive influence, and many people began to follow him. Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speech in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.<ref>Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 18; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 37, etc.</ref>\u000a\u000aAccording to Diogenes Laërtius, his followers established a select brotherhood or club (see below school) for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic practices which developed. According to ''Diogenes Laërtius'', what was done and taught among the members was kept a secret. The [[esoteric]] teachings may have concerned science and mathematics, or religious doctrines, and may have been connected with the worship of Apollo.<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 13; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8, 91, 141</ref> Temperance of all kinds seems to have been strictly urged. There is disagreement among the biographers as to whether Pythagoras forbade all animal food,<ref>as Empedocles did afterwards, Aristotle, ''Rhet.'' i. 14. § 2; Sextus Empiricus, ix. 127. This was also one of the Orphic precepts, Aristoph. ''Ran.'' 1032</ref> or only certain types.<ref>Aristo ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 20; comp. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 7; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

The forces of Croton were headed by the Pythagorean [[Milo of Croton|Milo]], and it is likely that the members of the brotherhood took a prominent part. After the decisive victory by Croton, a proposal for establishing a more democratic constitution, was unsuccessfully resisted by the Pythagoreans. Their enemies, headed by [[Cylon of Croton|Cylon]] and [[Ninon of Croton|Ninon]], the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from the brotherhood, roused the populace against them. An attack was made upon them while assembled either in the house of Milo, or in some other meeting-place. The building was set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the younger and more active escaping.<ref>Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 255\u2013259; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 54\u201357; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 39; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' p. 583</ref> Similar commotions ensued in the other cities of Magna Graecia in which Pythagorean clubs had been formed.\u000a\u000aAs an active and organised brotherhood the Pythagorean order was everywhere suppressed, and did not again revive. Still the Pythagoreans continued to exist as a sect, the members of which kept up among themselves their religious observances and scientific pursuits, while individuals, as in the case of [[Archytas]], acquired now and then great political influence.\u000a\u000a==Writings==\u000a{{See also|Philolaus#Writings}}\u000a[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Sir William Smith, 1870)]]\u000aNo texts by Pythagoras are known to have survived, although forgeries under his name \u2014 a few of which remain extant \u2014 did circulate in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]].

It must, however, be stressed that the way in which the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources.<ref>There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone.

For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of [[Plato]] over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras. This attribution has stuck down the centuries up to modern times.<ref>From Christoph Riedweg , ''Pythagoras, His Life, Teaching and Influence'', Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2005: "Had Pythagoras and his teachings not been since the early Academy overwritten with Plato's philosophy, and had this 'palimpsest' not in the course of the Roman Empire achieved unchallenged authority among Platonists, it would be scarcely conceivable that scholars from the Middle Ages and modernity down to the present would have found the Presocratic charismatic from Samos so fascinating. In fact, as a rule it was the image of Pythagoras elaborated by Neopythagoreans and Neoplatonists that determined the idea of what was Pythagorean over the centuries."</ref> The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]].\u000a\u000a===Musical theories and investigations===\u000a[[File:Gaffurio Pythagoras.png|thumb|Medieval woodcut showing Pythagoras with bells and other instruments in Pythagorean tuning]]\u000a{{See also|Pythagorean tuning |Pythagorean hammers}} \u000aAccording to legend, the way Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations was when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and thought that the sounds emanating from their anvils were beautiful and harmonious and decided that whatever scientific law caused this to happen must be mathematical and could be applied to music. He went to the blacksmiths to learn how the sounds were produced by looking at their tools.  He discovered that it was because the [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] were "simple ratios of each other, one was half the size of the first, another was 2/3 the size, and so on".\u000a\u000aThis legend has since proven to be false by virtue of the fact that these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.<ref>Weiss, Piero, and Richard Taruskin, eds.

Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "[[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]". Thus the planets and stars moved according to mathematical equations, which corresponded to musical notes and thus produced a symphony.<ref>Christoph Riedweg, Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching and Influence, Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2005 .</ref>\u000a\u000a[[E.

The philosophy of the Acusmatici consisted in auditions unaccompanied with demonstrations and a reasoning process; because it merely ordered a thing to be done in a certain way and that they should endeavour to preserve such other things as were said by him, as divine dogmas. Memory was the most valued faculty. All these auditions were of three kinds; some signifying what a thing is; others what it especially is, others what ought or ought not to be done."

The early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] sculpture represents life in simple forms, and it seems that it was influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.<ref>" For [[Thales]], the origin was water, and for [[Anaximander]] the infinite ([[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]), which must be considered a material form": Homann-Wedeking, p. 63</ref> There was a general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms, and it was represented by a type (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2), which was mathematically calculated.<ref>"Every [[kouros]] statue seeks to embody the idea of a ''kouros''": Homann-Wedeking, p. 62</ref><ref name=Carpenter107>R. Carpenter (1959) ''The esthetic basis of Greek art'', Indiana University Press, pp. 107, 122, 128</ref> This can be observed in the construction of the first temples. The original forms were considered divine, and the forms of the later marble or stone elements indicate that there was an original wooden prototype.<ref>Nigel Spivey (1997) ''Greek art''. Phaedon Press Ltd, p. 116</ref> When the dimensions changed, the architects searched in mathematics some permanent principles behind the appearances of things. [[Maurice Bowra]] believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students who asserted that "all things are numbers".<ref>C. M. Bowra (1957). "The Greek experience". W. P. Company, p. 166</ref>\u000a\u000aDuring the 6th century BC, there was an evolution in the arts from the natural philosophies to the metaphysical theory of Pythagoras.<ref name=Homann64>Homann-Wedeking (1968) ''Art of the world. Archaic Geece'', pp. 62\u201365.</ref> The Greek sculptors and architects, tried to find the mathematical relation ([[aesthetic canon|canon]]), which would lead to the aesthetic perfection.<ref name=Carpenter107/> The sculptor [[Polykleitos]] in his ''Canon'' wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras.<ref>"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole": ''Canon of Polykleitos'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I.vi.i: Nigel Spivey, pp. 290\u2013294.</ref> The numbers were extensively used in the Greek architectural orders. In the architectural canons every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. The universe was controlled by the order, and even the sounds were functions of number and ratio. [[Rhys Carpenter]] says that he ratio 2:1 was the generative ratio of the [[Doric order]], and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."<ref name=Carpenter107/>\u000a\u000a===Influence on other groups===\u000aPythagoreanism may had an effect on [[Freemasonry]] and [[Rosicrucianism]], both of which were groups dedicated to the study of mathematics/[[geometry]] and logical reasoning as opposed to religious dogma. Both Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism have claimed to have evolved out of the Pythagorean Brotherhood. Pythagorean mathematics are discussed in a chapter of Manly P.
