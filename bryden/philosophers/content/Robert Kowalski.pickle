He was inducted as a Fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]] in 1991, of the European Co-ordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence in 1999, and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] in 2001.\u000a\u000aHe began his research in the field of [[automated theorem proving]], developing both SL-resolution<ref>Kowalski, R. and Kuehner, D., "Linear Resolution with Selection Function", in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 2, 1971, pp. 227\u2013260.
