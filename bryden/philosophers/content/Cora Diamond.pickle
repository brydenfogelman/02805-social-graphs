She is currently the Kenan Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the [[University of Virginia]].\u000a\u000a==Work==\u000aOne of Diamond's most famous articles, ''What Nonsense Might Be'', criticizes the way that the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] think about nonsense on [[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]] grounds (See [[category mistake]]). Another well-known article, ''Eating Meat and Eating People'', examines the rhetorical and philosophical nature of contemporary attitudes towards [[animal rights]]. Diamond's writings on both "early" (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' era) and "late" (''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' era) Wittgenstein have made her a leading influence in the [[New Wittgenstein|New Wittgenstinian]] approach advanced by [[Alice Crary]], [[James F. Conant]], and others.\u000a\u000aDiamond has published a collection of essays titled ''The Realistic Spirit: Wittgenstein, Philosophy, and the Mind.'' She is the editor of ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics: Cambridge 1939,'' a collection of lectures assembled from the notes of Wittgenstein's students [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Rush Rhees]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and R.G. Bosanquet.\u000a\u000a''Wittgenstein and the Moral Life: Essays in Honor of Cora Diamond'' (edited by [[Alice Crary]]<ref>http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/wittgenstein-and-moral-life</ref>) features essays by [[Alice Crary|Crary]], [[John McDowell]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Stanley Cavell]], and [[James F.
