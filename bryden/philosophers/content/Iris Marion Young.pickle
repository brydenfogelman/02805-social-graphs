She served as Professor of [[Political Science]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and was affiliated with the Center for Gender Studies and the Human Rights program there. Her research covered contemporary [[political theory]], [[Feminist theory|feminist social theory]], and normative analysis of [[public policy]]. She believed in the importance of political activism and encouraged her students to involve themselves in their communities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://solidarity-us.org/node/540|title=Iris M. Young, 1949-2006|last=Nagel|first=Mechthild|date=May-June 2007|website=|publisher=|access-date=July 31, 2016}}</ref>\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aYoung was born in [[New York City]] and studied philosophy and graduated with honors at Queens College. She was awarded a [[Master's degree]] and [[PhD]] in philosophy by [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1974.<ref name=":0" /> \u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aBefore coming to the University of Chicago she taught political theory for nine years in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and before then taught philosophy at several institutions, including the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] and [[Miami University]].<ref name=":0" /> During the summer term of 1995 Young was a Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. Young held visiting fellowships at several universities and institutes around the world, including the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the [[Institute for Human Sciences]] in [[Vienna]], the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Canterbury]] in [[New Zealand]], and the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa.\u000a\u000a==Philosophical contributions==\u000aYoung's interests ranged broadly, including contemporary theories of [[justice]]; [[democracy]] and difference; feminist political theory; continental political theory including [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]; [[ethics]] and [[international relations|international affairs]]; [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and public policy.\u000a\u000a===Social groups and the politics of difference===\u000aCentral to Young's philosophy is the contention that concepts of justice were not limited to individual [[desert (philosophy)|desert]]. Instead, the recognition of ''social groups'' was essential redressing structural inequalities. Because the social rules, laws, and institutional routines constraining certain people constrain them as a group, and because our awareness of injustice almost universally compares classes of people rather than individuals directly, our evaluations of inequality and injustice must recognize the salience of social groups as constituent of a complete theory of justice.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Young |first=Iris Marion |title=Equality of Whom? Social Groups and Judgements of Injustice |journal=The Journal of Political Philosophy |year=2001 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1-18 |url=http://www.consumerstar.org/resources/pdf/young.pdf}}</ref>\u000a\u000aYoung's recognition of social groups impelled her to argue for a post-liberal "politics of difference," in which equal treatment of individuals does not override the redress of group-based oppression. Young contrasted her approach with contemporary liberal political philosophers like [[John Rawls]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]], who she claims conflate the moral equivalence of people with procedural rules that treat all people equally.\u000a\u000a===Five Faces of Oppression===\u000aAmong Young's most widely disseminated ideas is her model of the "five faces of oppression," first published in ''Justice and the Politics of Difference'' (1990). Synthesizing feminist, queer, poststructuralist, and post-colonial critiques of classical Marxism, Young argued at least five distinct types of oppression could not be collapsed into more fundamental causes, and furthermore could not be reduced to dimensions of distributive justice.<ref name="FiveFaces2004">{{cite book |last=Young |first=Iris Marion |chapter=Five Faces of Oppression |title=Oppression, Privilege, and Resistance: Theoretical Perspectives on Racism, Sexism, and Heterosexism |editor1-last=Maree Heldke |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-last=O'Conor |editor2-first=Peg |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2004 |pages=37-63 |isbn= 9780072882438 |url=http://www.consumerstar.org/resources/pdf/young.pdf}}</ref> Her "five faces" are:\u000a\u000a*'''Exploitation'''\u000a*'''Marginalization''' \u000a*'''Powerlessness'''\u000a*'''Cultural domination'''\u000a*'''Violence'''\u000a\u000a=== Embodied Phenomenology ===\u000aOne of Young's most well-known essays is "[[Throwing Like a Girl: A Phenomenology of Feminine Body Comportment Motility and Spatiality]]," first published in ''Human Studies'' (1980). In it she explores differences in feminine and masculine movement in the context of a gendered and embodied phenomenological perspective<ref name=":0" /> based on ideas from [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. She discusses how girls are socialized and conditioned to restrict their body movement and think of their bodies as fragile, which then has repercussions for their confidence in accomplishing tasks and goals later in life.\u000a\u000a== Later life ==\u000aYoung died, aged 57, on 1 August 2006 after an 18-month struggle with [[esophageal cancer]].<ref>[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/060802.young.shtml Iris Marion Young, 1949-2006], 2 August 2006, accessed 19 December 2007</ref> \u000a\u000a== Memoriam activities ==\u000aIn recognition of her work with the Center for Gender Studies at the University of Chicago, the Center's distinguished faculty lecture series was renamed in her honor in November 2006.  In addition, the [[University of Pittsburgh]] Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Program, in collaboration with the [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs]], created the Iris Marion Young Award for Political Engagement in 2008 to honor Young's memory and to recognize faculty/staff, graduate, and undergraduate members of the University who impact the community.<ref>{{cite web | title = Iris Marion Young Award | publisher = Gender, sexuality, & women's studies program, University of Pittsburgh | url = http://www.gsws.pitt.edu/students/iris-marion-young-award | accessdate = 15 August 2014 }}</ref> Young was also honored at Penn State University through a series of gifts which created the Iris Marion Young Diversity Scholar Award as part of the association for Feminist Ethics and Social Theory's and the Rock Ethics Institute's Philosophy in an Inclusive Key Summer Institute.<ref>{{cite web | title = Iris Marion Young Award | publisher = Rock Ethiics Institute, The Pennsylvania State University | url = http://rockethics.psu.edu/education/piksi/ | accessdate = 23 March 2015 }}</ref> This Institute is designed to encourage undergraduate students from under-represented groups to consider future study in the field of philosophy.
