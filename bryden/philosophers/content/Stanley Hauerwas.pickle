Yet the training I received left an indelible mark on everything I do." (''Hannah's Child'', 36)</ref>\u000a\u000aHauerwas's family attended Pleasant Mound Methodist Church, where he experienced Baptism, Confirmation and Communion. At the age of 15, he presented himself for ministry at a Sunday night worship service, presuming then that he would be saved.<ref>Stanley Hauerwas, ''[https://www.academia.edu/12059569/The_Hauerwas_Reader The Hauerwas Reader]'', ed.

He was also a member of Phi Delta Theta while at Southwestern University. He went on to earn the [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil]] and PhD degrees from [[Yale University]]. Upon delivering the Gifford Lectures in 2001, Hauerwas was also awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]].\u000a\u000aFollowing his graduation from Yale University, Hauerwas taught first at [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in Rock Island, Illinois, before joining the faculty at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1970.<ref>Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 95.</ref> He was later invited to assume a faculty position at the Divinity School of Duke University in 1983,<ref>Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 173</ref> where he taught in the area of theological ethics until his retirement in 2013, though he continues to write and speak at Duke as a senior research fellow.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How to (Not) Retire Theologically {{!}} Reflections|url = http://reflections.yale.edu/article/test-time-art-aging/how-not-retire-theologically|website = reflections.yale.edu|access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref> In 2014 he was appointed to a Chair in Theological Ethics at the University of Aberdeen.<ref>https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/6458/</ref>\u000a\u000aHauerwas' influences are wide-ranging, including figures as diverse as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[John Howard Yoder]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[William James]].<ref>Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', ''passim''.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Honors==\u000a''[[Time Magazine]]'' in 2001 named him "America's Best Theologian".<ref>Jean Bethke Elshtain, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000859,00.html "Theologian: Christian Contrarian"], ''Time Magazine'' online edition, 17 September 2001.</ref> He responded by saying, "'Best' is not a theological category."<ref>{{cite book |last=Hauerwas |first=Stanley |date=2012 |title=Hannah's Child |publisher=Wm.

Such an argument is controversial since Karl Barth is well known as an enemy of [[natural theology]]. For Hauerwas, however, Barth argued that Christian convictions about the world describe God's good creation as it is while emphasizing that such convictions cannot be understood apart from Christian witness.<ref>''With the Grain of the Universe'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press,\u000a2001), 142.</ref> This, according to Hauerwas, is what makes Barth a proper natural theologian in comparison to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[William James]], who were also featured in the lectures.\u000a\u000aEarlier in 1997 he gave the ''[[Scottish Journal of Theology]]'' lectures at Aberdeen, published as ''Sanctify Them in Truth'' (1998).\u000a\u000a==Basic theological and philosophical views==\u000aHauerwas has long been associated with [[narrative theology]] and [[postliberal theology]] (which are closely related but not necessarily synonymous movements). Both of these movements are attached to Yale biblical scholars [[Brevard Childs]], [[Hans Wilhelm Frei|Hans Frei]], and [[George Lindbeck]]. His ''Reforming Christian Social Ethics: Ten Theses'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hauerwas|first1=Stanley|editor1-last=Berkman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Cartwright|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Hauerwas Reader|date=1981|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|pages=111\u2013115}}</ref> published in 1981, serves to summarize the key presuppositions of his alternative to what was the dominant account in Christian ethics at that time. The ten theses are listed as follows:\u000a\u000a# The social significance of the Gospel requires the recognition of the narrative structure of Christian convictions for the life of the church.\u000a# Every social ethic involves a narrative, whether it is concerned with the formulation of basic principles of social organization and/or with concrete policy alternatives.\u000a# The ability to provide an adequate account of our existence is the primary test of the truthfulness of a social ethic.\u000a# Communities formed by a truthful narrative must provide the skills to transform fate into destiny so that the unexpected, especially as it comes in the form of strangers, can be welcomed as gift. \u000a# The primary social task of the church is to be itself - that is, a people who have been formed by a story that provides them with the skills for negotiating the danger of this existence, trusting in God's promise of redemption. \u000a# Christian social ethics can only be done from the perspective of those who do not seek to control national or world history but who are content to live "out of control."\u000a# Christian social ethics depends on the development of leadership in the church that can trust and depend on the diversity of gifts in the community. \u000a# For the church to be, rather than to have, a social ethic means we must recapture the social significance of common behavior, such as acts of kindness, friendship, and the formation of families. \u000a# In our attempt to control our society Christians in America have too readily accepted liberalism as a social strategy appropriate to the Christian story. \u000a# The church does not exist to provide an ethos for democracy or any other form of social organization, but stands as a political alternative to every nation, witnessing to the kind of social life possible for those that have been formed by the story of Christ.\u000a\u000aHauerwas writes of narrative as "the necessary grammar of Christian convictions" in that Christian claims are inextricably linked to what God has done in history and to the ongoing story of God's people as they move through time. This sense of a "hypertemporal God" Hauerwas claims to have gotten from John Howard Yoder, who impressed upon him the need of always locating God's actions in the "timeliness" of the created order as witnessed by the Bible.<ref name="p158">Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 158.</ref> He has explained this understanding of a people (i.e., church) constituted by their ongoing story with God in terms of a pointed and oft-repeated aphorism:\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000aMy claim, so offensive to some, that '''the first task of the church is to make the world the world, not to make the world more just,''' is a correlative of this theological metaphysics. The world simply cannot be narrated - the world cannot have a story - unless a people exist who make the world the world. That is an eschatological claim that presupposes we know there was a beginning only because we have seen the end ... [C]reation names God's continuing action, God's unrelenting desire for us to want to be loved by that love manifest in Christ's life, death, and resurrection.<ref name="p158"/>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000aAs indicated in the quotation above, Hauerwas believes that the strong distinction between the church and the world is a necessary mark of the Christian life. He collaborated with [[William H. Willimon]] (now a retired bishop in the [[United Methodist Church]]) in 1989 to offer an accessible version of his vision of the Christian life in the book ''[[Resident Aliens|Resident Aliens: Life in the Christian Colony]]''.<ref>Stanley Hauerwas and William H. Willimon, ''Resident Aliens: Life in the Christian Colony'' (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1989)</ref> This understanding of the church is based on both his narrative and postliberal approach to theology, as well as his reading of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s understanding of language and [[language-game|language games]].<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Being+'other+cheeky'%3a+moral+hazard+and+the+thought+of+Stanley...-a0234140881</ref>\u000a\u000aHauerwas works from within the tradition of [[virtue ethics]], having been deeply influenced by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and his work ''[[After Virtue]]''.<ref>http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/09/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre-6</ref><ref name="mendeley">{{cite web|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/conceptual-problems-stanley-hauerwass-virtue-ethics/|title=Conceptual Problems for Stanley H... preview &amp; related info &#124; Mendeley|publisher=mendeley.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHauerwas is also known as an ardent critic of [[liberal democracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/henry/research/symposiumpapers/Symp09Bridges.pdf|format=PDF|title=\u2015Beyond Secular Liberalism, Theological Traditionalism, and Incomplete Pragmatism: A Milbankian Engagement with Jeffrey Stout\u2018s Democracy and Tradition|author=Thomas Bridges|publisher=Calvin.edu|accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref> In recent years, however, Hauerwas has become conversant with the tradition of [[radical democracy]].

Hauerwas frequently discusses the work of both Niebuhr brothers, mentioning them in some form in most of his books.

This represents the thesis of Hauerwas in his most popular book, ''[[Resident Aliens]]'' (which was co-written by [[William Willimon]]). In the book, Hauerwas and Willimon argue that the Church's accommodation to secular culture has led to tragedies like the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima<ref name="theinfo">{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/print/0109/feature.html|title=Lingua Franca - September 2001 &#124; Feature: For God, Not Country|publisher=linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhinet.org/polet22-1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Being \u2018Other Cheeky\u2019: Moral Hazard and the Thought of Stanley Hauerwas|author=Jeffrey Polet|publisher=Nhinet.org|accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref> Hauerwas, therefore, believes that the Niebuhrs' thinking is subject to the same flaws as [[Jerry Falwell]], with Hauerwas and Willimon stating that "few books have been a greater hindrance to an accurate assessment of [the Church's] situation" than H. Richard Niebuhr's famous book ''Christ and Culture''.<ref>Stanley Hauerwas and William Willimon, Resident Aliens: A Provocative Christian Assessment of Culture and Ministry for People Who Know That Something is Wrong (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1989), 31-40</ref> Thus according to Hauerwas, while they may have disagreed when it comes to policy, both the Niebuhrs and Falwell fell prey to the notion Christians have a duty to use the political process as a means to enact "Christian" legislation or pursue justice.\u000a\u000aIn his book ''The Peaceable Kingdom'' Hauerwas offers commentary on two classic essays written by the Niebuhrs for ''[[The Christian Century]]'' on the subject of the [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Conflict in Manchuria]]. In the first essay, entitled "The Grace of Doing Nothing", H. Richard Niebuhr argues that humans are self-interested and egoistic and that Christians, because they are subject to these same flaws, should remain non-violent even in a time of war. In his essay in response, entitled "Must We Do Nothing?", Reinhold Niebuhr argues that Christians must have a self-awareness about their own sinfulness and self-interestedness, but must sometimes use force to protect certain ideals and people. In his commentary Hauerwas acknowledges that both brothers make important points, but critiques Reinhold's view, ultimately agreeing with H. Richard Niebuhr.<ref name="religion-online4">{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=99|title=Niebuhr Versus Niebuhr: The Tragic Nature of History|publisher=religion-online.org|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Stanley Hauerwas, ''The Peaceable Kingdom: A Primer in Christian Ethics'' (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1983), 135-141.</ref>\u000a\u000a==Views on human experimentation==\u000a\u000a===Deontological and utilitarian thought===\u000aThe basic [[utilitarian]] rationalization for research on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a human being is justified by the possibility of successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest amount of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or a homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.\u000a\u000aThe [[deontological]] argument against research on human beings is that persons are an ends in themselves. This means we cannot use people for any purpose. The deontological argument relies on the belief that we should treat others as we would like to be treated. If someone was suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.\u000a\u000a===Understanding of experimentation===\u000aHauerwas finds these two moral theories very limiting because they are quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes that there needs to be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas\u2019s perspective is that there needs to be a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research there would be little medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes we do not have the moral understanding to handle current medicine.\u000a\u000aAs mentioned above, Hauerwas believes that the moral issue of experimentation on humans cannot be answered from a utilitarianism versus deontological perspective. He believes that society lacks a cohesive understanding of the notions of \u201cthe good of mankind\u201d and \u201cthe rights of the individual.\u201d  Only when this issue is solved can society come to a conclusive decision on how science should be used to serve humans needs. Therapeutic and nontherapeutic experimentation on humans are differentiated by the intent of the procedure. Therapeutic experimentation is meant to help the patient with their current needs, while nontherapeutic experimentation has no intention of helping the patient, but to collect research for the benefit of future patients. The issue becomes: should medical progress be helping the current patient or the future patient? Stanley Hauerwas believes society has no consensus of the meanings of health and illness, which contributes to the issue of how patients should be treated. Only when society comes to a universal understanding of these issues can the moral dilemma of experimentation on humans be resolved.\u000a\u000a===Informed consent===\u000aHauerwas finds little justification for human experimentation through informed consent. He argues that a patient\u2019s understanding of an experimental procedure will never approach that of his or her physician. He questions even the possibility of a patient reaching a state of \u201cinformed consent.\u201d He further believes that if individuals reach such a state of \u201cinformed consent\u201d, this does not mean individuals should consent, or fully understand the meaning of their consent. \u201cFor persons can misuse themselves even if they do so voluntarily and with full knowledge.\u201d<ref>Stanley Hauerwas, ''Suffering Presence: Theological Reflections on Medicine, the Mentally Handicapped, and the Church'' (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1986), 119.</ref> Individuals consenting to experimentation through the justification of the human good, turn themselves into objects for the use of the experimentation. The issue is further complicated for Hauerwas as to whom should be considered for medical experimentation. The use of prisoners only proliferates social stereotypes and denigration. He believes that informed consent is necessary for human experimentation, but it does not provide justification for our willingness to submit and participate in experimentation.\u000a\u000a===Language of rights===\u000aHauerwas finds the language of \u201crights\u201d to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even the understanding of the family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up in a way that is conducive to the community\u2019s values. Thus, the issue with \u201crights\u201d language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas\u2019s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.\u000a\u000a==Views on death and dying well==\u000aHauerwas believes that there is a difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death \u201cinvolves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has happened in a person\u201d<ref name="p89">Hauerwas, ''Suffering Presence'', p89.</ref> and therefore \u201cis a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., \u2026 the potential for consciousness\u201d.<ref name="p89"/> The criteria of death, however, are \u201cthose empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG\u201d.<ref name="p89"/> Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve \u201cas a symbol of when it is time to die\u201d.<ref>Hauerwas, ''Suffering Presence'', p98.</ref> A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of suicide, Hauerwas challenges the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an \u201cautonomous\u201d agent, but does not agree with the notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term "rational suicide" is based on the assumption that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.\u000a\u000aAccording to Hauerwas, a \u201cgood death is a death that we can prepare for through living because we are able to see that death is but a necessary correlative to a good life." A long life may give a person more of a chance to have a good death because he may be able to get himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring for us to see that they are sustaining us.\u000a\u000a==Views of patience and courage==\u000aAccording to his essay, "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in ''Christians Among the Virtues'', he said that Christians are called to be patient patients in sickness and in health because "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." He also says that God showed us the best example of patience when it comes to the life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that \u201conly patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that patience is not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for \u201cwithout [love] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [love] of God which endures all things.\u201d In the author\u2019s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick:\u000a1.	We have been given one another to learn to live with one another.\u000a2.	We\u2019ve been given time and space to develop habits from activities that require patience.<ref>Hauerwas, S., & Pinches, C. R. (1997). "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", ''Christians Among the Virtues: Theological Conversations with Ancient and Modern Ethics'' (pp. 166-178). Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press.</ref>\u000a\u000aHauerwas speaks about courage in his essay "Courage Exemplified", in ''Christians Among the Virtues''. He first looked to Aristotle, who firmly believed soldiers could only show courage. He also said that courage is acquired through imitation of action and emotion, and virtue required practice before it was mastered. Hauerwas indicated that to Aristotle, \u201cwithout war, courage could not be fully known." The philosopher also spoke of Aquinas\u2019 view of courage. To begin, he expressed that to Aquinas, charity is the central trunk from which all the other virtues branch out, which includes courage. In contrast to Aristotle, courage isn\u2019t just for battlefield; it adds any situation one might face danger and death, such as tending to the sick bed of loved one or going on a walk into the unknown with a friend. According to the essay, Aquinas \u201ctreats fortitude in such a way that its ends are transformed by charity.\u201d Even though a situation might be dangerous, the individual is courageous because they possess love for the person they are helping. Courage, then, is more accessible opposed to Aristotle\u2019s view.\u000aTo transition, Hauerwas added the Christian to the mix when he narrated that Christianity requires courage which is \u201ca kind of endurance in the face of difficulty, danger, or oppression." To tie in the first essay, he went on to say that patience and perseverance are \u201cintegral to the very meaning of virtue." All of this is to say that the Christian must have the patience to get through tough times. To him, the ultimate display of courage is through the martyr, who is \u201crequired to patiently persevere, since they have the confidence that enduring wrong is the gift of charity." The philosopher also highlighted that true courage is a gift of the Holy Spirit when he said that \u201ccourage is a gift of the Spirit that protects the martyr from the \u2018dread of danger.\u2019" The martyr is the best example because they believe that \u201cGod will complete God\u2019s work in [them] even if [their] lives are taken by [the] enemies." In the eyes of both Aquinas the Hauerwas, \u201cthose formed by the courage necessary to face death well will be more easily led to the fuller amount of courage offered by Christians."\u000a\u000aOverall, Hauerwas believes that America is not courageous because it does not act out of charity. He believes that the church can do it, but he questions whether America as a whole is able to. His answer is that it cannot. \u201cWe in America have lost our moral vision precisely as we have lost our courage to fight for what is right and good." <ref>Hauerwas, S., & Pinches, C. R. (1997).
