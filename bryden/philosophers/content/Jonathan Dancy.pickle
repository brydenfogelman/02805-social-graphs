He is currently Research Professor at the [[University of Reading]] and Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Texas at Austin]].\u000a\u000a==Career==\u000aDancy was educated at [[Winchester College]], where he was [[Head Boy]] and played cricket for the school, and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he obtained a double first in classics (1965-7:Classical Honour Moderations:  First Class Honours; 1967-9:   Literae Humaniores:  First Class Honours, BA).<ref name=CV>{{cite web | url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/files/4071124 | title=Jonathan Dancy | accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> \u000a\u000aAfter graduating he served as a lecturer at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] for a year. In 1971 he became a lecturer at [[Keele University]], becoming professor there in 1991.<ref name=CV/> \u000a\u000aAfter being mentioned by his daughter-in-law, American actress [[Claire Danes]], during an appearance on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', Dancy appeared as a guest on the program on 1 April 2010.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VthiiIhN3wg</ref>\u000a\u000aHe was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2016.<ref>http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-announces-new-president-and-elects-66-new-fellows</ref>\u000a\u000a==Philosophical Work==\u000a\u000aAfter having worked on problems of [[epistemology]], and more particularly on the nature of perception ([[argument from illusion]]), he emerged as the leading proponent in ethics of [[moral particularism]], the idea that all moral reasons are particular and context-sensitive, rather than general. He also defends what he calls the [[holism]] of reasons, namely the idea that a consideration that is a reason for acting in a certain way in one case may not be a reason for acting in that way, or even a reason for not acting in that way, in other cases. In this sense, reasons are context-dependent. Dancy argues that the holism of reasons provides a major support for the main claim of his particularism, i.e., that there are no moral ''principles'' but that ''morality'' can get on perfectly well without them. Dancy edited some of [[George Berkeley]] writings<ref name=Parigi>Silvia Parigi. [http://people.hsc.edu/berkeleystudies/berkbib.php Berkeley Bibliography (1979-2010)]</ref> and dedicated a book to the [[Anglo-Irish]] thinker.<ref name=Parigi />\u000a\u000a==Personal life==\u000aIn 1973 he married Sarah Birley; they have three children the actor [[Hugh Dancy]], husband of actress [[Claire Danes]]; Jack Dancy who runs a travel company and Kate Redman<ref>https://www.twitter.com/rougewoman</ref> who works for UNESCO.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000a\u000a===Articles===\u000a* "On Moral Properties", ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', 1981, XC, pp.&nbsp;367\u2013385.\u000a*\u201cEthical Particularism and Morally Relevant Properties.\u201d  ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', n.s.; 92, 368 (Oct., 1983): 530 \u2013 547.\u000a*\u201cThe Role of Imaginary Cases in Ethics.\u201d  ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', 66 (1985): 141 \u2013 153.\u000a* \u201cAn Ethic of Prima Facie Duties.\u201d  In ''A Companion to Ethics'', ed.
