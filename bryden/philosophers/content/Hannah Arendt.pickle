As a university student, Arendt was very excited to be taught by Heidegger, about whom she later recalled: "Little more than a name was known, but the name made its way through all of Germany like the rumor of a secret king."<ref name=newyorker/> During the philosophy course taught by Heidegger, she fell in love with her married professor, and a relationship began.<ref name=newyorker/> Writing about her relationship with Heidegger in the third person, Arendt recalled: "Her sensitivity and vulnerability, which had always given her an exclusive air, grew to almost grotesque proportions."<ref name=newyorker/> In 1929, when Heidegger failed to recognize her at a train station, Arendt was devastated, writing: "When I was a small child, that was the way my mother once stupidly and playfully frightened me. I had read the fairy tale about Dwarf Nose, whose nose gets so long nobody recognizes him anymore. My mother pretended that had happened to me. I still vividly recall the blind terror with which I kept crying: but I am your child, I am your Hannah.\u2014That is what it was like today."<ref name=newyorker/>\u000a\u000aIn the wake of one of their breakups, Arendt moved to the [[University of Heidelberg]], where in 1929 she completed her [[dissertation]] under the existentialist philosopher-psychologist [[Karl Jaspers]]; her thesis title was ''{{ill|de|Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin|Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin|Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation}}'' ("On the concept of love in the thought of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation). In 1929, in Berlin, she married Günther Stern, later known as [[Günther Anders]].  (They divorced in 1937.) The dissertation was published in 1929. In 1932, Arendt was deeply troubled by reports that Heidegger was speaking at National Socialist meetings, and wrote to him asking him to deny that he was attracted to National Socialism. Heidegger wrote back to her and in his letter did not seek to deny the rumors (which were true), and merely assured her that his feelings for her were unchanged.<ref name=newyorker/> Arendt was prevented from [[Habilitation|habilitating]] because she was Jewish. She researched [[antisemitism]] for some time before being arrested and briefly imprisoned by the [[Gestapo]] in 1933.<ref>http://biography.yourdictionary.com/hannah-arendt</ref>\u000a\u000a===Paris===\u000aIn 1933, Arendt left Germany for [[Czechoslovakia]] and then [[Geneva]], where she worked for some time at the [[League of Nations]] before leaving for [[Paris]], where she befriended the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]], her first husband's cousin. While in France, she worked to support and aid Jewish refugees. In 1937, she was stripped of her [[German nationality law|German citizenship]]. In 1940, she married the German poet and [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Heinrich Blücher]], a founding member of the [[KPD]] who had been expelled due to his work in the [[Conciliator faction]]. Later that year, after the German [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|military occupation of northern France]], the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] began deporting foreign Jews to [[internment camp]]s in the unoccupied south of France, and she was interned in [[Camp Gurs]] as an "enemy alien".\u000a\u000a===New York===\u000aLike many others, Arendt was able to leave Gurs after a few weeks, and left France in 1941 with her husband and her mother, traveling via Portugal to the United States. They relied on visas illegally issued by the American diplomat [[Hiram Bingham IV|Hiram Bingham]], who aided roughly 2,500 Jewish refugees in this way. [[Varian Fry]], another American humanitarian, paid for their travel and helped obtain the visas. Upon arriving in [[New York City|New York]], Arendt became active in the German-Jewish community. From 1941 to 1945, she wrote a column for the German-language Jewish newspaper ''[[Aufbau]]''.

Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, Galicians, but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic.

In it, Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a "novel form of government," different from other forms of tyranny in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries.<ref>[http://contemporarythinkers.org/hannah-arendt/introduction/ contemporarythinkers.org]</ref> The book was opposed by some on the Left on the grounds that it presented the two movements as equally tyrannical. She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy. Totalitarianism in Germany was, in the end, about terror and consistency, not eradicating Jews only.\u000a\u000a===''The Human Condition''===\u000a{{Main|The Human Condition (book)|l1=The Human Condition}}\u000a\u000aIn what is arguably her most influential work, ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958), Arendt differentiates political and social concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social-being part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally constructed by only a few of these societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom through the construction of a common world. These conceptual categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as the political that is both existential and aesthetic.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/#AreConMod "Arendt" entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Section 3]</ref>\u000a\u000a===''Men in Dark Times''===\u000aHer collection of essays, ''Men in Dark Times'', presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the twentieth century, such as [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Hermann Broch]], [[Pope John XXIII]], and [[Isak Dinesen]].\u000a\u000a===''Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil''===\u000a{{Main|Eichmann in Jerusalem}}\u000a\u000aIn her reporting of the 1961 [[Adolf Eichmann]] trial for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which evolved into ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]]'' (1963), she coined the phrase "the [[banality of evil]]" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She raised the question of whether [[evil]] is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions and inaction. She was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in [[Israel]]. She also was critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably [[Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski|M.C. Rumkowski]], acted during [[the Holocaust]]. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend [[Gershom Scholem]], a major scholar of [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism, neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew until 1999.<ref>Elon, Amos. Introduction. Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil. By Hannah Arendt. New York: Penguin, 2006, xxi.</ref>\u000a\u000aArendt ended the book by writing: {{quote|Just as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations\u2014as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world\u2014we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.}}\u000a\u000a===''On Revolution''===\u000a\u000aArendt presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the eighteenth century, the American and French Revolutions. She goes against a common view of both Marxist and leftist views when she argues that France, while well studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom in order to focus on compassion for the masses. In America, the Founding Fathers never betray the goal of Constitutio Libertatis. However, Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men had been lost, and advocates a \u201ccouncil system\u201d as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.\u000a\u000a===''On Violence''===\u000a\u000aArendt's essay ''On Violence'' distinguishes between violence and power. She maintains that, although theorists of both the Left and Right regard violence as an extreme manifestation of power, the two concepts are, in fact, antithetical. Power comes from the collective will and does not need violence to achieve any of its goals, since voluntary compliance takes its place. As governments start losing their legitimacy, violence becomes an artificial means toward the same end and is, therefore, found only in the absence of power. Bureaucracies then become the ideal birthplaces of violence since they are defined as the "rule by no one" against whom to argue and, therefore, recreate the missing links with the people they rule over.\u000a\u000a===''The Life of the Mind''===\u000a\u000aHer posthumous book, ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978, edited by [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]), remained incomplete.  During Arendt's tenure at the New School, in 1974, she presented a graduate level Political Philosophy class entitled, "Philosophy of the Mind". It was during these class lectures that Arendt crystallized her concepts. The class was based on her working draft of "Philosophy of the Mind", which was later edited to "Life of the Mind". Arendt's working draft of Philosophy of the Mind was distributed to graduate students at the New School during her visiting professorship in 1974. Also, stemming from her [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland, her last writing focused on the mental faculties of thinking and willing. In a sense, Life of the Mind went beyond her previous work concerning the ''vita activa''. In her discussion of thinking she focuses mainly on [[Socrates]] and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between Me and Myself. This appropriation of Socrates leads her to introduce novel concepts of conscience (which gives no positive prescriptions, but instead, tells me what I cannot do if I would remain friends with myself when I re-enter the two-in-one of thought where I must render an account of my actions to myself) and morality (an entirely negative enterprise concerned with non-participation in certain actions for the sake of remaining friends with one's self).\u000a\u000a=== Arendt's critique of human rights ===\u000aIn ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' Hannah Arendt devotes a lengthy chapter to a critical analysis of human rights. Arendt isn\u2019t skeptical of the notion of political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Origins of Totalitarianism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLrKGGxBKjAC|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date = 1973-03-21|isbn = 0547543158|first = Hannah|last = Arendt|pages = 389}}</ref> Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable and possessed simply in virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed in virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt\u2019s primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = 2011-04-05|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 17\u201319}}</ref> She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.\u000a\u000aArendt\u2019s analysis draws on the refugee upheavals in the first half of the 20th century along with her own experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons for whom no state was willing to legally recognize.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Origins of Totalitarianism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLrKGGxBKjAC|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date = 1973-03-21|isbn = 0547543158|first = Hannah|last = Arendt|pages = 379\u201381}}</ref> The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = The Origins of Totalitarianism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLrKGGxBKjAC|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date = 1973-03-21|isbn = 0547543158|first = Hannah|last = Arendt|pages = 378\u201384}}</ref> Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success.<ref name=":0" /> This was primarily due to resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Origins of Totalitarianism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLrKGGxBKjAC|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date = 1973-03-21|isbn = 0547543158|first = Hannah|last = Arendt|pages = 379}}</ref> Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum were capable of handling the sheer amount of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.\u000a\u000aArendt argues that the consistent mistreatment of refugees, most of whom were placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, they must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = 2011-04-05|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 27\u201329}}</ref> Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state, national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = 2011-04-05|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 239\u201340}}</ref> This presents a dilemma for liberalism in that liberal theorists are typically committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.\u000a\u000aSome critics find anti-black racism in Arendt's works, including her references to "savages" in Africa and her analysis of the right of white Americans to enforce racial segregation. <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Hannah-Arendt-white-supremacist-456007 Hannah Arendt, white supremacist] The Jerusalem Post, June 5, 2016</ref> Arendt wrote of segregation: \u2018The right to free association, and therefore to discrimination, has greater validity than the principle of equality," and that therefore there cannot be a right to enter any hotel or recreation area.<ref> Kathryn T.

Nevertheless, although her notion of judging remains unknown, Arendt did leave manuscripts (such as ''Thinking and Moral Considerations'' and ''Some Questions on Moral Philosophy'') and lectures (''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'') concerning her thoughts on this mental faculty. The first two articles were edited and published by [[Jerome Kohn]], an assistant of Arendt and a director of the Hannah Arendt Center at [[The New School]] in New York, and the last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, professor of political science at the [[University of Toronto]]. Her personal library was deposited at [[Bard College]] at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, [[ephemera]], and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment. The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.edu/arendtcollection|title=Hannah Arendt Collection at Stevenson Library, Bard College|publisher=Bard.edu|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==In popular culture==\u000a* The German film ''[[Hannah Arendt (film)|Hannah Arendt]]'' (2012) by director [[Margarethe von Trotta]] was based on a screenplay by Pamela Katz and the director; it focused on the era in Arendt's life when she reported for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on the war crimes trial of the [[Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Eichmann]].\u000a* The Latin American [[Spanglish]] novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' (1998) by [[Giannina Braschi]] features a comic scene in which artists, poets, and philosophers debate Arendt\u2019s theories, citing \u201cThe Owl of Minerva\u201d and [[Buridan\u2019s Ass]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Yo-Yo Boing!, Introduction by Doris Sommer, Harvard University|publisher=Latin American Literary Review Press|date=1998|ISBN=0-935480-97-8}}</ref>\u000a*The second episode of [[Maria Bamford]]'s show [[Lady Dynamite]] makes a brief reference to Arendt's concept of "the banality of evil".\u000a*In the film "Irrational Man" (2015) by Woody Allen, Abe uses a quote from her in a "crime and punishment" book ("the banality of evil")\u000a\u000a==Commemoration==\u000a* The [[asteroid]] [[100027 Hannaharendt]] is [[Meanings of asteroid names|named in her honor]].\u000a* The German railway authority operates a Hannah Arendt Express between [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Hanover]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/855456.html|title=All aboard the Arendt express|newspaper=Haaretz|date=3 May 2007|first=Yehouda|last=Shenhav|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>\u000a* The [[Hannah Arendt Center|Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities]] at [[Bard College]] is named in her honor.\u000a* The [[Hannah Arendt Center]] at [[The New School]] is named in her honor.\u000a* The [[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]] is named in her honor.\u000a* The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.\u000a* Various [[gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasiums (German high schools)]] have been dedicated to Arendt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hagh.bildung-rp.de/haghp/homepage.php|title=Hannah Arendt Gymnasium, Haßloch|publisher=Hagh.bildung-rp.de|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.han-nah.de/news.php |title=Hannah Arendt Gymnasium, Barsinghausen |publisher=Han-nah.de |date=17 September 2012 |accessdate=24 September 2012 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915105727/http://www.han-nah.de/news.php |archivedate=15 September 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hag-lengerich.de|title=Hannah Arendt Gymnasium, Lengerich|publisher=Hag-lengerich.de|accessdate=24 September 2012|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hag-berlin.net|title=Hannah Arendt Gymnasium, Berlin|publisher=Hag-berlin.net|accessdate=24 September 2012|language=German}}</ref>\u000a* The portrait of Hannah Arendt by the photographer [[Fred Stein]] has become famous.<ref>Kasper Heinrich: Fotografien von Fred Stein: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/fotografien-von-fred-stein-im-juedischen-museum-berlin-a-934199.html Der Poet mit der Kleinbildkamera]''.
