Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|150px|Hegel's [[political philosophy]] could be read in liberal or conservative directions.]]\u000aThe '''Right Hegelians''' ({{lang-de|Rechtshegelianer}}), '''Old Hegelians''' (''Althegelianer''), or '''the Hegelian Right''' (''die Hegelsche Rechte''), were those followers of [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in the early 19th century who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously [[conservative]] direction.  They are typically contrasted with the [[Young Hegelians]], who interpreted Hegel's [[political philosophy]] to support innovations in politics or religion.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2026775|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|date=1987 |title= The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel and Habermas|last=Dallmayr|first=Fred|volume=84|pages=682\u2013692}}</ref>\u000a\u000a==Overview==\u000aHegel's [[historicism]] held that both ideas and nations could only be understood by understanding their history.  Throughout his life, Hegel was an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] member of [[Prussia]]'s [[Lutheran]] Church.  He devoted considerable attention to [[the Absolute]], his term for the totality of reality that was used in his philosophy to justify [[existence of God|belief in God]].  In his ''Philosophy of Right'', Hegel wrote that:\u000a\u000a{{quotation|The [[Sovereign state|State]] is absolutely rational inasmuch as it is the actuality of the substantial will which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness once that consciousness has been raised to consciousness of its universality. This substantial unity is an absolute unmoved end in itself, in which freedom comes into its supreme right. On the other hand this final end has supreme right against the individual, whose supreme duty is to be a member of the State.<ref>Cf. Hegel, Georg H. W. 1821. Philosophy of Right. Trad. S. W.

Hegel's historicism could be read to affirm the historical inevitability of modern institutions; a [[nation]] was an [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]], existing in Hegelian [[idealism]] above and about the people who constituted it.  To argue for political change was to attack the Ideal of the national state.  The Right Hegelians believed that advanced [[Europe]]an societies, as they existed in the first half of the nineteenth century, were the summit of all social development, the product of the historical [[dialectic]] that had existed thus far.  Most praised the Prussian state, which enjoyed an extensive [[civil service]] system, good universities, [[industrialization]], and high [[employment]], as the acme of progress and the incarnation of the ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.\u000a\u000aMany of the members of the Hegelian right went on to have distinguished careers in public academia or the Lutheran Church.  As a school, they were closely associated with the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and held many of the chairs of philosophy and theology there.  Generally, the philosophers of the Hegelian right have been neglected; their fame, if not their reputations, has been eclipsed by the [[Young Hegelians]], including [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Karl Marx]]. They left their mark chiefly in theology.  Their efforts did not have the intended effect of bolstering a sense of the inevitability of faith as a product of history; rather, they pioneered the introduction of [[higher criticism]] by demonstrating the influence of an era on the development of Christianity.\u000a\u000aPhilosophers within the camp of the Hegelian right include:\u000a\u000a* [[Karl Friedrich Göschel]]\u000a* [[Georg Andreas Gabler]]\u000a* [[Johann Philipp Gabler]]\u000a* [[Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm Hinrichs]]\u000a* [[Karl Daub]]\u000a* [[Heinrich Leo]]\u000a* [[Leopold von Henning]]\u000a* [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]]\u000a\u000aOther thinkers or historians who may be included among the Hegelian right, with some reservations, include:\u000a\u000a* [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz]]\u000a* [[Eduard Gans]]\u000a* [[Karl Ludwig Michelet]]\u000a* [[Philip Marheineke]]\u000a* [[Wilhelm Vatke]]\u000a* [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]]\u000a* [[Eduard Zeller]]\u000a* [[Max Schasler]]\u000a* [[Albert Schwegler]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a[[Category:Political philosophy]]\u000a[[Category:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]
