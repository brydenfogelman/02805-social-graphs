His research career involved [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]]. His work on [[automata theory]] earned him the [[ACM Turing Award]] in 1976, while his collaborative work with [[Christopher Strachey]] in the 1970s laid the foundations of modern approaches to the [[semantics of programming languages]]. He has worked also on [[modal logic]], [[topology]], and [[category theory]].\u000a\u000a==Early career==\u000aHe received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Mathematics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1954. He wrote his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. thesis]] on ''Convergent Sequences of Complete Theories'' under the supervision of [[Alonzo Church]] while at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and defended his thesis in 1958. [[Solomon Feferman]] (2005) writes of this period:\u000a\u000a{{quote|''Scott began his studies in logic at Berkeley in the early 50s while still an undergraduate.  His unusual abilities were soon recognized and he quickly moved on to graduate classes and seminars with [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] and became part of the group that surrounded him, including me and [[Richard Montague]]; so it was at that time that we became friends.  Scott was clearly in line to do a Ph. D. with Tarski, but they had a falling out for reasons explained in our biography.<ref>Feferman & Feferman 2004.</ref>  Upset by that, Scott left for Princeton where he finished with a Ph. D. under Alonzo Church.  But it was not long before the relationship between them was mended to the point that Tarski could say to him, "I hope I can call you my student."''}}\u000a\u000aAfter completing his Ph.D. studies, he moved to the [[University of Chicago]], working as an instructor there until 1960.  In 1959, he published a joint paper with [[Michael O. Rabin]], a colleague from Princeton, titled ''Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem'' (Scott and Rabin 1959) which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines to [[automata theory]]. This work led to the joint bestowal of the [[Turing Award]] on the two, for the introduction of this fundamental concept of [[computational complexity theory]].\u000a\u000a==University of California, Berkeley, 1960\u20131963==\u000aScott took up a post as Assistant Professor of Mathematics, back at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and involved himself with classical issues in [[mathematical logic]], especially [[set theory]] and Tarskian [[model theory]].\u000a\u000aDuring this period he started supervising Ph.D. students, such as James Halpern (''Contributions to the Study of the Independence of the Axiom of Choice'') and [[Edgar Lopez-Escobar]] (''Infinitely Long Formulas with Countable Quantifier Degrees'').\u000a\u000a===Modal and tense logic===\u000aScott also began working on [[modal logic]] in this period, beginning a collaboration with [[John Lemmon]], who moved to [[Claremont, California]], in 1963.  Scott was especially interested in [[Arthur Prior]]'s approach to [[tense logic]] and the connection to the treatment of time in natural-language semantics, and began collaborating with [[Richard Montague]] (Copeland 2004), whom he had known from his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley.  Later, Scott and Montague independently discovered an important generalisation of [[Kripke semantics]] for modal and tense logic, called [[Scott-Montague semantics]] (Scott 1970).\u000a\u000aJohn Lemmon and Scott began work on a modal-logic textbook that was interrupted by Lemmon's death in 1966.  Scott circulated the incomplete monograph amongst colleagues, introducing a number of important techniques in the semantics of model theory, most importantly presenting a refinement of ''canonical model'' that became standard, and introducing the technique of constructing models through ''filtrations'', both of which are core concepts in modern Kripke semantics (Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema, 2001).  Scott eventually published the work as ''An Introduction to Modal Logic'' (Lemmon & Scott, 1977).\u000a\u000a==Stanford, Amsterdam and Princeton, 1963\u20131972==\u000aFollowing an initial observation of [[Robert Solovay]], Scott formulated the concept of [[Boolean-valued model]], as Solovay and [[Petr Vop\u011bnka]] did likewise at around the same time. In 1967 Scott published a paper, ''A Proof of the Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis'', in which he used Boolean-valued models to provide an alternate analysis of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] to that provided by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]]. This work led to the award of the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] in 1972.\u000a\u000a==Oxford University, 1972\u20131981==\u000aScott took up a post as Professor of Mathematical Logic on the Philosophy faculty of [[Oxford University]] in 1972. He was member of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] while at Oxford and is now an Honorary Fellow of the college.\u000a\u000a===Semantics of programming languages===\u000aThis period saw Scott working with [[Christopher Strachey]], and the two\u000amanaged, despite administrative pressures, to do work on providing a mathematical foundation for the semantics of programming languages, the work for which Scott is best known{{opinion|date=January 2016}}. Together, their work constitutes the Scott-Strachey approach to [[denotational semantics]]; it constitutes one of the pieces of work in [[theoretical computer science]] and can perhaps be regarded as founding one of the schools of [[computer science]]. One of Scott's contributions is his formulation of [[domain theory]], allowing programs involving recursive functions and looping-control constructs to be given denotational semantics. Additionally, he provided a foundation for the understanding of infinitary and continuous information through domain theory and his theory of [[Scott information system|information systems]].\u000a\u000aScott's work of this period led to the bestowal of:\u000a*The 1990 [[Harold Pender Award]] for his ''application of concepts from logic and algebra to the development of mathematical semantics of programming languages'';\u000a*The 1997 [[Rolf Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] for ''his conceptually oriented logical works, especially the creation of domain theory, which has made it possible to extend Tarski's semantical paradigm to programming languages as well as to construct models of Curry's combinatory logic and Church's calculus of lambda conversion''; and\u000a*The 2001 [[Bolzano Prize]] for Merit in the Mathematical Sciences by the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]].\u000a*The 2007 [[EATCS]] Award for his contribution to theoretical computer science.\u000a\u000a==Carnegie Mellon University 1981\u20132003==\u000aAt [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Scott proposed the theory of [[equilogical spaces]] as a successor theory to domain theory; among its many advantages, the category of equilogical spaces is a [[cartesian closed category]], whereas the category of domains<ref>Where here Dana Scott counts the category of domains to be the category whose objects are pointed [[Complete partial order|DCPO]]s, and whose morphisms are the strict, [[Scott-continuous]] functions</ref> is not. In 1994, he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-14.</ref>\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a*[[Scott's trick]]\u000a*[[Scott\u2013Potter set theory]]\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a\u000a===Works by Scott===\u000a* With [[Michael O.
