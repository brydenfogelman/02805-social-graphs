The CCC became world-famous when its members exposed security flaws in [[Germany]]'s "[[Bildschirmtext]]" (Btx) online television service by getting a bank to send them [[German mark|DM]] 134,000 for accessing its Btx page many times. They returned the money the following day.\u000a\u000aFrom 1983 he was a columnist for the Berlin-based ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'', often reporting on the [[Bulletin board system|BBS scene]] and the computer underground.\u000a\u000aHolland also co-founded the CCC's hacker magazine ''[[Datenschleuder]]'' in 1984, which praised the possibilities of global information networks and powerful [[computer]]s, and included detailed [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] diagrams for building [[modem]]s cheaply. The then-monopolist telephone company of Germany's [[Deutsche Bundespost]] had to approve modems and sold expensive, slow modems of their own. The telecommunications branch of Deutsche Bundespost was privatized and is now [[Deutsche Telekom]].\u000a\u000aBecause of Holland's continuing participation in the club, the CCC gained popularity and credibility. He gave speeches on information control for the government and the private sector. Holland fought against [[copy protection]] and all forms of [[censorship]] and for an open information infrastructure. He compared the censorship demands by some governments to those of the [[Christian]] church in the [[Middle Ages]] and regarded copy protection as a [[product defect]]. In his last years, he spent a lot of his time at a youth centre teaching children both the ethics and the technology of hacking,.<ref name="tp9195">[http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/9/9195/1.html Hacken als Form der Gesellschaftskritik] - Telepolis</ref>\u000a\u000a== Personal life ==\u000aHolland was born in [[Kassel]], and grew up in [[Marburg]], [[Hesse]].
