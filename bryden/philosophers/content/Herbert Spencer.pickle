Spencer's father was a religious dissenter who drifted from [[Methodism]] to [[Quaker]]ism, and who seems to have transmitted to his son an opposition to all forms of authority. He ran a school founded on the progressive teaching methods of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and also served as Secretary of the [[Derby Philosophical Society]], a scientific society which had been founded in the 1790s by [[Erasmus Darwin]], the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]].\u000a\u000aSpencer was educated in empirical science by his father, while the members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, particularly those of [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer,<ref>Rev. Thomas Spencer (14 October 1796 \u2013 26 January. 1853) \u2013 See: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26138/?back=,36208</ref> vicar of [[Hinton Charterhouse]] near [[Bath, England|Bath]], completed Spencer's limited formal education by teaching him some mathematics and physics, and enough [[Latin]] to enable him to translate some easy texts. Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Otherwise, Spencer was an autodidact who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' pp. 53\u201355</ref>\u000a\u000aAs both an adolescent and a young man Spencer found it difficult to settle to any intellectual or professional discipline. He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in their politics. From 1848 to 1853 he served as sub-editor on the free-trade journal ''[[The Economist]]'', during which time he published his first book, ''[[Social Statics]]'' (1851), which predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state.\u000a\u000aIts publisher, [[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]], introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[George Henry Lewes]] and Mary Ann Evans ([[George Eliot]]), with whom he was briefly romantically linked. Spencer himself introduced the biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], who would later win fame as 'Darwin's Bulldog' and who remained his lifelong friend. However it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill's ''A System of Logic'' and with [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] and which set him on the road to his life's work. He strongly disagreed with Comte.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' p. 113</ref>\u000a\u000aThe first fruit of his friendship with Evans and Lewes was Spencer's second book, ''Principles of Psychology'', published in 1855, which explored a physiological basis for psychology. The book was founded on the fundamental assumption that the human mind was subject to [[natural laws]] and that these could be discovered within the framework of general biology. This permitted the adoption of a developmental perspective not merely in terms of the individual (as in traditional psychology), but also of the species and the race. Through this paradigm, Spencer aimed to reconcile the [[associationist psychology]] of Mill's ''Logic'', the notion that human mind was constructed from atomic sensations held together by the laws of the association of ideas, with the apparently more 'scientific' theory of [[phrenology]], which located specific mental functions in specific parts of the brain.<ref>In 1844, Spencer published three articles on phrenology in [[The Zoist|The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology & Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare]]: "''A New View of the Functions of Imitation and Benevolence''" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RuNXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA369#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol.1, No.4, (January 1844), pp.369\u2013385]); "''On the Situation of the Organ of Amativeness''" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cuNXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol.2, No.6, (July 1844), pp.186\u2013189]); and "''A Theory concerning the Organ of Wonder''" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cuNXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA316#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol.2, No.7, (October 1844), pp.316\u2013325]).</ref>\u000a\u000a[[Image:Herbert Spencer 5.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Spencer]]\u000a\u000aSpencer argued that both these theories were partial accounts of the truth: repeated associations of ideas were embodied in the formation of specific strands of brain tissue, and these could be passed from one generation to the next by means of the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] mechanism of use-inheritance. The ''Psychology'', he believed, would do for the human mind what [[Isaac Newton]] had done for matter.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' p. 75</ref> However, the book was not initially successful and the last of the 251 copies of its first edition was not sold until June 1861.\u000a\u000aSpencer's interest in psychology derived from a more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' p. 537</ref> In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed with the idea of demonstrating that it was possible to show that everything in the universe \u2013 including human culture, language, and morality \u2013 could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's ''Système de Philosophie Positive'' had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution.\u000a\u000aIn 1858 Spencer produced an outline of what was to become the System of Synthetic Philosophy. This immense undertaking, which has few parallels in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the principle of evolution applied in biology, psychology, sociology (Spencer appropriated Comte's term for the new discipline) and morality. Spencer envisaged that this work of ten volumes would take twenty years to complete; in the end it took him twice as long and consumed almost all the rest of his long life.\u000a\u000aDespite Spencer's early struggles to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become the most famous philosopher of the age.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' p. 497</ref> His works were widely read during his lifetime, and by 1869 he was able to support himself solely on the profit of book sales and on income from his regular contributions to Victorian periodicals which were collected as three volumes of ''Essays''. His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and into many other languages and he was offered honours and awards all over Europe and North America. He also became a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]], an exclusive Gentleman's Club in London open only to those distinguished in the arts and sciences, and the [[X Club]], a dining club of nine founded by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] that met every month and included some of the most prominent thinkers of the Victorian age (three of whom would become presidents of the [[Royal Society]]).\u000a\u000aMembers included physicist-philosopher [[John Tyndall]] and Darwin's cousin, the banker and biologist [[Sir John Lubbock]]. There were also some quite significant satellites such as liberal clergyman [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|Arthur Stanley]], the Dean of Westminster; and guests such as Charles Darwin and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] were entertained from time to time. Through such associations, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to secure an influential audience for his views. Despite his growing wealth and fame he never owned a house of his own.\u000a\u000aThe last decades of Spencer's life were characterised by growing disillusionment and loneliness. He never married, and after 1855 was a perpetual hypochondriac who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By the 1890s his readership had begun to desert him while many of his closest friends died and he had come to doubt the confident faith in progress that he had made the center-piece of his philosophical system. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Whereas ''Social Statics'' had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the [[Liberty and Property Defence League]] against what they saw as the drift towards 'socialism' of elements (such as Sir William Harcourt) within the administration of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] \u2013 largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself. Spencer's political views from this period were expressed in what has become his most famous work, ''[[The Man vs the state|The Man versus the state]].''\u000a\u000a[[Image:Spencer Herbert grave.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Tomb of Herbert Spencer in [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]\u000a\u000aThe exception to Spencer's growing conservativism was that he remained throughout his life an ardent [[Anti-imperialism|opponent of imperialism]] and [[Anti-militarism|militarism]]. His critique of the [[Boer War]] was especially scathing, and it contributed to his declining popularity in Britain.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' p. 464</ref>\u000a\u000aSpencer also invented a precursor to the modern [[paper clip]], though it looked more like a modern [[Cotter pin (disambiguation)|cotter pin]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2015}}. This "binding-pin" was distributed by Ackermann & Company. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses.\u000a\u000aIn 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize for literature]]. He continued writing all his life, in later years often by dictation, until he succumbed to poor health at the age of 83. His ashes are interred in the eastern side of London's [[Highgate Cemetery]] facing [[Karl Marx]]'s grave. At Spencer's funeral the Indian nationalist leader [[Shyamji Krishnavarma]] announced a donation of £1,000 to establish a lectureship at [[Oxford University]] in tribute to Spencer and his work.<ref>Duncan, ''Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer,'' p. 537</ref>\u000a\u000a==Synthetic philosophy<!--'Synthetic philosophy' redirects here-->==\u000aThe basis for Spencer's appeal to many of his generation was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith at a time when orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science. Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in the ultimate perfection of humanity on the basis of advanced scientific conceptions such as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and [[biological evolution]].\u000a\u000aIn essence Spencer's philosophical vision was formed by a combination of [[deism]] and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society and from books like [[George Combe]]'s immensely popular ''The Constitution of Man'' (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost sub-conscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy.\u000a\u000aSpencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held that it was possible to discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's ''Constitution of Man''.\u000a\u000aThe second objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was to show that these same laws led inexorably to progress. In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge in the form of the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution. In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] in his anonymous ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' (1844). Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', Chambers' book was in reality a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that [[Laplace]]'s [[nebular hypothesis]] for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances (in Lewes' phrase) of 'one magnificent generalisation of progressive development.' Chambers was associated with Chapman's salon and his work served as the unacknowledged template for the Synthetic Philosophy.\u000a\u000a==Evolution==\u000aSpencer first articulated his evolutionary perspective in his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's ''[[Westminster Review]]'' in 1857, and which later formed the basis of the ''First Principles of a New System of Philosophy'' (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s essay 'The Theory of Life' \u2013 itself derivative from [[Friedrich von Schelling]]'s [[Naturphilosophie]] \u2013 with a generalisation of [[Karl Ernst von Baer|von Baer]]'s law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, while being accompanied by a process of greater integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process could be found at work, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It was a universal law, that was applying to the stars and the galaxies as much as to biological organisms, and to human social organisation as much as to the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only by its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences could be shown to be illustrations of this principle.\u000a\u000aHowever, as [[Bertrand Russell]] stated in a letter to [[Beatrice Webb]] in 1923, this formulation has problems: 'I don't know whether [Spencer] was ever made to realise the implications of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]; if so, he may well be upset. The law says that everything tends to uniformity and a dead level, diminishing (not increasing) heterogeneity'.<ref>\u000aquoted in {{cite book|first=Kieran |last=Egan|title=Getting it wrong from the beginning|authorlink=Kieran Egan (educationist)|url=http://www.sfu.ca/~egan/Wrong-article.html|year=2002|accessdate=14 June 2013}}\u000a</ref>\u000a\u000aSpencer's attempt to explain the [[evolution of complexity]] was radically different from that to be found in Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin's work on [[natural selection]]. But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase '[[survival of the fittest]]' as his own term for Darwin's concept,<ref name=sotf/> and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism was also necessary to explain 'higher' evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution had a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society was the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man's mind had evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. Intuition, or knowledge learned unconsciously, was the inherited experience of the race.\u000a\u000aSpencer in his book ''Principles of Biology'' (1864), proposed a [[pangenesis]] theory that involved "physiological units". These hypothetical hereditary units were similar to Darwin's [[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]].<ref>Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. pp. 41-42. ISBN 978-90-481-9901-3</ref>\u000a\u000a==Sociology==\u000a[[Image:Herbert Spencer 4.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Spencer]]\u000aSpencer read with excitement the original [[positivist]] sociology of [[Auguste Comte]]. A [[philosopher of science]], Comte had proposed a theory of [[sociocultural evolution]] that society progresses by a general [[law of three stages]]. Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Given the primacy with which Spencer placed on evolution in his work, Spencer's sociology might be described as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] (though strictly speaking he was a proponent of [[Lamarckism]] rather than Darwinism).  Despite the popularity of this view, such a description of Spencer's sociology is mistaken.  While Spencer's political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are not present in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on building a theory regarding how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing amounts of complexity amongst the various forms of social organization <ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Jonathan H.|title=Herbert Spencer|date=1985|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA|isbn=0-8039-2244-2}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThe evolutionary progression from simple, undifferentiated homogeneity to complex, differentiated heterogeneity was exemplified, Spencer argued, by the development of society. He developed a theory of two types of society, the militant and the industrial, which corresponded to this evolutionary progression. Militant society, structured around relationships of hierarchy and obedience, was simple and undifferentiated; industrial society, based on voluntary, contractually assumed social obligations, was complex and differentiated. Society, which Spencer conceptualised as a '[[social organism]]' evolved from the simpler state to the more complex according to the universal law of evolution. Moreover, industrial society was the direct descendant of the ideal society developed in ''Social Statics'', although Spencer now equivocated over whether the evolution of society would result in anarchism (as he had first believed) or whether it pointed to a continued role for the state, albeit one reduced to the minimal functions of the enforcement of contracts and external defence.\u000a\u000aThough Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not least in his influence on [[structural functionalism]], his attempt to introduce Lamarckian or Darwinian ideas into the realm of sociology was unsuccessful. It was considered by many, furthermore, to be actively dangerous. [[Hermeneutic]]ians of the period, such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], would pioneer the distinction between the natural sciences (''Naturwissenschaften'') and human sciences (''[[Geisteswissenschaften]]''). In the United States, the sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]], who would be elected as the first president of the [[American Sociological Association]], launched a relentless attack on Spencer's theories of laissez-faire and political ethics. Although Ward admired much of Spencer's work he believed that Spencer's prior political biases had distorted his thought and had led him astray.<ref>[[s:Page:Popular Science Monthly Volume 44.djvu/874|''Popular Science Monthly'', Volume 44]]</ref> In the 1890s, [[Émile Durkheim]] established formal academic sociology with a firm emphasis on practical [[social research]].  By the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists, most notably [[Max Weber]], had presented methodological [[antipositivism]]. However, it should be noted that Spencer's theories of laissez-faire, survival-of-the-fittest and minimal human interference in the processes of natural law had an enduring and even increasing appeal in the social science fields of economics and political science, and one writer has recently made the case for Spencer's importance for a sociology that must learn to take energy in society seriously.<ref>McKinnon, AM. (2010). 'Energy and society: Herbert Spencer\u2019s \u2018energetic sociology\u2019 of social evolution and beyond'. Journal of Classical Sociology, vol 10, no. 4, pp. 439-455.

He rejected theology as representing the 'impiety of the pious.' He was to gain much notoriety from his repudiation of traditional religion, and was frequently condemned by religious thinkers for allegedly advocating atheism and materialism. Nonetheless, unlike [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], whose agnosticism was a militant creed directed at 'the unpardonable sin of faith' (in [[Adrian Desmond]]'s phrase), Spencer insisted that he was not concerned to undermine religion in the name of science, but to bring about a reconciliation of the two.\u000a\u000aStarting either from religious belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether we are concerned with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, he thought that the Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.\u000a\u000a==Political views==\u000a{{liberalism sidebar}}\u000a{{libertarianism sidebar}}\u000aSpencerian views in 21st century circulation derive from his political theories and memorable attacks on the reform movements of the late 19th century. He has been claimed as a precursor by [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarcho-capitalists]]. Economist [[Murray Rothbard]] called ''Social Statics'' "the greatest single work of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political philosophy ever written."<ref>[[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Doherty, Brian]], ''[[Radicals for Capitalism|Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement]]'', p. 246.</ref> Spencer argued that the state was not an "essential" institution and that it would "decay" as voluntary market organisation would replace the coercive aspects of the state.<ref>Stringham, Edward. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768172 ''Anarchy and the Law.''] Transaction Publishers, 2007. p. 387.</ref> He also argued that the individual had a "right to ignore the state."<ref>Stringham, Edward. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768172 ''Anarchy and the Law.''] Transaction Publishers, 2007. p. 388.</ref> As a result of this perspective, Spencer was harshly critical of patriotism. In response to being told that British troops were in danger during the [[Second Afghan War]], he replied: "When men hire themselves out to shoot other men to order, asking nothing about the justice of their cause, I don't care if they are shot themselves."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBQRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA126 Herbert Spencer, ''Facts and comments''], p. 126.</ref>\u000a\u000aPolitics in late Victorian Britain moved in directions that Spencer disliked, and his arguments provided much ammunition for conservatives and individualists in Europe and America that they still are in use in the 21st century. The expression '[[There Is No Alternative]]' (TINA), made famous by Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer.<ref>''Social Statics'' (1851), pp. 42, 307.</ref>\u000a\u000aBy the 1880s he was denouncing "the new Toryism" (that is, the "social reformist wing" of the Liberal party \u2013 the wing to some extent hostile to Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], this faction of the Liberal party Spencer compared to the interventionist "Toryism" of such people as the former Conservative party Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]). In ''[[The Man vs the state|The Man versus the State]]'' (1884),<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/hs/manvssta.htm The Man vs the State, 1884] at the Constitution Society</ref> he attacked Gladstone and the Liberal party for losing its proper mission (they should be defending personal liberty, he said) and instead promoting paternalist social legislation (what Gladstone himself called "Construction" \u2013 an element in the modern Liberal party that he opposed). Spencer denounced Irish land reform, compulsory education, laws to regulate safety at work, prohibition and temperance laws, tax funded libraries, and welfare reforms. His main objections were threefold: the use of the coercive powers of the government, the discouragement given to voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of the "laws of life." The reforms, he said, were tantamount to "socialism", which he said was about the same as "slavery" in terms of limiting human freedom. Spencer vehemently attacked the widespread enthusiasm for annexation of colonies and imperial expansion, which subverted all he had predicted about evolutionary progress from 'militant' to 'industrial' societies and states.<ref>Ronald F. Cooney, "Herbert Spencer: Apostle of Liberty" ''Freeman'' (January 1973)[http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/herbert-spencer-apostle-of-liberty/ online]</ref>\u000a\u000aSpencer anticipated many of the analytical standpoints of later libertarian theorists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]], especially in his "law of equal liberty", his insistence on the limits to predictive knowledge, his model of a spontaneous social order, and his warnings about the "unintended consequences" of collectivist social reforms.<ref>Chris Matthew Sciabarra, "Libertarianism", in ''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology,'' ed.

He came to predict that social welfare programmes would eventually lead to socialisation of the means of production, saying "all socialism is slavery"; Spencer defined a slave as a person who "labours under coercion to satisfy another's desires" and believed that under socialism or communism the individual would be enslaved to the whole community rather than to a particular master, and "it means not whether his master a single person or society"\u000a\u000a===Social Darwinism===\u000aFor many, the name of Herbert Spencer would be virtually synonymous with [[Social Darwinism]], a social theory that applies the law of the survival of the fittest to society; humanitarian impulses had to be resisted as nothing should be allowed to interfere with nature's laws, including the social struggle for existence.\u000a\u000aSpencer's association with [[Social Darwinism]] might have its origin in a specific interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result in the death of a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable support themselves without charity.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Offer |title=An Intellectual History of British Social Policy |location=Bristol |publisher=Policy Press |year=2006 |pages=38, 142 |isbn=1-86134-530-5 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aFocusing on the form as well as the content of Spencer's "Synthetic Philosophy", one writer has identified it as the paradigmatic case of "Social Darwinism", understood as a politically motivated metaphysic very different in both form and motivation from Darwinist science.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Iain |last=Stewart |title=Commandeering Time: The Ideological Status of Time in the Social Darwinism of Herbert Spencer |year=2011 |volume=57 |journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History |issue=3 |pages=389\u2013402 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8497.2011.01604.x }}</ref>\u000a\u000a==General influence==\u000aWhile most philosophers fail to achieve much of a following outside the academy of their professional peers, by the 1870s and 1880s Spencer had achieved an unparalleled popularity, as the sheer volume of his sales indicate. He was probably the first, and possibly the only, philosopher in history to sell over a million copies of his works during his own lifetime. In the United States, where pirated editions were still commonplace, his authorised publisher, Appleton, sold 368,755 copies between 1860 and 1903. This figure did not differ much from his sales in his native Britain, and once editions in the rest of the world are added in the figure of a million copies seems like a conservative estimate. As [[William James]] remarked, Spencer "enlarged the imagination, and set free the speculative mind of countless doctors, engineers, and lawyers, of many physicists and chemists, and of thoughtful laymen generally."<ref>James, William. "Herbert Spencer". ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Vol. XCIV (1904), p. 104.</ref> The aspect of his thought that emphasised individual self-improvement found a ready audience in the skilled working class.\u000a\u000aSpencer's influence among leaders of thought was also immense, though it was most often expressed in terms of their reaction to, and repudiation of, his ideas. As his American follower [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] observed, Spencer's ideas were to be found "running like the weft through all the warp" of Victorian thought.<ref>Quoted in John Offer, ''Herbert Spencer: Critical Assessments'' (London: Routledge, 2004), p. 612.</ref> Such varied thinkers as [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[T.H. Green]], [[G.E. Moore]], [[William James]], [[Henri Bergson]], and [[Émile Durkheim]] defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's ''Division of Labour in Society'' is to a very large extent an extended debate with Spencer, from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert G. |last=Perrin |year=1995 |title=Émile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer |journal=Sociological Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=791\u2013808 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1995.tb00465.x }}</ref>\u000a\u000a[[File:Herbert Spencer by John McLure Hamilton.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Spencer by [[John McLure Hamilton|Hamilton]], ca. 1895]]\u000a\u000aIn post-[[January Uprising|1863-Uprising]] [[Poland]], many of Spencer's ideas became integral to the dominant ''[[fin de siècle|fin-de-siècle]]'' ideology, "[[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]". The leading Polish writer of the period, [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]], hailed Spencer as "the [[Aristotle]] of the nineteenth century" and adopted Spencer's [[metaphor]] of society-as-organism, giving it a striking poetic presentation in his 1884 [[flash fiction|micro-story]], "[[Mold of the Earth]]", and highlighting the concept in the introduction to his most universal novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895).\u000a\u000aThe early 20th century was hostile to Spencer. Soon after his death, his philosophical reputation went into a sharp decline. Half a century after his death, his work was dismissed as a "parody of philosophy",<ref>Gertrude Himmelfarb, ''[[Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution]]'', 1968, p. 222; quoted in Robert J. Richards, ''Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), p. 243.</ref> and the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] called him "the metaphysician of the homemade intellectual, and the prophet of the cracker-barrel agnostic."<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' (1944; Boston: Beacon Press, 1992), p. 32.</ref> Nonetheless, Spencer's thought had penetrated so deeply into the Victorian age that his influence did not disappear entirely.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, much more positive estimates have appeared,<ref>Mark Francis, ''Herbert Spencer and the Invention of Modern Life'' (Newcastle, UK: Acumen Publishing, 2007).</ref> as well as a still highly negative estimate.<ref name=Stewart>Stewart (2011).</ref>\u000a\u000a===Political influence===\u000aDespite his reputation as a Social Darwinist, Spencer's political thought has been open to multiple interpretations. His political philosophy could both provide inspiration to those who believed that individuals were masters of their fate, who should brook no interference from a meddling state, and those who believed that social development required a strong central authority. In ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', conservative justices of the [[United States Supreme Court]] could find inspiration in Spencer's writings for striking down a New York law limiting the number of hours a baker could work during the week, on the ground that this law restricted [[liberty]] of contract. Arguing against the majority's holding that a "right to free contract" is implicit in the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] wrote: "The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics." Spencer has also been described as a quasi-[[anarchism|anarchist]], as well as an outright anarchist. [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorist [[Georgi Plekhanov]], in his 1909 book ''Anarchism and Socialism'', labelled Spencer a "conservative Anarchist."<ref>Plekhanov, Georgi\u012d Valentinovich (1912), trans. Aveling, Eleanor Marx. ''Anarchism and Socialism'', p. 143. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr & Company. ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/ch09.htm See here.])</ref>\u000a\u000aSpencer's ideas became very influential in China and Japan largely because he appealed to the reformers' desire to establish a strong nation-state with which to compete with the Western powers. His thought was introduced by the Chinese scholar [[Yen Fu]], who saw his writings as a prescription for the reform of the [[Qing]] [[Sovereign state|state]].<ref>Benjamin Schwartz, ''In Search of Wealth and Power'' (The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1964).</ref> Spencer also influenced the Japanese Westernizer [[Tokutomi Soho]], who believed that Japan was on the verge of transitioning from a "militant society" to an "industrial society," and needed to quickly jettison all things Japanese and take up Western ethics and learning.<ref>Kenneth Pyle, ''The New Generation in Meiji Japan'' (Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, 1969).</ref> He also corresponded with [[Kaneko Kentaro]], warning him of the dangers of imperialism.<ref>Spencer to Kaneko Kentaro, 26 August 1892 in ''The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' ed.

His 1852 essay, "The Philosophy of Style", explored a growing trend of [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] approaches to writing. Highly focused on the proper placement and ordering of the parts of an English sentence, he created a guide for effective [[composition (language)|composition]]. Spencer aimed to free [[prose]] writing from as much "[[friction]] and [[inertia]]" as possible, so that the reader would not be slowed by strenuous deliberations concerning the proper context and meaning of a sentence. Spencer argued that writers should aim "To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort" by the reader.\u000a\u000aHe argued that by making the meaning as readily accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the greatest possible communicative efficiency. This was accomplished, according to Spencer, by placing all the subordinate clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence so that, when readers reached the subject, they had all the information they needed to completely perceive its significance. While the overall influence that "The Philosophy of Style" had on the field of rhetoric was not as far-reaching as his contribution to other fields, Spencer's voice lent authoritative support to [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] views of [[rhetoric]].\u000a\u000aSpencer influenced literature inasmuch as many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. [[George Eliot]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Boles\u0142aw Prus#Journalism|Boles\u0142aw Prus]], [[Abraham Cahan]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Machado de Assis]], [[Richard Austin Freeman]], and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] all referenced Spencer. [[Arnold Bennett]] greatly praised ''First Principles'', and the influence it had on Bennett may be seen in his many novels. [[Jack London]] went so far as to create a character, ''[[Martin Eden]]'', a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested{{by whom|date=February 2016}} that the character of Vershinin in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s play ''[[The Three Sisters (play)|The Three Sisters]]'' is a dedicated Spencerian. [[H.G. Wells]] used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, ''[[The Time Machine]]'', employing them to explain the [[evolution]] of man into two [[species]]. It is perhaps the best testimony to the [[Social influence|influence]] of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s novel [[Kim (novel)|''Kim'']], the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires of Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: "They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena.  Spencer says." "I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know."
