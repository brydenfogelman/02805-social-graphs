V'''Johannes Franciscus Abraham Karel (Johan) van Benthem''' (born 12 June 1949 in [[Rijswijk]]) is a University Professor \u000a(''[[universiteitshoogleraar]]'') of [[logic]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] at the [[Institute for Logic, Language and Computation]] and [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Stanford University]] (at [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|CSLI]]). He was awarded the [[Spinozapremie]] in 1996<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/1996 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 1996 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref> and elected a Foreign Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts & Sciences]] in 2015.\u000a\u000aHe studied [[physics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] 1969), [[philosophy]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]] 1972) and [[mathematics]] ([[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] 1973) at the University of Amsterdam and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the same university under supervision of [[Martin Löb]] in 1977. Before becoming University Professor in 2003, he held appointments at the University of Amsterdam (1973\u20131977), at the [[University of Groningen]] (1977\u20131986), and as a [[professor]] at the University of Amsterdam (1986\u20132003).\u000a\u000aIn 1992 he was elected member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/3856 |title=Johan van Benthem |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>\u000a\u000aVan Benthem is known for his research in the area of [[modal logic]]. This research has resulted in [[Van Benthem's Theorem]], which states that modal logic is the fragment of [[first-order logic]] that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed under]] [[bisimulation]].\u000a\u000aHe has also been active in the fields of [[philosophy of science]], logical structures in natural language ([[generalized quantifier]]s, [[categorial grammar]], substructural [[proof theory]]), [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and [[update logic]] and applications of [[logic]] to [[game theory]] as well as applications of [[game theory]] to [[logic]] ([[game semantics]]). Van Benthem is a member of the group collectively publishing under the [[pseudonym]] [[L. T. F. Gamut]]. He has also taught in China. He made an effort to encourage and organize international collaboration between Chinese and Western logicians.\u000a\u000aProfessor van Benthem retired from the [[Institute for Logic, Language and Computation]] in  September 2014.\u000a\u000a==Publications==\u000a*''Logic in action'', North Holland, 1991\u000a*''Handbook of Logic and Language'', ed. with [[Alice ter Meulen]], [[Elsevier]]/[[MIT Press]], 1997\u000a*''Modal Logic: A Semantic Perspective'', with [[Patrick Blackburn]]\u000a*''Logic in Games'', MIT Press, January 2014\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a*[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan Van Benthem's personal homepage]\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Benthem, Johan van}}\u000a[[Category:1949 births]]\u000a[[Category:Living people]]\u000a[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\u000a[[Category:Dutch philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Dutch logicians]]\u000a[[Category:Logicians]]\u000a[[Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\u000a[[Category:People from Rijswijk]]\u000a[[Category:Stanford University Department of Philosophy faculty]]\u000a[[Category:Spinoza Prize winners]]\u000a[[Category:University of Amsterdam faculty]]\u000a[[Category:University of Amsterdam alumni]]\u000a[[Category:University of Groningen faculty]]\u000a[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Tarski lecturers]]\u000a\u000a\u000a{{Netherlands-philosopher-stub}}\u000a{{Netherlands-scientist-stub}}\u000a{{Europe-mathematician-stub}}
