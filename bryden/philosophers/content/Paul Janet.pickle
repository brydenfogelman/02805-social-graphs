V[[File:Paul Janet.jpg|thumb|Paul Janet]]\u000a'''Paul Alexandre René Janet''' (30 April 1823 \u2013 4 October 1899) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and writer.\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aBorn in [[Paris, France|Paris]], he became professor of [[moral philosophy]] at [[Bourges]] (1845\u20131848) and [[Strasbourg]] (1848\u20131857), and of logic at the ''lycée Louis-le-Grand'', Paris (1857\u20131864). In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.\u000a\u000aHe wrote widely on philosophy, politics and ethics, on idealistic lines: ''La Famille'', ''Histoire de la philosophie dans l'antiquité et dans le temps moderne'', ''Histoire de la science politique'', ''Philosophie de la Revolution Française'', etc. However, in the opinion of [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of [[Victor Cousin]], and through him of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. His principal work, ''Théorie de la morale'', owes much to [[Immanuel Kant]].\u000a\u000a=== Works ===\u000a*The Materialism of the Present Day, a Critique of Dr. Büchner's System ISBN 1152057863\u000a\u000a==Notes==\u000a{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\u000a{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{Wikisource author}}\u000a* {{EB1911|wstitle=Janet, Paul}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a* {{Gutenberg author | id=Janet,+Paul | name=Paul Janet}}\u000a* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Paul Janet}}\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Janet, Paul}}\u000a[[Category:1823 births]]\u000a[[Category:1899 deaths]]\u000a[[Category:University of Bourges faculty]]\u000a[[Category:University of Strasbourg faculty]]\u000a[[Category:University of Paris faculty]]\u000a[[Category:French philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:French essayists]]\u000a[[Category:École Normale Supérieure alumni]]\u000a[[Category:French male writers]]\u000a[[Category:Male essayists]]
