He is a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and is known for his work in [[group theory]], especially on the [[Burnside's problem|Burnside problem]].\u000a\u000a==Biography==\u000aAdian was born near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Elizavetpol]]. He grew up there in an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family. He studied at [[Yerevan]] and [[Moscow]] [[pedagogical]] institutes. \u000aHis advisor was [[Pyotr Novikov]]. He has been working at Moscow State University since 1965. [[Alexander Razborov]] was one of his students.\u000a\u000a==Mathematical career==\u000aIn his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function f(x) of a real variable satisfying\u000athe functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) and having discontinuities is\u000adense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear\u000afunctions.) This result was not published at the time. It is curious that about\u000a25 years later the American mathematician [[Edwin Hewitt]] from Seattle gave\u000apreprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which\u000awas devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much\u000alater.\u000a\u000aBy the beginning of 1955 Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial\u000ainvariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a\u000afixed group G, for any group G. These results made up his Ph.D. thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most\u000aremarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the [[Adian\u2013Rabin theorem]].\u000aWhat distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody\u000ahas added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian\u2019s result was immediately used by A. A. Markov in\u000ahis proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic.\u000a\u000a===Burnside problem===\u000a\u000aAbout the Burnside problem:\u000a<blockquote>\u000aVery much like Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem in number theory, Burnside\u2019s\u000aproblem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination\u000aexerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which\u000athen turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about\u000ait to the mind of the mathematician.\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000aBefore the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for n 2 {2, 3, 4, 6} and the matrix groups.\u000aHowever, this did not\u000ahinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period n. The only question was\u000ato find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief\u000awas too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came\u000aclose to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which\u000asubtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact,\u000athere were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the\u000aform X^n = 1.\u000a\u000aAn approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by\u000aP. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete\u000arealization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence\u000aof Novikov and his wife Lyudmila Keldysh, Adian settled down to work on\u000athe Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both\u000acollaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper\u000aappeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods\u000an > 4381, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well.\u000a\u000aThe solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding\u000aand deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result\u000ais one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction\u000aused in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened\u000aby 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by\u000athe exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words\u000aof Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more \u2018penetrating\u2019\u000athan Adian.\u000a\u000aIn contrast to the Adian\u2013Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way \u2018closed\u2019 the Burnside problem. Moreover,\u000aover a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify\u000athe method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other\u000afundamental problems in group theory.\u000a\u000aBy the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors\u000aappeared who mastered the Novikov\u2013Adian method, the theory already\u000arepresented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both\u000aperiodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a* {{ru icon}} ''[http://www.mi.ras.ru/~razborov/adian75.pdf On 75th birthday]'' \u2013 an article by L.
