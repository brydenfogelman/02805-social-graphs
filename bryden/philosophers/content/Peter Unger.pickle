Unger''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u028c|\u014b|\u0259r}}; born April 25, 1942) is a contemporary American [[philosopher]] and professor at [[New York University]]. His main interests lie in the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], and the [[philosophy of mind]]. He attended [[Swarthmore College]] at the same time as [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], earning a B.A. in philosophy in 1962,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x10310.xml |title=Swarthmore College :: Philosophy :: Department Alumni with PHIL Ph.D.s |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=Swarthmore College |year=2009 }}</ref> and [[Oxford University]], where he studied under [[A.

Ayer]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2001/11/19/Thinking-about-life-Peter-Unger/UPI-99161006217214/ |title=UPI Article: Thinking about life: Peter Unger |accessdate=2011-12-12 |publisher=[[UPI]] |year=2001 }}</ref> and earned a doctorate in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/peterunger |title=NYU > Philosophy > Unger, Peter |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=New York University |date= }}</ref>\u000a\u000aUnger has written a defense of profound [[philosophical skepticism]]. In ''Ignorance'' (1975), he argues that nobody knows anything and even that nobody is reasonable or justified in believing anything.\u000a\u000aIn ''Philosophical Relativity'' (1984), he argues that many philosophical questions cannot be definitively answered.\u000a\u000aIn the field of applied ethics, his best-known work is ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (1996). In this text, Unger argues that the citizens of first-world countries have a [[moral obligation|moral duty]] to make large donations to life-saving charities (such as [[Oxfam]] and [[UNICEF]]), and that once they have given all of their own money and possessions, beyond what is needed to survive, they should give what belongs to others, even if having to beg, borrow, or steal in the process.\u000a\u000aIn "The Mental Problems of the Many" (2002), he argues for Substantial Interactionist Dualism on questions of mind and matter: that each of us is an immaterial soul.   The argument is extended and fortified in his 2006 book ''All the Power in the World''.\u000a\u000aIn ''Empty Ideas'' (2014), he argues that analytic philosophy has delivered no substantial results as to how things are with concrete reality.\u000a\u000a==Selected publications==\u000a\u000a===Books===\u000a\u000a* ''Ignorance: A Case for Scepticism'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1975 and 2002) ISBN 0-19-824417-7\u000a*''Philosophical Relativity'' (Blackwell and Minnesota, 1984; Oxford, 2002) ISBN 0-19-515553-X\u000a* ''Identity, Consciousness and Value'' (Oxford, 1990) ISBN 0-19-507917-5\u000a* ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]: Our Illusion of Innocence'' (Oxford, 1996) ISBN 0-19-510859-0\u000a* ''All the Power in the World'' (Oxford, 2006) ISBN 0-19-515561-0\u000a* ''Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (Oxford, 2006) ISBN 0-19-515552-1\u000a* ''Philosophical Papers, Volume 2'' (Oxford, 2006) ISBN 0-19-530158-7\u000a* ''Empty Ideas: A Critique of Analytic Philosophy '' (Oxford, 2014) ISBN 978-0-19933081-2\u000a\u000a===Articles===\u000a* \u201cAn Analysis of Factual Knowledge,\u201d ''The Journal of Philosophy'', LXV (1968): 157-170\u000a* \u201cA Defense of Skepticism,\u201d ''The Philosophical Review'', LXXX (1971): 198-219.\u000a* \u201cThe Uniqueness in Causation,\u201d ''American Philosophical Quarterly'', 14 (1977): 177-188.  \u000a* \u201cThere Are No Ordinary Things,\u201d ''Synthese'', 41 (1979): 117-154.\u000a* "I do not Exist", in ''Perception and Identity'', G.
