He died in February 2010 in Belgrade, [[Serbia]].\u000a\u000a==Early life==\u000aMarkovi\u0107 was born in [[Belgrade]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. He became a member of the youth organization of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan]] he actively participated in the struggle for [[liberation of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]].\u000a\u000a==Academic career==\u000aMarkovi\u0107 took a doctorate in philosophy first at the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in 1955, and then another in 1956 at [[University College London]]. There he studied [[logic]] under [[A. J. Ayer]], and wrote his thesis on ''The Concept of Logic''. In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966\u20131967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972\u201380 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Markovi\u0107 was a co-Chairman of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (1975\u20131985). He has been a corresponding member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] since 1963 and a full member since 1983.\u000a\u000aIn his honour, a collection of articles entitled ''Philosophy and Society'' was published in Belgrade in 1987.\u000a\u000a==Social critic==\u000aAfter the Resolution of the [[Informbiro]] condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Markovi\u0107 took part in a fierce debate against [[Stalinist]] dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His ''Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR'', published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia.\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s Markovi\u0107 became a major proponent of the [[Praxis School]] of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal ''Praxis''. Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Markovi\u0107 was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Markovi\u0107 worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986.\u000a\u000aAs a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Markovi\u0107, together with [[Vasilije Kresti\u0107]] and others, wrote the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SANU Memorandum]], a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation.\u000a\u000a==Socialist Party of Serbia==\u000aMarkovi\u0107 was vice-president of the [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue.

In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party.<ref>[http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0353-5738/2010/0353-57381001003M.pdf ''Praxis \u2013 critical thinking and acting'', 2009 interview with Mihailo Markovi\u0107] (in Serbian)</ref>\u000a\u000a==Bibliography==\u000a* ''Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR'' (1952)\u000a* ''Logic'' (1956)\u000a* ''Formalism in Contemporary Logic'' (1957)\u000a* ''Dialectical Theory of Meaning'', Belgrade 1961\u000a* ''Humanism and Dialectics'' (1967)\u000a* ''Dialektik der Praxis'', '' Humanizm i djalektika'', Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1968\u000a* ''Att utveckla socialismen'', Stockholm, 1971\u000a* ''From Affluence to Praxis (Philosophy and social criticism)'', Ann Arbor, 1974\u000a* ''The Contemporary Marx'', Nottingham, 1974\u000a* ''Philosophical Foundations of Science'', Belgrade 1982\u000a* ''Selected Works in eight volumes'', Belgrade, 1994\u000a* ''Freedom and Praxis'', Belgrade 1997\u000a* ''Social Thought at the Border of Milenia'', 1999\u000a* ''Storming the Sky: Memoirs'', 2008\u000a\u000a==See also==\u000a* [[Simo Elakovi\u0107]]\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a==External links==\u000a\u000a{{commons category|Mihailo Markovi\u0107}}\u000a* [http://www.marxists.org/archive/markovic/index.htm Mihailo Markovi\u0107 Archive]\u000a* [http://praxis.anarhija.org/index.php/Praxis:Praxis_1969_1-2:Pojam_revolucije_-_Mihailo_Markovi%C4%87 ''The Notion of Revolution'' (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://praxis.anarhija.org/index.php/Praxis:Praxis_1973_1-2:Jednakost_i_sloboda_-_Mihailo_Markovi%C4%87 ''Equality and Freedom'' (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://www.socioloskipregled.org.rs/Tekstovi/2(1994)/Markovic_Mihailo.pdf ''The Causes of breaking up of Yugoslavia'' (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://www.komunikacija.org.rs/komunikacija/casopisi/fid/XXI/d03/html_ser_lat ''Reason and Ethos'' (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2005-07-08-eriksen-en.html ''The Memorandum: Roots of Serbian nationalism'': an interview with Mihailo Markovi\u0107 and Vasilije Kresti\u0107]\u000a* [http://archive.serbianunity.net/kosta/memorandum/title.html Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts: Answer to the Criticisms]\u000a* [http://147.91.230.48/ifdt/saradnici/MarkovicM/s_index?stdlang=sr Biography and Bibliography of Markovi\u0107 (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://www.nin.co.rs/1999-12/23/10898.html 1999 ''NIN'' article about Mihailo Markovi\u0107 and the Praxis School (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://teme.junis.ni.ac.rs/teme3-2002/teme3-2002-10.pdf ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'' \u2013 an interview with Mihailo Markovic (in Serbian)]\u000a* [http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/26/world/a-sort-of-super-serb-defends-serbian-policy.html ''A sort of super-Serb defends Serbian policy'' \u2013 an interview with Markovic (in English)]\u000a* [http://www.iacenter.org/bosnia/yugo_markovic.htm ''A Counter-revolution, and not all that velvety'' \u2013 an interview with Markovic (in English)]\u000a* [http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Kulturni-dodatak/Filozofija-koja-se-zivi.lt.html ''Philosophy that is Lived'' \u2013 a tribute to Markovic (in Serbian)]\u000a\u000a{{Authority control}}\u000a\u000a{{DEFAULTSORT:Markovic, Mihailo}}\u000a[[Category:1923 births]]\u000a[[Category:2010 deaths]]\u000a[[Category:20th-century Serbian people]]\u000a[[Category:People from Belgrade]]\u000a[[Category:Yugoslav Partisans members]]\u000a[[Category:Serbian writers]]\u000a[[Category:Serbian atheists]]\u000a[[Category:Scholars of Marxism]]\u000a[[Category:Social philosophy]]\u000a[[Category:Serbian philosophers]]\u000a[[Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\u000a[[Category:Members of the Association of Writers of Serbia]]\u000a[[Category:University of Belgrade faculty]]\u000a[[Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy alumni]]\u000a[[Category:Alumni of University College London]]\u000a[[Category:League of Communists of Serbia politicians]]\u000a[[Category:Socialist Party of Serbia politicians]]\u000a[[Category:Serbian humanists]]
