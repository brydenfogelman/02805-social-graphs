He also developed what is now called the "Rosser sieve", in [[number theory]]. He was later director of the Army Mathematics Research Center at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. Rosser also authored mathematical textbooks.\u000a\u000aIn 1936, he proved [[Rosser's trick]], a stronger version of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]] which shows that the requirement for [[\u03c9-consistency]] may be weakened to consistency.  Rather than using the [[liar paradox]] sentence equivalent to "I am not provable," he used a sentence that stated "For every proof of me, there is a shorter proof of my negation".\u000a\u000aIn prime number theory, he proved [[Rosser's theorem]].\u000a\u000aThe [[Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox]] showed that the original lambda calculus was inconsistent.\u000a\u000aRosser died of an [[aneurysm]] September 5, 1989, at his home in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1212612.html |title=Deaths |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=September 19, 1989 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/news/rosser.memorial.pdf |title=Memorial Resolution on the Death of Emeritus Professor J.
