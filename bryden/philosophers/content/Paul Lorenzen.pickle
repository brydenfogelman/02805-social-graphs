He became pupil of Krull in [[University of Bonn]]. His main work was on the foundations of [[mathematics]], in [[proof theory]]. He created and modified [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. Lorenzen taught at Stanford, the University of Texas, and Boston University in the USA. He was [[John Locke Lectures|John Locke Lecturer\u000a]] in 1967/1968.\u000a\u000a==Theory==\u000aLorenzen came in 1962 to [[University of Erlangen]] (South Germany) and founded the [[Erlangen School of constructivism|Erlangen School]] of [[epistemological constructivism]] there.\u000a\u000aHe wrote with Kamlah the famous book ''Logical Propaedeutic'' ("Logische Propädeutik") and worked on [[game semantics]] (''Dialogische Logik'') with ''Kuno Lorenz''. With [[Peter Janich]] he invented ''protophysics'' of time and space. He developed [[constructive logic]], [[constructive type theory]] and [[constructive analysis]].\u000a\u000aLorenzen's work on calculus ''Differential and Integral'' was dedicated to [[Hermann Weyl]]. Lorenzen used Weyl's technique to develop a [[impredicativity|predicative]] analysis, which can reconstruct [[classical analysis]], without the [[principle of excluded middle]] or the [[Axiom of Choice]]. He worked also on [[Gerhard Gentzen]]'s [[cut elimination]] to find a way to continue [[Hilbert program#Hilbert.27s program after G.C3.B6del|Hilbert's program after the results of Gödel]].\u000a\u000aIn the theory of geometry and physics, Lorenzen was influenced by [[Hugo Dingler]]. He followed Dingler in building up geometry and physics out of primitive operations. Lorenzen took an early interpretation of [[Steven Weinberg]] (Gravitation and Cosmology, 1972) for his doubts about geometrical elements of [[general relativity]], believing that [[Maxwell's equations]] are to be modified by general relativity instate.\u000a\u000aLorenzen was also influenced by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s [[hermeneutics]], and liked to quote Dilthey's saying that knowledge cannot go behind life. Dilthey's ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' was the description of the setting in ordinary experience in which we construct the abstractions of mathematics and physics.\u000a\u000aAs [[John Locke Lectures|John Locke Lecturer]] he invented normative Logic as a base on [[ethics]] and political argumentation.\u000a\u000a==Major works==\u000a* Paul Lorenzen, Frederick J.
