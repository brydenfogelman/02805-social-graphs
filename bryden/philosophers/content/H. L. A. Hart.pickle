L. A. Hart''', was a British [[Jurisprudence|legal philosopher]], and a major figure in political and legal philosophy. He was [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Professor of Jurisprudence]] at [[Oxford University]] and the Principal of [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]], Oxford. His most famous work is ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' (1961; 3rd edition, 2012). He is considered one of the world's foremost legal philosophers in the twentieth century, alongside [[Hans Kelsen]].<ref>[[Matthew Kramer|Matthew H. Kramer]] and Claire Grant (2008).

His father was a prosperous [[Jew]]ish tailor of German and Polish origin; his mother, of Polish origin, daughter of successful retailers in the clothing trade, handled customer relations and the finances of their firm. Hart had an elder brother, Albert, and a younger sister, Sybil.\u000a\u000aHart was educated at [[Cheltenham College]], [[Bradford Grammar School]] and at [[New College, Oxford]]. Hart took a Congratulatory First in [[Literae Humaniores|Classical Greats]] in 1929.<ref name="Sugarman">{{cite journal |last1= Sugarman|first1= David|last2= Hart|first2= H. L.

He was good friends with [[Richard Wilberforce|Richard (later Lord) Wilberforce]], [[Douglas Jay, Baron Jay|Douglas Jay]], and Christopher Cox, among others. He received a Harmsworth Scholarship to the [[Middle Temple]] and also wrote literary journalism for the periodical ''[[John O'London's Weekly]]''.<ref name="Sugarman" />\u000a\u000aDuring [[World War II]], Hart worked with [[MI5]], a division of British military intelligence concerned with unearthing spies who had penetrated Britain, where he renewed Oxford friendships including working with the philosophers [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[Stuart Hampshire]]. He worked closely with [[Dick White]], later head of MI5 and then of [[MI6]]. He worked at [[Bletchley Park]] and was a colleague of the mathematician and codebreaker [[Alan Turing]].<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X_KOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37 | title=Defending the Genetic Supermarket: The Law and Ethics of Selecting the Next Generation | series=Biomedical Law and Ethics Library | first=Colin | last=Gavaghan | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-1135392932 | page=37 }}</ref> Shortly after the War in [[Europe]] had ended, he and White were joined in conversation by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], a conversation which revolved around what had happened to [[Hitler]]. Trevor-Roper's biographer has written that "over the third bottle of [[hock (wine)|hock]]", the idea emerged that a systematic search should be made, a search which resulted ultimately in the historian's book ''The Last Days of Hitler''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\u000a\u000aHart's war work took him on occasion to MI5 offices at [[Blenheim Palace]], family home of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]] and the place where [[Winston Churchill]] had been born.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} There he was somehow able to read the diaries of [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]], wife of the founder of the dynasty [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]]. Hart's wit and humanity are demonstrated by the fact that he particularly enjoyed the passage where Sarah tells that John had been away for a long time, had arrived suddenly, and "enjoyed me straight way in his boots".{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}{{Relevance inline|date=August 2016}}\u000a\u000aHart did not return to his legal practice after the War, preferring instead to accept the offer of a teaching fellowship (in philosophy, not Law) at New College, Oxford. Hart cites [[J. L. Austin]] as particularly influential during this time.<ref name="Sugarman" /> The two jointly taught from 1948 a seminar on 'Legal and Moral Responsibility'. Among Hart's publications at this time were the essays 'A Logician's Fairytale', 'Is There Knowledge by Acquaintance?', 'Law and Fact' and 'The Ascription of Responsibility and Rights'.\u000a\u000aIn 1952, he was elected [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Professor of Jurisprudence]] at Oxford. It was in the summer of that year that he began writing his most famous book, ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', though it was not published until 1961. In the interim, he published another major work, ''Causation in the Law'' (with Tony Honoré) (1959). He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1959 to 1960.\u000a\u000aHart married [[Jenifer Hart|Jenifer Fischer Williams]], a civil servant, later a senior civil servant, in the Home Office and, still later, Oxford historian at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] (specialising in the history of the police).<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/Jenifer_Hart.htm Biography of Jenifer Hart]</ref> Jenifer Hart was, for some years in the mid-1930s and fading out totally by decade's end, a 'sleeper' member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Three decades later she was interviewed by [[Peter Wright]] as having been in a position to have passed information to the Soviets, and to Wright, MI5's official spy hunter, she explained her situation; Wright took no action. In fact her work as civil servant was in fields such as family policy and so would have been of no interest to the Soviets.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1487412/Jenifer-Hart.html Obituary of Jenifer Hart], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 9 April 2005.</ref> The person who recruited her, [[Bernard Floud]], interviewed by Wright shortly after, maintained that he was unable to remember ever having done so. Nor was her husband in a position to convey to her information of use, despite vague newspaper suggestions, given the sharp separation of his work from that of foreign affairs and its focus on German spies and British turncoats rather than on matters related to the Soviet ally. In fact, Hart was anticommunist.\u000a\u000aThe marriage contained "incompatible personalities", though it lasted right to the end of their lives and gave joy to both at times. Hart did joke with his daughter at one point, however, that "[t]he trouble with this marriage is that one of us doesn't like sex and the other doesn't like food".<ref>Margaret Howatson, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jenifer-hart-530553.html Obituary: Jenifer Hart,] ''The Independent'', 31 March 2005.</ref> Jenifer Hart was believed by her contemporaries to have had an affair of long duration with [[Isaiah Berlin]], a close friend of Hart's. Jenifer published her memoirs under the title ''Ask Me No More'' in 1998. The Harts had four children, including, late in life, a son who was disabled, the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck having deprived his brain of oxygen. The boy was, despite his handicap, capable of remarkable observations on occasion. As a philosopher, Hart had long been interested in the [[mind-body problem]], and he was thus in some sense professionally interested in his son, as well as emotionally invested, if only because his child was first-hand proof of the complex and unpredictable nature of the relationship between mind and body.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\u000a\u000aHis granddaughter [[Mojo Mathers]] became New Zealand's first deaf Member of Parliament in 2011.\u000a\u000aThere is a description of the Hart's household by the writer on religion [[Karen Armstrong]], who lodged with them for a time to help take care of their disabled son. The description appears in her book ''The Spiral Staircase''.<ref>{{Citation|publisher = HarperPerennial | isbn = 978-0-00-712229-5 | title = The Spiral Staircase | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL9216389M/The_Spiral_Staircase | first=Karen | last=Armstrong | publication-date = 3 January 2005|id = 0007122292}}</ref>\u000a\u000aHart retired from the Chair of Jurisprudence in 1969 and was succeeded by [[Ronald Dworkin]]. He subsequently became Principal of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\u000a\u000a==Hart's students==\u000aMany of Hart's former students became important legal, moral, and political philosophers, including [[Brian Barry]], [[John Finnis]], [[John Gardner (lawyer)|John Gardner]], [[Kent Greenawalt]], [[Neil MacCormick]], [[William Twining]], [[Chin Liew Ten]], [[Joseph Raz]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]]. Hart also had a strong influence on the young [[John Rawls]] in the 1950s, when Rawls was a visiting scholar at Oxford shortly after finishing his PhD. Also, conspicuously, Peter M.S. Hacker, who took his D.Phil under Hart's supervision, then went in 1966 at then President J.D. Mabbott's invitation, to be philosophy tutor at St John's, Oxford, where he attained career distinction in providing definitive analytic commentaries on Wittgenstein's writings.\u000a\u000a==Philosophical method==\u000aHart strongly influenced the application of methods in his version of Anglo-American positive law to jurisprudence and the philosophy of law in the English-speaking world. Influenced by [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Hans Kelsen]], Hart brought the tools of analytic, and especially linguistic, philosophy to bear on the central problems of legal theory.\u000a\u000aHart's method combined the careful analysis of twentieth-century analytic philosophy with the jurisprudential tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]], the great English legal, political, and moral philosopher. Hart's conception of law had parallels to the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]'' formulated by Austrian legal philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]], though Hart rejected several distinctive features of Kelsen's theory.\u000a\u000aSignificant in the differences between Hart and Kelsen was the emphasis on the British version of positive law theory which Hart was defending as opposed to the Continental version of positive law theory which Kelsen was defending. This was studied in the University of Toronto Law Journal in an article titled "Leaving the Hart-Dworkin Debate" which maintained that Hart insisted in his book ''The Concept of Law'' on the expansive reading of positive law theory to include philosophical and sociological domains of assessment rather than the more focused attention of Kelsen who considered Continental positive law theory as more limited to the domain of jurisprudence itself.<ref>Keith Culver. "Leaving the Hart-Dworkin Debate', University of Toronto Law Journal, pp374-398.</ref>\u000a\u000aHart drew, among others, on [[Glanville Williams]] who had demonstrated his legal philosophy in a five-part article, "Language and the Law" and in a paper, "International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Word 'Law'". In the paper on international law, he sharply attacked the many jurists and international lawyers who had debated whether international law was "really" law. They had been wasting everyone's time, for the question was not a factual one, the many differences between municipal and international law being undeniable, but was simply one of conventional verbal usage, about which individual theorists could please themselves, but had no right to dictate to others.\u000a\u000aThis approach was to be refined and developed by H. L. A. Hart in the last chapter of ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) which showed how the use in respect of different social phenomena of an abstract word like ''law'' reflected the fact that these phenomena each shared, without necessarily all possessing in common, some distinctive features. Glanville had himself said as much when editing a student text on jurisprudence and he had adopted essentially the same approach to "The Definition of Crime".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\u000a\u000a== ''The Concept of Law'' ==\u000a{{Main article|The Concept of Law}}\u000aHart's most famous work is ''The Concept of Law'', first published in 1961, and with a second edition (including a new postscript) published posthumously in 1994. The book emerged from a set of lectures that Hart began to deliver in 1952, and it is presaged by his Holmes lecture, ''Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals'' delivered at Harvard Law School. ''The Concept of Law'' developed a sophisticated view of legal positivism. Among the many ideas developed in this book are:\u000a* A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign backed by the threat of punishment.\u000a* A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, such that a primary rule governs conduct, such as criminal law and secondary rules govern the procedural methods by which primary rules are enforced, prosecuted and so on. Hart specifically enumerates three secondary rules; they are:\u000a:* The [[Rule of Recognition]], the rule by which any member of society may check to discover what the primary rules of the society are. In a simple society, Hart states, the recognition rule might only be what is written in a sacred book or what is said by a ruler. Hart claimed the concept of rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm".\u000a:* The Rule of Change, the rule by which existing primary rules might be created, altered or deleted.\u000a:* The Rule of Adjudication, the rule by which the society might determine when a rule has been violated and prescribe a remedy.\u000a* A distinction between the internal and external points of view of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between the sociological and the legal perspectives of law.\u000a* A late reply (published as a postscript to the second edition) to [[Ronald Dworkin]], a rights-oriented legal philosopher (and Hart's successor at Oxford) who criticised Hart's version of legal positivism in ''[[Taking Rights Seriously]]'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985) and ''[[Law's Empire]]'' (1986).\u000a\u000a==Other work==\u000aWith [[Tony Honoré]], Hart wrote and published ''Causation in the Law'' (1959, second edition 1985), which is regarded as one of the important academic discussions of Causation in the legal context. The early chapters deal philosophically with the concept of cause and are clearly the work of Hart, while later chapters deal with individual cases in English law and are clearly his co-author's.\u000a\u000aAs a result of his famous debate with [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin]], on the role of the criminal law in enforcing moral norms, Hart wrote ''Law, Liberty and Morality'' (1963), which consisted of three lectures he gave at [[Stanford University]]. He also wrote ''The Morality of the Criminal Law'' (1965). Hart said that he believed Devlin's view of Mill's harm principle as it related to the decriminalisation of homosexuality was "perverse".<ref>Hart. H. L. A.

Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing, 1971.</ref> He later stated that he believed the reforms to the law regarding homosexuality that followed the [[Wolfenden report]] "didn't go far enough". Despite this, Hart reported later that he got on well personally with Devlin.<ref name="Sugarman" />\u000a\u000aHart gave lectures to the Labour Party on closing tax loopholes which were being used by the "[[ultra high-net-worth individual|super-rich]]".
