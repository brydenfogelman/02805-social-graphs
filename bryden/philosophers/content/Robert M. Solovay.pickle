Solovay has spent his career at the [[University of California]] at Berkeley, where his Ph.D. students include [[W. Hugh Woodin]] and [[Matthew Foreman]].\u000a\u000aSolovay's theorems include:\u000a* [[Solovay's theorem]] showing that, if one assumes the existence of an [[inaccessible cardinal]], then the statement "every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real number]]s is [[Lebesgue measurable]]" is consistent with [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] without the [[axiom of choice]];\u000a* Isolating the notion of [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]];\u000a* Proving that the existence of a [[measurable cardinal#Real-valued measurable|real valued measurable cardinal]] is [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with the existence of a measurable cardinal;\u000a* Proving that if <math>\u005clambda</math> is a strong limit [[singular cardinal]], greater than a [[strongly compact cardinal]] then <math>2^\u005clambda=\u005clambda^+</math> holds;\u000a* Proving that if <math>\u005ckappa</math> is an uncountable regular cardinal, and <math>S\u005csubseteq\u005ckappa</math> is a [[stationary set]], then <math>S</math> can be decomposed into the union of <math>\u005ckappa</math> disjoint stationary sets;\u000a* With [[Stanley Tennenbaum]], developing the method of iterated forcing and showing the consistency of [[Suslin's hypothesis]].\u000a* Outside of set theory, developing (with [[Volker Strassen]]) the [[Solovay\u2013Strassen primality test]], used to identify large [[natural number]]s that are [[prime number|prime]] with high [[probability]]. This method has had implications for [[cryptography]].\u000a* Proving that GL (the [[normal modal logic]] which has the instances of the schema <math>\u005cBox(\u005cBox A\u005cto A)\u005cto\u005cBox A</math> as additional axioms) completely axiomatizes the logic of the provability predicate of [[Peano Arithmetic]].\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000a* {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1970696|author=Solovay, Robert M.|title=A model of set-theory in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable|journal=Annals of Mathematics.
