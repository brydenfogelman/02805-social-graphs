V{{Distinguish|Hugh McColl}}\u000a[[File:Hugh McColl.gif|thumb|right|200px|Hugh MacColl]]\u000a'''Hugh MacColl''' (1831\u20131909) was a Scottish mathematician, [[logician]] and novelist.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aMacColl was the youngest son of a poor [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] family which was at least partly [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking. Hugh's father died when he was still an infant, and Hugh was educated largely thanks to the efforts of his elder brother [[Malcolm MacColl]], an [[Scottish Episcopalian|Episcopalian]] clergyman and friend and political ally of [[William Ewart Gladstone]].<ref>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=MacColl, Malcolm|volume= 2|page=508}}</ref> Early in his acquaintanceship with Gladstone, Malcolm MacColl persuaded the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician to provide funds for Hugh's education at Oxford. It was proposed to send him to Oxford University's [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St. Edmund Hall]], but Gladstone made this conditional on Hugh MacColl agreeing to take orders in the [[Church of England]].{{clarify|date=July 2014}} Hugh MacColl refused this condition and, as a result, never obtained a university education, which may have limited his contribution to philosophy, and certainly prevented him from ever obtaining a formal academic position.<ref>Source: Gladstone-MacColl Correspondence, British Library</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter a few years working in different areas of Great Britain, MacColl relocated to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], in France on the Channel, where he developed the greater part of his work and became a [[French citizen]]. MacColl was not obscure during his time. He was a lifelong regular contributor to the ''Educational Times''. His correspondents included the logicians [[William Stanley Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. He also corresponded, and argued in print, with the young [[Bertrand Russell]], and reviewed [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra'' for ''Mind'' magazine.\u000a\u000a==Works==\u000aHe is known for three main accomplishments:\u000a\u000a* During 1877-79, while working out a problem involving [[integral|integration]], he published a four-part article establishing the first known variant of the [[propositional calculus]], terming it the "calculus of equivalent statements", preceding [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''Begriffschrifft''. He subsequently published 11 articles in ''Mind'' magazine, 1880..1908, and a text,<ref>''Symbolic Logic and Its Applications'', 1906.

While described by a recent critic as "best left unread",<ref>Stein Haugom Olsen, "Why Hugh MacColl is not, and will never be, part of any literary canon" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=veLr_ux9LAUC ''The Quality of Literature: Linguistic Studies in Literary Evaluation''], ed. Willie van Peer, [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2008.</ref> the novels reveal social and moral values to which the author gave full expression in his 1909 publication ''Man's Origin, Destiny, and Duty'', an apology for [[Christianity]].\u000a\u000a==Legacy==\u000aThere is presently a long-term MacColl Project, a joint venture of [[Greifswald University]] in Germany and the [[University of Oslo]], which intends to publish a critical edition of his work. Furthermore, the group of logic and [[epistemology]] at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]] (France) develop MacColl's suggestions for a dynamic [[free logic]]. The December 1999 issue of the magazine ''[[Nordic Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' published the proceedings of a 1998 conference devoted to MacColl's work.\u000a\u000a==References==\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a*Rahman, S. & Redmond, J., 2008.
