Dewey is one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of [[pragmatism]] and is considered one of the founders of [[functional psychology]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}</ref> A well-known [[public intellectual]], he was also a major voice of [[progressive education]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].<ref>Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism'', (1995), p. 32</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |location= |year= |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]], [[art]], [[logic]], [[social theory]], and [[ethics]].\u000a\u000aThe overriding theme of Dewey's works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, "Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous."<ref>''Early Works'', 1:128 (Southern Illinois University Press) op cited in Douglas R.

Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed [[public opinion]], accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.\u000a\u000a==Life and works==\u000aJohn Dewey was born in [[Burlington, Vermont]], to a family of modest means.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gutek |first=Gerald L. |title=Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: A Biographical Introduction. |publisher=Pearson Education Inc |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-113809-X |pages=338}}</ref> Dewey was one of four boys born to Archibald Sprague Dewey and Lucina Artemisia Rich Dewey. The second born son and first John born to Archibald and Lucina died in a tragic accident on January 17, 1859. On October 20, 1859 John Dewey was born, forty weeks after the death of his older brother. Like his older, surviving brother, [[Davis Rich Dewey]], he attended the [[University of Vermont]], where he was initiated into [[Delta Psi (University of Vermont)|Delta Psi]], and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref>[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&id=59  Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa],  Phi Beta Kappa website,  accessed Oct 4, 2009</ref> in 1879. A significant professor of Dewey's at the University of Vermont was [[Henry A. P. Torrey]], the son-in-law and nephew of former University of Vermont president [[Joseph Torrey]]. Dewey studied privately with Torrey between his graduation from Vermont and his enrollment at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html bio of Dewey from ''Bowling Green State University'']</ref><ref>[[Louis Menand]], ''The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in the United States''. New York: Farrar, Staus and Giroux, 2002.</ref>\u000a\u000aAfter two years as a high-school teacher in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] and one teaching elementary school in the small town of [[Charlotte, Vermont]], Dewey decided that he was unsuited for employment in primary or secondary education. After studying with [[George Sylvester Morris]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Herbert Baxter Adams]], and [[G. Stanley Hall]], Dewey received his Ph.D from the School of Arts & Sciences at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 1884, he accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Michigan]] (1884\u201388 and 1889\u201394) with the help of [[George Sylvester Morris]]. His unpublished and now lost dissertation was titled "The Psychology of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]."\u000a\u000aIn 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded [[University of Chicago]] (1894\u20131904) where he developed his belief in Rational [[Empiricism]], becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled ''[[Thought and its Subject-Matter]]'', which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title ''[[Studies in Logical Theory]]'' (1903). During that time Dewey also initiated the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, ''[[The School and Society]]'' (1899). Disagreements with the administration ultimately caused his resignation from the University, and soon thereafter he relocated near the East Coast. In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the [[American Psychological Association]]. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at both [[Columbia University]] and Columbia University's [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]].<ref>[[The New York Times]] edition of January 19, 1953, page 27</ref> In 1905 he became president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. He was a longtime member of the [[American Federation of Teachers]].\u000a\u000aAlong with the historians [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[James Harvey Robinson]], and the economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], Dewey is one of the founders of [[The New School]].  Dewey's most significant writings were "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" (1896), a critique of a standard psychological concept and the basis of all his further work; ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), his celebrated work on progressive education; ''[[Human Nature and Conduct]]'' (1922), a study of the function of habit in human behavior; ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' (1927), a defense of democracy written in response to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925); ''[[Experience and Nature]]'' (1925), Dewey's most "metaphysical" statement; ''[[Art as Experience]]'' (1934), Dewey's major work on aesthetics; ''[[A Common Faith]]'' (1934), a humanistic study of religion originally delivered as the [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] at Yale; ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]'' (1938), a statement of Dewey's unusual conception of logic; ''[[Freedom and Culture]]'' (1939), a political work examining the roots of fascism; and ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'' (1949), a book written in conjunction with [[Arthur F. Bentley]] that systematically outlines the concept of trans-action, which is central to his other works. While each of these works focuses on one particular philosophical theme, Dewey included his major themes in most of what he published. He published more than 700 articles in 140 journals, and approximately 40 books.\u000a\u000aReflecting his immense influence on 20th-century thought, [[Hilda Neatby]], in 1953, wrote "Dewey has been to our age what [[Aristotle]] was to the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]], not a philosopher, but ''the'' philosopher."<ref>Hilda M.

Dewey and his wife, Alice, arrived in Shanghai on April 30, 1919,<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31043/31043-h/31043-h.htm Letters from China and Japan by Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey and John Dewey]</ref> just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in [[Shandong]] province to Japan.

Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of [[Bolshevism]] to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shi. For these audiences, Dewey represented "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as "Second Confucius". Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact, however, was on the forces for progressive education in China, such as Hu Shi and Chiang Monlin, who had studied with him, and [[Tao Xingzhi]], who had studied at Columbia School of Education.<ref>Wang, pp. 8\u201310, 13\u201314.</ref>\u000a\u000aTheir letters from China and Japan describing their experiences to their family were published in 1920, edited by their daughter Evelyn.<ref>John Dewey, Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey ''Letters from China and Japan''.

In ''Psychology'', Dewey attempted a synthesis between idealism and experimental science.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Field, Richard |title=John Dewey in ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' |publisher=Northwest Missouri State University|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/dewey.htm|accessdate= 29 August 2008}}</ref>\u000a\u000aWhile still professor of philosophy at Michigan, Dewey and his junior colleagues, [[James Hayden Tufts]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], together with his student [[James Rowland Angell]], all influenced strongly by the recent publication of  [[William James]]' ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890), began to reformulate psychology, emphasizing the social environment on the activity of mind and behavior rather than the physiological psychology of [[Wundt]] and his followers.\u000a\u000aBy 1894, Dewey had joined Tufts, with whom he would later write ''Ethics'' (1908), at the recently founded [[University of Chicago]] and invited Mead and Angell to follow him, the four men forming the basis of the so-called "Chicago group" of psychology.\u000a\u000aTheir new style of psychology, later dubbed [[functional psychology]], had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" which appeared in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1896, he reasons against the traditional [[stimulus-response]] understanding of the [[reflex arc]] in favor of a "circular" account in which what serves as "stimulus" and what as "response" depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed the idea that there is a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.\u000a\u000aDewey<!-- , not without polemic, --> was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1899.\u000a[[File:Timbre_USA_John_Dewey_oblW_21101968.jpg|thumb]]\u000aIn 1984, the American Psychological Association announced that [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878\u20131972) had become the first psychologist to be commemorated on a United States postage stamp.  However, psychologists Gary Brucato Jr. and [[John D. Hogan]] later made the case that this distinction actually belonged to John Dewey, who had been celebrated on an American stamp 17 years earlier.  While some psychology historians consider Dewey more of a philosopher than a bona fide psychologist,<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Benjamin, L.T. | year = 2003 | title = Why Can't Psychology Get a Stamp? | url =  | journal = Journal of applied psychoanalytic studies | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 443\u2013454 }}</ref> the authors noted that Dewey was a founding member of the A.P.A., served as the A.P.A.'s eighth President in 1899, and was the author of an 1896 article on the [[reflex arc]] which is now considered a basis of American functional psychology.<ref>Brucato, G. & Hogan, J.D.

He defined with precise brevity the criterion of validity common to these three schools, which lack agreed-upon definitions:\u000a\u000a{{quotation|\u000aBut in the proper interpretation of "pragmatic," namely the function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problem evoking the operations, the text that follows is thoroughly pragmatic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=john|title=Logic: The theory of Inquiry|year=1938|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=NY|page=iv}}</ref>}}\u000a\u000aHis concern for precise definition led him to detailed analysis of careless word usage, reported in ''Knowing and the Known'' in 1949.\u000a\u000a===Epistemology===\u000a{{Main| Knowing and the Known}}\u000aThe terminology problem in the fields of epistemology and logic is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley,<ref>John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''.

Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advance, while the ultimate subject matter of logic generates unremitting controversy. In other words, he challenges confident logicians to answer the question of the truth of logical operators. Do they function merely as abstractions (e.g., pure mathematics) or do they connect in some essential way with their objects, and therefore alter or bring them to light?<ref name="logical">"The Problem of Logical Subject Matter", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' 1938</ref>\u000a\u000a[[File:John Dewey Grave.JPG|thumb|Grave of Dewey and his wife in an alcove on the north side of the [[Ira Allen Chapel]] in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. The only grave on the [[University of Vermont]] campus]]\u000a\u000a[[Logical positivism]] also figured in Dewey's thought. About the movement he wrote that it "eschews the use of 'propositions' and 'terms', substituting 'sentences' and 'words'." ("General Theory of Propositions", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'') He welcomes this changing of referents "in as far as it fixes attention upon the symbolic structure and content of propositions." However, he registers a small complaint against the use of "sentence" and "words" in that without careful interpretation the act or process of transposition "narrows unduly the scope of symbols and language, since it is not customary to treat gestures and diagrams (maps, blueprints, etc.) as words or sentences."\u000aIn other words, sentences and words, considered in isolation, do not disclose intent, which may be inferred or "adjudged only by means of context."<ref name="logical" />\u000a\u000aYet Dewey was not entirely opposed to modern logical trends. Concerning traditional logic, he states:\u000a{{quote|Aristotelian logic, which still passes current nominally, is a logic based upon the idea that qualitative objects are existential in the fullest sense. To retain logical principles based on this conception along with the acceptance of theories of existence and knowledge based on an opposite conception is not, to say the least, conductive to clearness \u2013 a consideration that has a good deal to do with existing dualism between traditional and the newer relational logics.}}\u000a\u000a[[Louis Menand]] argues in ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' that [[Jane Addams]] had been critical of Dewey's emphasis on antagonism in the context of a discussion of the [[Pullman strike]] of 1894. In a later letter to his wife, Dewey confessed that Addams' argument was:\u000a\u000a{{quote|...the most magnificent exhibition of intellectual & moral faith I ever saw. She converted me internally, but not really, I fear.... When you think that Miss Addams does not think this as a philosophy, but believes it in all her senses & muscles-- Great God... I guess I'll have to give it [all] up & start over again.}}\u000a\u000aHe went on to add:\u000a\u000a{{quote|I can see that I have always been interpreting dialectic wrong end up, the unity as the reconciliation of opposites, instead of the opposites as the unity in its growth, and thus translated the physical tension into a moral thing... I don't know as I give the reality of this at all,... it seems so natural & commonplace now, but I never had anything take hold of me so.<ref>Louis Menand. ''The Metaphysical Club'' p. 313</ref>}}\u000a\u000aIn a letter to Addams herself, Dewey wrote, clearly influenced by his conversation with her:\u000a\u000a{{quote|Not only is actual antagonizing bad, but the assumption that there is or may be antagonism is bad-- in fact, the real first antagonism always comes back to the assumption.}}\u000a\u000a===Aesthetics===\u000a{{Main|Art as Experience}}\u000a''Art as Experience'' (1934) is Dewey's major writing on aesthetics.\u000a\u000aIt is, in accordance with his place in the Pragmatist tradition that emphasizes community, a study of the individual art object as embedded in (and inextricable from) the experiences of a local culture. In the original illustrated edition, Dewey drew on the modern art and world cultures collection assembled by [[Albert C. Barnes]] at the [[Barnes Foundation]], whose own ideas on the application of art to one's way of life was influenced by Dewey's writing. Barnes was particularly influenced by "Democracy and Education" (1916)  and then attended Dewey's seminar on political philosophy at Columbia University in the fall semester of 1918.\u000a\u000a==On philanthropy, women and democracy==\u000aDewey founded the University of Chicago laboratory school, supported educational organizations, and supported settlement houses especially  [[Jane Addams]]\u2019 Hull House.<ref name="muse.jhu.edu">{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29\u201339|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}</ref>\u000a\u000aThrough his work at the [[Hull House]] serving on its first board of trustees, Dewey was not only an activist for the cause but also a partner working to serve the large immigrant community of Chicago and women\u2019s suffrage.

Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.\u000a\u000aThe ideas of democracy and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey's writings on education. Dewey makes a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that "to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities" (''My pedagogic creed'', Dewey, 1897). In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction".\u000a\u000aIn addition to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, "the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened" (1902, p.&nbsp;13).<ref>Dewey, J. (1902). ''The child and the curriculum''. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books</ref> He argues that in order for education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Dewey was alarmed by many of the "child-centered" excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much reliance on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, "we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" (Dewey, 1902, p.&nbsp;13\u201314). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.\u000a\u000aIn order to rectify this dilemma, Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student. He notes that "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction" (Dewey, 1902, p.&nbsp;16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey became one of the most famous proponents of [[hands-on learning]] or [[experiential education]], which is related to, but not synonymous with [[experiential learning]]. He argued that "if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind" (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013218).<ref>Dewey, J. (2009). ''Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education''. New York: WLC Books. (Original work published 1916)</ref> Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. [[Problem-Based Learning]] (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.<ref>Savery, J. R. (2006). Overview of Problem-based Learning: De\ufb01nitions and Distinctions. ''Journal of Problem-based\u000aLearning'', 1(1).</ref>\u000a\u000aDewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process.  Throughout the history of American schooling, education\u2019s purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job.  The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K-12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce.  In ''The School and Society'' (Dewey, 1976) and ''Democracy of Education'' (Dewey, 1980), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies.  Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1976; 1980).\u000a\u000aFor Dewey and his philosophical followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge is transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner.  Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process.  For Dewey, \u201cThe thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education\u201d (Dewey, 1904, p.&nbsp;18).  Dewey\u2019s qualifications for teaching\u2014a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others\u2014are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills.  Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which \u201cwork automatically, unconsciously\u201d (Dewey, 1904, p.&nbsp;15).  Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.\u000a\u000a===Professionalization of teaching as a social service===\u000a\u000aFor many, education\u2019s purpose is to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job.  As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904).  For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress.  As Dewey notes, "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence.  Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached.  It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life.  If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in production of character(Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.p.241-242).\u000a\u000aAccording to Dewey, the emphasis is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is \u201cimpossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now\u201d (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.&nbsp;25).  However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society.  While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a \u201clack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill and character\u201d (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.&nbsp;242) of the nation\u2019s workforce.  As Dewey notes, there is a lack of these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them.  According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.\u000a\u000a===A teacher's knowledge===\u000a\u000aDewey believed that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach.  For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one\u2019s ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge.  "No one," according to Dewey, "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [of teaching] who does not retain [her] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [her] entire career" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&nbsp;34).  According to Dewey, it is not that the \u201cteacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach,\u201d rather, \u201ca teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject:  history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever\u201d (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&nbsp;35).  The classroom teacher does not have to be a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.\u000a\u000aIn addition to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, the classroom teacher \u201cis possessed by a recognition of the responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils\u201d (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&nbsp;37).  For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g. the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 & Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching.  As Dewey notes, \u201cthis further study is not a side line but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation\u201d (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&nbsp;34).\u000a\u000aAccording to Dewey, this propensity and passion for intellectual growth in the profession must be accompanied by a natural desire to communicate one\u2019s knowledge with others.  \u201cThere are scholars who have [the knowledge] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it.  To the \u2018natural born\u2019 teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared\u201d (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&nbsp;35).  For Dewey, it is not enough for the classroom teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.\u000a\u000a===A teacher's skill===\u000a\u000aThe best indicator of teacher quality, according to Dewey, is the ability to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904).  As Dewey notes, "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers.  The explanation is simple.  They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with.  Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&nbsp;36).  Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.\u000a\u000a===A teacher's disposition===\u000a\u000aAs a result of the direct influence teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010).  Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities which the teacher brings to the classroom.  As Dewey notes, "no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency" (Dewey, TLS, p.&nbsp;25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.\u000a\u000aAccording to Dewey, the successful classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children.  In addition, she knows that her career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; all of which have the potential to overcome her genuine love and sympathy for her students.   For Dewey, "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners.  While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well.  And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way.  Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.&nbsp;35).\u000a\u000aIt is essential, according to Dewey, that the classroom teacher has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010).  Such negative demeanors, according to Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth.  It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.\u000a\u000a===The role of teacher education to cultivate the professional classroom teacher===\u000a\u000aDewey\u2019s passions for teaching\u2014a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others\u2014are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills.  Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which \u201cwork automatically, unconsciously\u201d (Dewey, 1904, p.&nbsp;15).  According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010).  As Dewey notes, "The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development.  But later \u2018progress\u2019 may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed.  Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching.  Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers\u2019 journals, attending teachers\u2019 institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity.  Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life" (Dewey, 1904, p.&nbsp;15).  For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge.  According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching.  Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one\u2019s self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.\u000a\u000aAs Dewey notes, other professional fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit in their fields to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession.  Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010).  As Dewey notes, "An intellectual responsibility has got to be distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility--it is to diffuse irresponsibility" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&nbsp;39).  For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils.  Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.\u000a\u000aAs well as his very active and direct involvement in setting up educational institutions such as the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] (1896) and [[The New School for Social Research]] (1919), many of Dewey's ideas influenced the founding of [[Bennington College]] and Goddard College in Vermont, where he served on the Board of Trustees. Dewey's works and philosophy also held great influence in the creation of the short-lived [[Black Mountain College]] in North Carolina, an experimental college focused on interdisciplinary study, and whose faculty included [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], among others. Black Mountain College was the locus of the "Black Mountain Poets" a group of avant-garde poets closely linked with the [[Beat Generation]] and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].\u000a\u000a==On journalism==\u000a{{Main| The Public and its Problems}}\u000aSince the mid-1980s, Deweyan ideas have experienced revival as a major source of inspiration for the public journalism movement. Dewey's definition of "public," as described in ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'', has profound implications for the significance of journalism in society. As suggested by the title of the book, his concern was of the transactional relationship between publics and problems. Also implicit in its name, public journalism seeks to orient communication away from elite, corporate hegemony toward a civic public sphere. "The 'public' of public journalists is Dewey's public."\u000a\u000aDewey gives a concrete definition to the formation of a public. Publics are spontaneous groups of citizens who share the indirect effects of a particular action. Anyone affected by the indirect consequences of a specific action will automatically share a common interest in controlling those consequences, i.e., solving a common problem.<ref>Dewey, J. 1927. ''The Public and its Problems''. Henry Holt & Co., New York. pp 126.</ref> <br /> Since every action generates [[unintended consequence]]s, publics continuously emerge, overlap, and disintegrate.\u000a\u000aIn ''The Public and its Problems'', Dewey presents a rebuttal to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s treatise on the role of journalism in democracy.  Lippmann's model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to the public, whose role was to react emotionally to the news.  In his model, Lippmann supposed that the public was incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.\u000a\u000aDewey refutes this model by assuming that politics is the work and duty of each individual in the course of his daily routine.  The knowledge needed to be involved in politics, in this model, was to be generated by the interaction of citizens, elites, experts, through the mediation and facilitation of journalism. In this model, not just the government is accountable, but the citizens, experts, and other actors as well.\u000a\u000aDewey also said that journalism should conform to this ideal by changing its emphasis from actions or happenings (choosing a winner of a given situation) to alternatives, choices, consequences, and [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]],<ref>[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] . Conditions and Consequences. American Philosophy: an Encyclopedia. 2007. Eds. John Lachs and Robert Talisse. New York: Routledge. Pages 124\u20137.</ref> in order to foster conversation and improve the generation of knowledge.  Journalism would not just produce a static product that told what had already happened, but the news would be in a constant state of evolution as the public added value by generating knowledge.  The "audience" would end, to be replaced by citizens and collaborators who would essentially be users, doing more with the news than simply reading it.  Concerning his effort to change journalism, he wrote in ''The Public and its Problems'':  "Till the Great Society is converted in to a Great Community, the Public will remain in eclipse.  Communication can alone create a great community" (Dewey, p.&nbsp;142).\u000a\u000aDewey believed that communication creates a great community, and citizens who participate actively with public life contribute to that community. "The clear consciousness of a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy." (''The Public and its Problems'', p.&nbsp;149). This Great Community can only occur with "free and full intercommunication." (p.&nbsp;211) Communication can be understood as journalism.\u000a\u000a==On humanism==\u000aAs an atheist<ref>{{cite book|title=Dewey at One Hundred Fifty|year=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535504|page=22|authorlink=Larry A.
