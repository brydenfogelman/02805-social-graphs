He is counted among the founders of [[Ricardian economics|Ricardian school]]<ref name="keynes11">''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' by [[John Maynard Keynes]], Chapter 1, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch01.htm#1 Footnote 1]</ref> and was the father of [[John Stuart Mill]], the philosopher of [[liberalism]]. His influential ''[[The History of British India|History of British India]]'' contains a complete denunciation and rejection of Indian culture and civilisation. He divided Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British.\u000a\u000a==Life==\u000aJames Milne, later known as James Mill, was born at Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, [[Angus]], Scotland, the son of James Milne, a [[shoemaker]] and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the [[Jacobite rising|Stuart rising]], resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the [[Montrose Academy]], where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.\u000a\u000aIn October 1798, he was ordained as a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], but met with little success. From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to [[London]], England, in company with [[Sir John Stuart, 4th Baronet|Sir John Stuart]] of [[Fettercairn]], then member of parliament for [[Kincardineshire]], and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the ''Literary Journal'', which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the ''St James's Chronicle'', belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of ''An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther'', a [[Charles de Villers|C.F. Villers]]'s work  on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year he began his ''[[The History of British India]]'', which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.\u000a\u000aIn that year he also married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in [[Hoxton]]. He then took a house in [[Pentonville]], where his eldest son, [[John Stuart Mill]], was born in 1806.\u000a\u000a[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of No. 19, York Street (1848). In 1651 [[John Milton]] moved into a "pretty garden-house" in [[Petty France, London|Petty France]]. He lived there until the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to [[Jeremy Bentham]], was occupied successively by James Mill and [[William Hazlitt]], and finally demolished in 1877.{{sfn|Stephen|1894|p=32}}]]\u000aIn 1808, he became acquainted with [[Jeremy Bentham]], and was for many years his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'', the ''British Review'' and ''[[The Eclectic Review]]''; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the [[Edinburgh Review]], to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being "Money and Exchange." He also wrote on Spanish America, China, [[Francisco de Miranda]], the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and the Liberty of the Press. In the ''Annual Review'' for 1808 two articles of his are traced\u2014a "Review of Fox's History," and an article on "Bentham's Law Reforms," probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] (1770\u20131843), a [[Quaker]] and [[chemist]], in a periodical called the ''Philanthropist''. He contributed largely to every issue\u2014his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's [[Panopticon]]). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the Bell and Lancaster controversy, and took a  part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the [[University of London]] in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of [[utilitarianism]], for the supplement to the fifth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the most important being those on "Jurisprudence," "Prisons", "Government" and "Law of Nations".\u000a\u000aIn 1818, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published, and obtained a great and immediate success.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1817 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= The History of British India |volume= |edition=1 |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1817 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish1817mill#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=2012-12-11 }}</ref> It brought about a change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in rank until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work, the ''Elements of Political Economy'', appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1821 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Elements of Political Economy |volume= |edition=First |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1821 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementsofpoliti00millrich#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=2012-12-11 }}</ref>\u000a\u000aFrom 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed to the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', started as the organ of his party, a number of articles in which he attacked the ''[[Edinburgh Review|Edinburgh]]'' and ''[[Quarterly Review|Quarterly]]'' Reviews and ecclesiastical establishments. In 1829 appeared the ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind''. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of directors. For the ''[[Westminster Review#London and Westminster Review|London Review]]'', founded by [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]] in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled "The Church and its Reform," which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the ''Review''. His last published book was the ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' (1835).\u000a\u000a==Intellectual legacy==\u000a\u000a===''The History of British India''===\u000a{{Main article|The History of British India}}\u000a\u000aMill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the [[Empiricism|empirical]] one common at the time. His best known literary work is his ''History of British India'', in which he describes the acquisition of the [[British India|Indian Empire]] by England and later the United Kingdom. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country. Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's ''History of India'' by notable economist [[Amartya Sen]].<ref>[[Amartya Sen]]'s address given to the Millennium Session of the Indian History Congress [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/458/history-and-the-enterprise-of-knowledge]</ref>\u000a\u000aAccording to [[Thomas Trautmann]], "James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) \u2013 most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters&nbsp;\u2013 is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism".<ref>{{cite book |title=Aryans and British India |pages=117 |first=Thomas R. |last=Trautmann |location=New Delhi |publisher=YODA Press |edition=2nd Indian |year=2006 |origyear=1997 |isbn=81-902272-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR_LPnEH3GsC&pg=PA117}}</ref> In the chapter titled General Reflections in "Of the Hindus", Mill wrote "under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy".<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of British India |first= James |last=Mill |publisher = Madden |year=1858 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfxAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150}}</ref> According to Mill, "the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and "in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were "dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were "disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves". Both were "cowardly and unfeeling". Both were "in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others". And, above all, both were "in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses".<ref>Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree.</ref>\u000a\u000a===British politics===\u000aMill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called "[[Philosophical Radicals|philosophic radicalism]]". His writings on government and his personal influence among the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians of his time determined the change of view from the [[French Revolution]] theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the [[Reform Bill]] was fought and won. His ''Elements of Political Economy'' followed up the views of his friend [[David Ricardo]]. By 1911, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] described it as being of mainly historical interest, "an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Among the more important of its theses are:\u000a\u000a#that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. § 2, art. 3)\u000a#that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and\u000a#that what is now known as the "[[unearned increment]]" of land is a proper object for taxation.\u000a\u000a===Other areas===\u000aBy his ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' and his ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as then represented by [[Thomas Reid]], [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], but made a new start, due in part to [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the ''Analysis'' is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on [[Franz Brentano]] who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology.<ref>Franz Brentano: ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt''. Ed. Oskar Kraus, 2 vols. Leipzig: Meiner, 1924\u201325; ed. Mauro Antonelli. Heusenstamm: Ontos, 2008</ref> The ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir [[James Mackintosh]]'s ''Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy'' (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.\u000a\u000a==Major works==\u000a[[File:Mill - Elements of political economy, 1826 - 5894644.tif|thumb|''Elements of political economy'', 1826]]\u000a*''An Essay on the Impolicy of a Bounty on the Exportation of Grain'', 1804.\u000a*"Lord Lauderdale on Public Wealth", 1804, ''Literary Journal''\u000a*''Commerce Defended'', 1808.\u000a*''Thomas Smith on Money and Exchange'', 1808\u000a*''[[The History of British India]]'', 3 vols., 1818 (and many later editions)\u000a*"Government", 1820, ''Encycl.
