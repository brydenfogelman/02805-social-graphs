Her aunt Mary studied philosophy and when her father asked her what that was all about, he could not understand her answer. Rosalind Hursthouse, 17 at the time, knew immediately that she wanted to study philosophy, too, and enrolled the next year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cheng |first1=Derek |title=The X-pert Files: Rosalind Hursthouse |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10362469 |accessdate=19 February 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=5 January 2006}}</ref> She taught for many years at the [[Open University]] in England. She was head of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Auckland]] from 2002 to 2005. Though she had written a substantial amount previously, Hursthouse entered the international philosophical scene for the first time in 1990\u201391, with three articles:\u000a\u000a{{Ordered list | ''Arational Actions'', which made an important break with models of [[action (philosophy)|voluntary human actions]] familiar from the work of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], with more general implications for those [[representative agent|models of human agency]] popular within [[positivism|positivist]] schools in the social sciences. Hursthouse turns her philosophical attention, and ours, to the kinds of reasons actually sought for and given by [[human beings]] in the [[explanation]] of [[human behaviour]]: what it is we really do as human beings, being, particularly, an [[emotion]]al as well as a [[reason|rational]], [[community|social]], [[public|political]], [[language|linguistic]], [[law]]ful [[animal]].\u000a\u000a| ''Virtue Theory and Abortion'', in which Hursthouse outlined the structure of a new version of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[virtue ethics]], defended it against possible objections, and applied it to the issue of abortion. Hursthouse collapses the theoretical/applied distinction in ethics, as well as the [[fact-value distinction|fact/value distinction]] in general. As a pioneering work in neo-Aristotelian practical philosophy, Hursthouse demonstrates the emphasis within virtue ethics, as a revitalised tradition in Western Philosophy, upon the realities of situated agents and their lives as wholes (including the consequences of their actions), and the salient capacities and considerations involved in truly acting well, or as well as is objectively possible, within whatever situation an agent may actually find herself in.\u000a\u000a| ''After Hume's Justice'', which offered an account of social justice in mainly Aristotelian and Wittgensteinian terms, and which, though Hursthouse did not seek to justify [[neoliberalism|prevailing liberal democratic institutions]], demonstrated that a modern [[practical philosophy]] conceptually centred upon '''virtue''' in its distinct sense when applied to human beings and our communities, can accommodate certain human or individual [[rights]]. Our [[praxis (process)|practice]] as (specifically human) [[agency (philosophy)|agents]] would naturally have to change through [[collective action]] if our [[institutions]] and their [[agency (sociology)|agents]] (and of course, given the primacy of [[ethics]] in Aristotle: we, ourselves) were to be truly '''virtuous''' in the complex sense connected to the [[eudaimonia|flourishing of human beings and our communities]]. This is implied by importing the conceptual structure of Neo-Aristotelian ethics from the analysis of the virtue of agents to the virtue of our [[social structure]]s, given the practical nature of such a philosophical investigation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Michael Slote |editors=Oppy, Graham & Trakakis, N.

Hursthouse's article "Virtue Theory and Abortion" argues that whereas most discussions of abortion focus on the issue of who has rights to make decisions regarding the foetus, a decision made within one's rights could still be callous or cowardly, meaning that it would be ethically problematic and potentially devastating for the person making it, whatever the status of the foetus and the reproductive rights of women.<ref name="OppyTrakakispage575" />\u000a\u000aHursthouse has also emphasised the practical nature of virtue ethics in her books ''Beginning Lives'' and ''Ethics, Humans, and Other Animals''. Hursthouse's most substantial contribution to modern virtue ethics is her book ''On Virtue Ethics'', which explores its structure as a distinctive action-guiding theory, the relationship between virtue, the emotions and moral motivation, and the place of the virtues within an overall account of human flourishing. It also expands her formulation of right action in terms of what a virtuous person would characteristically do.<ref name="OppyTrakakispage575">{{cite book |author=Daniel Russell |editors=Oppy, Graham & Trakakis, N.
