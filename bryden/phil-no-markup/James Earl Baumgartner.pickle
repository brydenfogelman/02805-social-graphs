VJames Earl Baumgartner (March 23, 1943 \u2013 December 28, 2011) was an American mathematician who worked in set theory, mathematical logic and foundations, and topology.\u000aBaumgartner was born in Wichita, Kansas, began his undergraduate study at the California Institute of Technology in 1960, then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, from which he received his PhD in 1970 from for a dissertation entitled Results and Independence Proofs in Combinatorial Set Theory. His advisor was Robert Vaught. He became a professor at Dartmouth College in 1969, and there spent his entire career.\u000aOne of Baumgartner's results is the consistency of the statement that any two \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u2135\u000a          \u000a            1\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005caleph _{1}}\u000a  -dense sets of reals are order isomorphic (a set of reals is \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u2135\u000a          \u000a            1\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005caleph _{1}}\u000a  -dense if it has exactly \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u2135\u000a          \u000a            1\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005caleph _{1}}\u000a   points in every open interval). With András Hajnal he proved the result (Baumgartner\u2013Hajnal theorem) that the partition relation \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u03c9\u000a          \u000a            1\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        \u2192\u000a        (\u000a        \u03b1\u000a        \u000a          )\u000a          \u000a            n\u000a          \u000a          \u000a            2\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005comega _{1}\u005cto (\u005calpha )_{n}^{2}}\u000a   holds for \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03b1\u000a        <\u000a        \u000a          \u03c9\u000a          \u000a            1\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        ,\u000a        n\u000a        <\u000a        \u03c9\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005calpha <\u005comega _{1},n<\u005comega }\u000a  . He died of a heart attack in 2011.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBaumgartner's axiom\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000aBaumgartner, James E., A new class of order types, Annals of Mathematical Logic, 9:187\u2013222, 1976\u000aBaumgartner, James E., Ineffability properties of cardinals I, Infinite and Finite Sets, Keszthely (Hungary) 1973, volume 10 of Colloquia Mathematica Societatis János Bolyai, pages 109\u2013130.
