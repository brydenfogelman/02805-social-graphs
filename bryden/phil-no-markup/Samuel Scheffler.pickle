VSamuel Scheffler (born 1951) is a moral and political philosopher who is University Professor in the Department of Philosophy and the Law School at New York University.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education and career ==\u000aBefore moving to NYU in 2008, Scheffler taught for 31 years at the University of California, Berkeley. Scheffler received his PhD from Princeton University, where he was a student of the distinguished philosopher Thomas Nagel. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2004.\u000aHe is the son of the Harvard philosopher Israel Scheffler.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Philosophy ==\u000aHis most recent book, Death and the Afterlife, based on his Tanner Lectures at University of California, Berkeley has generated considerable attention for its argument that much that we value in life depends on the assumption that life will continue long after our death. As the Princeton philosopher Mark Johnston (philosopher) explained in the Boston Review: "In Scheffler\u2019s self-consciously idiosyncratic use of the term, the 'afterlife' is neither a supernatural continuation of this life, nor the result of a deeper naturalistic understanding of the kind of thing we are; it is what John Stuart Mill called 'the onward rush of mankind,' the collective life of humanity after our individual deaths. Scheffler\u2019s thesis is that the onward rush of humankind\u2014the collective afterlife\u2014is much more important to us than we are ordinarily apt to notice." Assessing the argument, the English philosopher John Cottingham wrote: "Scheffler has produced a superb essay -- indeed it seems to me about as good as analytic philosophy gets. It is entirely free from obfuscating jargon and other tiresome tricks of the trade, yet it is meticulously argued and demanding in exactly the right way -- forcing us to think about hitherto unexamined implications of our existing beliefs."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected books ==\u000aDeath and the Afterlife (Oxford University Press, 2013)\u000aEquality and Tradition (Oxford University Press, 2010)\u000aBoundaries and Allegiances: Problems of Justice and Responsibility in Liberal Thought (Oxford University Press, 2001)\u000aThe Rejection of Consequentialism (Oxford University Press 2nd ed., 1994) (editor)\u000aHuman Morality (Oxford University Press, 1992)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aVideo interview with Scheffler.
