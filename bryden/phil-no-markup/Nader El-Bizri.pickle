VNader El-Bizri (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0632\u0631\u064a; born 1966, Sidon) is a British-Lebanese philosopher, historian of science, and architect living between Britain and Lebanon.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aHis name is 'Nader M. Mouhib El-Bizri'. He was born in 1966 in the city of Sidon (Saida) in south Lebanon. He completed his schooling at the Jesuit / Marist Collège Notre Dame de Fatima des Frères Maristes in Sidon. He qualified for his BArch in architecture from the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at the American University of Beirut (1989), and received the MArch-II in architecture from the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University (1994). He read philosophy at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University (1995), and got a PhD in Philosophy from the Graduate Faculty of the New School of Social Research in New York (1999). [1], [2], [3]\u000a\u000a\u000a== Intellectual profile ==\u000aNader El-Bizri's areas of expertise are in Phenomenology, in Arabic Sciences and philosophy, and Architectural Humanities (Architectural theory). He focuses mainly on theories of space/place and of perception, with a particular interest in classical optics and perspective Renaissance traditions. His interpretation of history of science and philosophy is guided by contemporary debates in epistemology and ontology (metaphysics). His philosophical analysis is principally oriented by phenomenological methods of investigation and interpretation, and his thinking is influenced by the traditions of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty; even though he is primarily Heideggerian in orientation when dealing with metaphysics, ontology, and Architectural theory.\u000aEl-Bizri also composed commentaries on these phenomenologists in addition to writing about notions central to the works of Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas. His research in history of science and philosophy, which also informs his investigations in architectural history, theory and criticism, is methodologically inspired by the legacies of scholars of history and philosophy of science like: Gaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, and Alexandre Koyré (while being also tangentially aware of the differential methods of Leo Strauss and Quentin Skinner). He developed an expertise in history of philosophy and science in Islamic civilisation, with a special focus on the traditions of polymaths like the optician and geometer Alhazen (al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham), the metaphysician and physician Avicenna (Abu 'Ali Ibn Sina), and the tenth-century encyclopaedist thinkers, the Brethren of Purity (Ikhwan al-Safa').\u000aEl-Bizri studied under Stanley Cavell, Hilary Putnam, Robert Nozick, and A. I. Sabra at Harvard University, and he also was the student of Richard J. Bernstein and Ágnes Heller at the Graduate Faculty of The New School for Social Research in New York. He also conducted research with the Islamic philosophy scholar Parviz Morewedge at the State University of New York in Binghamton [4]. In more recent years, he established solid academic collaborations with the influential phenomenologist Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Editor of Analecta Husserliana and President of The World Phenomenology Institute, New Hampshire, USA).[5]\u000aNader El-Bizri\u2019s corpus is interdisciplinary, and it passes across philosophy, history of scientific and philosophical ideas, and architectural thinking. It is phenomenological in orientation while being rooted in history of science and philosophy, it also seeks to investigate architectural humanities from the standpoint of phenomenology and intellectual history, as well as informing phenomenological inquiry by studies in architecture and in history of philosophy and science. There is also a hint at a fusion of European and Arabic/Islamic classical traditions in thought by way of an emphasis on shared Mediterranean legacies in the Greek-Arabic-Latin lineage. A thematic thread ties these various aspects of his research and thought through a focus on theories of space, place, time, being, and on themes in classical optics and mathematics. He is throughout concerned about issues of methodology in philosophy, intellectual history, and architecture, while probing their epistemic and conceptual consequences in analysis, critique, hermeneutics, historiography, and philology.\u000aEl-Bizri's interpretations of the history of the exact sciences in classical Islamic civilisation have been partly inspired by the legacy of the mathematician, historian and philosopher of science: Roshdi Rashed (Emeritus; CNRS, Paris). El-Bizri\u2019s approach to the history of mathematics in Greco-Arabic legacies within pre-modern Islamic contexts is bent on rendering the ancient texts readable to modern mathematicians. He thus sees the vocation of the historian of mathematics as being also that of the epistemologist and not strictly that of the humanist as a scholar of historiography per se. He is in this regard a philosopher more than being an Arabist or historian. This is for instance evident from his edition and annotated translation with commentaries of the epistles on geometry and arithmetic of the Brethren of Purity (Oxford University Press, 2012). [6] His method is also informed by ontology in considering the propositions and 'entities' of mathematics as being connected across historical epochs and transcending the differences in language and culture. This renders them translatable across epistemic and mathematical systems and not via a strict literalism due to their pure abstraction. He is not an advocate of 'presentism' per se, but he clearly sees shortcomings in 'antiquarianism'. He rather studies the epistemic history of mathematics and the exact sciences (in a take from within historical epistemology), and he interprets mathematical and scientific notions in context and also in light of later concepts. He is a philosopher in support of modernisation in approaching the epistemic history of knowledge and the questions of ontology, more than being only an archival historian who is solely focused on philological documentation and historiography.\u000aIn recent studies that aim at 'renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam', El-Bizri offers critical analyses of the conventions of methodology and historiography that dominate the mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying 'Islamic philosophy' from 'archival' standpoints, within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies; arguing that these do not usually recognise the fact that 'philosophy in Islam' can still be a living intellectual tradition, and that its renewal requires a radical reform in ontology, epistemology and cosmology within Islamic thought, which have primacy over the emphasis on theories of value, on politics and law. El-Bizri's interpretations of Avicenna (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of Heidegger's critique of the history of metaphysics aimed at finding new pathways in ontology that are not simply Avicennian nor Heideggerian, even though his approach in rethinking falsafa in terms of a renewal in Avicennism (amounting to what he takes to be a "Neo-Avicennism") carries resonances with separate novel modern ways of reading Aristotelianism and Thomism as exemplified by the philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre. El-Bizri tackles contemporary issues in philosophy through a fundamental critical analytic of the evolution of key concepts in the history of ontology and epistemology. He is a modernist in outlook since he aims to bring newness to the tradition rather than reproduce it or simply claim to be in a rupture with it.\u000aBesides his research in phenomenology, and history and philosophy of the exact sciences, Nader El-Bizri contributes to the philosophical debates within contemporary Architectural theory and Architectural humanities, through his studies on visual perception and on space/place (including the reflections of Heidegger on dwelling in the age of the Gestell of the essence of modern technology, and Derrida's interpretation of Plato's Khôra), in addition to his investigation of theories of vision as informed by the phenomenological traditions (Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty in particular), and in Graeco-Arabic optics (with a focus on the legacy of Alhazen), along with his research on the perspective legacies in Renaissance pictorial/architectural arts (including the geometrical oeuvres of Desargues). This has gained him a prominent position in architectural theory and humanities besides his contributions to this academic field from the standpoint of his specialized research in phenomenology and history of science and philosophy. However, El-Bizri\u2019s interest in probing the merits of Heideggerian terminology and concepts in interpreting the history of metaphysics, and in thinking about \u2018dwelling\u2019 and the essence of modern technology in architectural theory, is not uncritical of the ethical-political ramifications of Heidegger\u2019s biography. A new direction is emerging in El-Bizri's thought that is informed by his critical-analytic reading of Heidegger's and Levinas' reflections on being, death, time, nihilism, nothingness, and on conceptions of 'subjectivity/intersubjectivity'.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Academic and professional profile ==\u000aNader El-Bizri is a visiting professor of visual studies at the University of Lincoln and a principal lecturer (reader) in architecture, [7] and he teaches at the American University of Beirut as a professor of philosophy and chairperson of the Civilization Studies Program, and as the director of the Anis Makdisi Program in Literature and the Humanistic Disciplines [8], and as the coordinator of graduate programs in Islamic Studies.
