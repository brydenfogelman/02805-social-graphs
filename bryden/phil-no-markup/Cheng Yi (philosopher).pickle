He worked with his older brother Cheng Hao (\u7a0b\u9865). Like his brother, he was a student of Zhou Dunyi, a friend of Shao Yong, and a nephew of Zhang Zai. The five of them along with Sima Guang are called the Six Great Masters of the 11th century by Zhu Xi.\u000aCheng entered the national university in 1056, and received the "presented scholar" degree in 1059. He lived and taught in Luoyang, and declined numerous appointments to high offices. In 1086, he was appointed expositor-in-waiting and gave many lectures to the emperor on Confucianism. He was more aggressive and obstinate than his brother, and made several enemies, including Su Shi, the leader of the Sichuan group. In 1097, his enemies were able to ban his teachings, confiscate his properties, and banish him. He was pardoned three years later, but was blacklisted and again his work was banned in 1103. He was finally pardoned in 1106, one year before his death.\u000aCheng Yi's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (\u4e94\u7ecf\u535a\u58eb; \u4e94\u7d93\u535a\u58eb; W\u01d4j\u012bng Bóshì).\u000aIn 1452 Wujing Boshi was bestowed upon the offspring of Mengzi-Meng Xiwen \u5b5f\u5e0c\u6587 56th generation and Yan Hui-Yan Xihui \u9854\u5e0c\u60e0 59th generation, the same was bestowed on the offspring of Zhou Dunyi-Zhou Mian \u9031\u5195 12th generation, the two Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi-Chen Keren \u7a0b\u514b\u4ec1 17th generation), Zhu Xi-Zhu Ting \u6731\u68b4 (Zhu Chan?) 9th generation, in 1456-1457, in 1539 the same was awarded to Zeng Can's offspring-Zeng Zhicui \u66fe\u8cea\u7cb9 60th generation, in 1622 the offspring of Zhang Zai received the title and in 1630 the offspring of Shao Yong.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a"Cheng Yi".
