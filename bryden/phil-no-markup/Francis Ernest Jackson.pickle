He himself believed unity to be the first quality of any picture, in which the simplest conception will be found always to be the most beautiful. Reality and art were not connected, but running in parallel one unto the other, and therefore in the final conception of the painting there ought to be no instant of accident, as though nature itself were allowed a role in the process.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==
