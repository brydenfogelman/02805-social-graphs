VGerhard Vollmer (born 17 November 1943 in Speyer) is a German physicist and philosopher. He is perhaps best known for his development of an evolutionary theory of knowledge.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aVollmer studied in Munich, Berlin, Hamburg and Freiburg. After finishing his degree in physics in 1968 he studied philosophy and linguistics in Freiburg. He worked as a trainee in Deutschen Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg. In Freiburg he attained a doctorate (1971) in theoretical physics. He stayed here after completing a year's stint as a research assistant in Montreal in 1975. In 1974, Vollmer attained an additional doctorate in philosophy.\u000aFrom 1975 Vollmer taught at the University of Hanover. From 1981 he lectured on the Philosophy of Biology at the University of Giessen. From 1991 he has taught philosophy at the TU Braunschweig. He holds lectures and classes in logic, epistemology and philosophy of science, natural philosophy, and artificial intelligence. He has also worked on evolutionary ethics, which he says consists of attempts to add evolutionary points of view to philosophical ethics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours and associations ==\u000aIn 1963 he was awarded the Magnus Schwerd Prize for outstanding achievements in mathematics at school.\u000aVollmer became a member in 1998 of the Leopoldina Academy of Sciences Halle.

Philosophie von einem rationalen Standpunkt" edited by Wolfgang Buschlinger and Christoph Lütge, published by Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart).\u000aIn 2004 he received the Eduard Rhein Foundation Cultural Prize for having laid down the \u201cfoundation of an evolutionary theory of knowledge and for his outstanding achievement in bridging natural sciences and the social and humanistic disciplines\u201d.\u000aHe is one of the editors of the periodical Aufklärung und Kritik. He is a member of the Science Advisory Committee of the Gesellschaft zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften (GWUP), a German-speaking organisation supporting scientific skepticism.
