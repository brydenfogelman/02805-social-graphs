VRobert Martin Solovay (born December 15, 1938) is an American mathematician specializing in set theory.\u000aSolovay earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1964 under the direction of Saunders Mac Lane, with a dissertation on A Functorial Form of the Differentiable Riemann\u2013Roch theorem. Solovay has spent his career at the University of California at Berkeley, where his Ph.D. students include W. Hugh Woodin and Matthew Foreman.\u000aSolovay's theorems include:\u000aSolovay's theorem showing that, if one assumes the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, then the statement "every set of real numbers is Lebesgue measurable" is consistent with ZF without the axiom of choice;\u000aIsolating the notion of 0#;\u000aProving that the existence of a real valued measurable cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal;\u000aProving that if \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03bb\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005clambda }\u000a   is a strong limit singular cardinal, greater than a strongly compact cardinal then \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          2\u000a          \u000a            \u03bb\u000a          \u000a        \u000a        =\u000a        \u000a          \u03bb\u000a          \u000a            +\u000a          \u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle 2^{\u005clambda }=\u005clambda ^{+}}\u000a   holds;\u000aProving that if \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03ba\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005ckappa }\u000a   is an uncountable regular cardinal, and \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        S\u000a        \u2286\u000a        \u03ba\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle S\u005csubseteq \u005ckappa }\u000a   is a stationary set, then \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        S\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle S}\u000a   can be decomposed into the union of \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03ba\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005ckappa }\u000a   disjoint stationary sets;\u000aWith Stanley Tennenbaum, developing the method of iterated forcing and showing the consistency of Suslin's hypothesis.\u000aOutside of set theory, developing (with Volker Strassen) the Solovay\u2013Strassen primality test, used to identify large natural numbers that are prime with high probability. This method has had implications for cryptography.\u000aProving that GL (the normal modal logic which has the instances of the schema \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u25fb\u000a        (\u000a        \u25fb\u000a        A\u000a        \u2192\u000a        A\u000a        )\u000a        \u2192\u000a        \u25fb\u000a        A\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005cBox (\u005cBox A\u005cto A)\u005cto \u005cBox A}\u000a   as additional axioms) completely axiomatizes the logic of the provability predicate of Peano Arithmetic.\u000aWith Alexei Kitaev, proving that a finite set of quantum gates can efficiently approximate an arbitrary unitary operator on one qubit.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000aSolovay, Robert M.
