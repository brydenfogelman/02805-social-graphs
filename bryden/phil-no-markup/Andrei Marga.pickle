VAndrei Marga (Romanian pronunciation: [an\u02c8drej \u02c8mar\u0261a]; born 22 May 1946) is a Romanian philosopher, political scientist, and politician. Rector \u2013 for the second time \u2013 of the Babe\u015f-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, he was a member of the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (PN\u0162CD), serving as Minister of Education in the Democratic Convention (CDR) coalition governments of Victor Ciorbea, Radu Vasile, and Mugur Is\u0103rescu (1997-2000). In January 2001, he replaced Ion Diaconescu as PN\u0162CD chairman, but resigned from his post in July 2001, amid political tensions in the party. He formed a new party, the Popular Christian Party later in the year. Later, he affiliated with the National Liberal Party (PNL).\u000aMarga has authored a large number of volumes on political science, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history. His work touches a variety of subjects, including the philosophical theories of Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas, the nature of positivism, and trends in contemporary philosophy. He has also lectured on specific subjects, such as the philosophic foundations of transition from communism to a market economy, and the evolution of principles guiding European integration. In later works, he approached topics pertaining to the philosophy of religion, and to the status of religion in the age of globalization. In 2005, Andrei Marga received the Herder Prize in recognition of his contributions.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aMarga was born in Bucharest, attended the University of Cluj and also had a one-year scholarship at the University of Freiburg (West Germany).\u000aIn 1993, he became the rector of the Babe\u015f-Bolyai University, of Cluj-Napoca.\u000aAs minister, Andrei Marga promoted educational system reform, stressing that the communist legacy had contributed to a rise in political corruption, and indicating that Romanian education lacked staples of professionalism such as underlined purposes, standards in certification, and evaluation criteria. Marga also criticized the system for relying on "original features" and "Romanian traditions", which had been explained as a means to promote national development, but, in effect, had contributed to the gap between Romania and the Western world. He called for modernization, and defined his goals as "increasing the links between education and the economic, administrative and cultural environment, improving the educational infrastructure, eliminating paternalism and populism from educational management, and enhancing international cooperation in education".\u000aThe program was criticized by the political opposition, who argued that the system in place was satisfactory, and blamed the existing problems on the post-1989 political and social climate. In parallel, supporters of reform were dissatisfied with its slow pace and inadequate financing.\u000aIn early 1998, a controversy erupted in Romanian politics, after the CDR announced that it was planning to stand by the plan to set up separate universities for the Hungarian minority. The decision was in turn based on a promise made to their coalition partner, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. In this context, Marga took the middle ground, saying that he supported separate Hungarian-language sections but not separate institutions (a similar view was expressed by the CDR's other coalition partner, the Democratic Party).\u000aMarga joined the PN\u0162CD in 1999, and became its leader two years later. Party rules prohibited members with less than five years in the party from running for party president. During the party's congress, a few candidates resigned in support of Marga and the party's constitution was amended to allow Marga to run. Marga defeated his conservative opponents with the support of the congress in spite of opposition from the party hierarchy. He was brought in to reform the party and position it to recover from the losses of the December 2000 election. His tenure failed to bring in the rapid changes desired and opposition from prominent conservative elements in his party stifled his ideas. He resigned in July 2001.\u000aIn 2002, Marga joined the PN\u0162CD's former coalition partner, the National Liberal Party. From May to August 2012, Marga served as Foreign Minister in the government of Victor Ponta.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Published works ==\u000aHerbert Marcuse. Studiu critic ("Herbert Marcuse.
