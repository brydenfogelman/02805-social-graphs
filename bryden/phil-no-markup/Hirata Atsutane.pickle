VHirata Atsutane (\u5e73\u7530 \u7be4\u80e4, 6 October 1776 \u2013 2 November 1843) was a Japanese scholar, conventionally ranked as one of the four great men of kokugaku (nativist) studies, and one of the most significant theologians of the Shint\u014d religion. His literary name was Ibukinoya.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life and thought ==\u000aHirata was born to a low-ranking samurai family of Akita domain (in present-day Akita Prefecture) in the T\u014dhoku region of northern Japan. His father was named \u014cwada Yoshitane, and Hirata was adopted by Matsuyama retainer Hirata T\u014dbei, from whom he received the family name of Hirata in 1800. Little is known of his early life, but Hirata was a student of the Neo-Confucianism of Yamazaki Ansai (1619\u20131682) in Edo. He later turned towards Daoism as found in the works of the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi, and towards Shint\u014d as per the works of Motoori Norinaga, founder of the kokugaku movement.\u000aThough he is traditionally ranked fourth in the lineage of kokugaku scholars, Hirata actually represents a break with the purely scholarly urban culture characteristic of the revival of classical nativist learning, and represents a trend toward a populist message. Hirata laid particular emphasis on reaching the average man, and adapted his own style to them by employing at times the vernacular idiom.\u000aHirata claimed later to have received the mantle of kokugaku teacher in a dream directly from Motoori Norinaga, but the story is apocryphal. Hirata's interest in kokugaku postdates Motoori's own death.\u000aHirata was a prolific writer. Representative works in the study of ancient Japanese traditions include Tama no mihashira (The True Pillar of Spirit), Koshi seibun (Treatise on Ancient History), Kod\u014d taii (True Meaning of the Ancient Way) and Zoku Shint\u014d taii (True Meaning of Common Shint\u014d), and the commentaries Koshi-ch\u014d and Koshi-den. He is also noted for his studies of ancient Indian and Chinese tradition (Indo z\u014dshi and Morokoshi taikoden), and texts dealing with the spirit world, including Senky\u014d ibun (Strange Tales of the Land of Immortals) and Katsugor\u014d saisei kibun (Chronicle of the Rebirth of Katsugor\u014d). His early work Honky\u014d gaihen indicates an acquaintance with Christian literature that had been authored by Jesuits in China.\u000aHirata frequently expressed hostility to the Confucian and Buddhist scholars of the day, advocating instead a revival of the \u201cancient ways\u201d in which the emperor was to be revered. Hirata's first published work, Kamosho (1803) was a scathing attack on the works of Confucian philosopher Dazai Shundai (1680\u20131747) on Buddhism, and resulted in an invitation to teach from the Yoshida family, the hereditary clan leading Yoshida Shinto.\u000aThe contents of his 1841 treatise Tench\u014d muky\u016breki (Chronicle of the Perpetual Rule of the Emperor) angered the ruling Tokugawa bakufu government, and he was sentenced to confinement in Akita until his death in 1843.\u000aHirata's activities eventually attracted over 500 pupils, including Okuni Takamasa and Suzuki Shigetane. His nationalist writings had considerable impact on the samurai who supported the Sonn\u014d j\u014di movement and who fought in the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Meiji Restoration.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Influence ==\u000aAtsutane's influence on kokugaku has recently been thought to be overestimated. While he is called one of the "four great men of kokugaku", this is a phrase he invented himself. His work more often influenced religious groups than the government in the Empire of Japan.\u000aAmong Atsutane's more enduring contributions to Japanese thought was the idea that all Japanese were descended from the gods, not only the Imperial family and certain aristocratic families. As he put it, "this, our glorious land, is the land in which the gods have their origin, and we are one and all descendants of the gods. For this reason, if we go back from the parents who gave us life and being, beyond the grandparents and great-grandparents, and consider the ancestors of ancient times, then the original ancestors of those must necessarily have been the gods."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aGordon, Andrew (2003).
