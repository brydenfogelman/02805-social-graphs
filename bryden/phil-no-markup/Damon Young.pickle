The Australian called it lacking in precision, saying its "central proposition -- that new information technologies distract us from our common existential challenge -- is never thoroughly probed" while London's Financial Times called it "lucid and optimistic".\u000aPhilosophy in the Garden, published in Australia in December 2012, was described by The Australian as "fluent and stylish and never marred by cliches or cliched thinking". It was published in the UK in April 2014 by Rider, an imprint of Random House, under the title Voltaire's Vine and Other Philosophies: How Gardens Inspired Great Writers.\u000aYoung's columns, reviews and features have been published in The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian, Herald-Sun, BBC and ABC. He has written poetry and fiction for Overland and Meanjin magazines.\u000aYoung regularly comments on radio, and has appeared on Channel 7 'Sunrise' and ABC TV. He was a regular panellist on ABC Radio National's 'Life Matters', a monthly guest on "Mornings" with Alan Brough on ABC 774, and was 'philosopher-in-residence' on "Afternoons" with James Valentine on ABC Sydney 702, and "sports philosopher" with Francis Leach on SEN 1116.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected works ==\u000aA full list of Young's published works and media appearances can be found at his website.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aPhilosophy in the Garden.
