VPeter Kivy (born October 22, 1934) is a professor of musicology and philosophy at Rutgers University. He studies particularly the philosophy of music.\u000aHe earned master's degrees in both philosophy (University of Michigan, 1958) and musicology (Yale University, 1960). He earned his PhD at Columbia University in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.\u000aHis early work is on the 18th-century British aesthetics, and was influenced by Francis Hutcheson. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he has been interested mainly in music philosophy. His book The Corded Shell made him a central figure in music aesthetics.\u000aOne preoccupation of his has been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to "express" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by Stephen Davies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Books ==\u000aSpeaking of Art (1973).\u000aFrancis Hutcheson's Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, Design (ed., 1973).\u000aThomas Reid's Lectures on the Fine Arts (ed., 1973).\u000aThe Seventh Sense: A Study of Francis Hutcheson's Aesthetics, and its Influence in Eighteenth-Century Britain (1976, 2nd ed. 2003).\u000aThe Corded Shell: Reflections on Musical Expression (1980).\u000aSound and Semblance: Reflections on Musical Representation (1984, 2nd ed. 1991).\u000aOsmin's Rage: Philosophical Reflections on Opera, Drama and Text (1988, 2nd ed.).\u000aSound Sentiment: An Essay on Musical Emotions (1989).\u000aMusic Alone: Philosophical Reflections on the Purely Musical Experience (1990).\u000aEssays on the History of Aesthetics (ed., 1992)\u000aThe Fine Art of Repetition: And Other Essays in the Philosophy of Music (collection, 1993)\u000aAuthenticities: Philosophical Reflections on Musical Performance (1995).\u000aPhilosophies of Arts: An Essay in Differences (1997).\u000aNew Essays on Musical Understanding (collection, 2001)\u000aThe Possessor and the Possessed: Handel, Mozart, Beethoven and Idea of Musical Genius (2001).\u000aIntroduction to a Philosophy of Music (2002).\u000aThe Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics (ed., 2004)\u000aThe Performance of Reading: an Essay in the Philosophy of Literature (2006).\u000aMusic, Language, and Cognition: And Other Essays in the Philosophy of Music, further collected essays of Peter Kivy (collection, 2007).\u000aAntithetical Arts: On the Ancient Quarrel Between Literature and Music (2009).\u000aSounding Off: Eleven Essays in the Philosophy of Music (2012).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aSome criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in Music, Philosophy, and Modernity by Andrew Bowie, 2007.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aNaomi Cumming.
