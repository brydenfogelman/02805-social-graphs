VGautama Buddha, also known as Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama, Shakyamuni Buddha, or simply the Buddha, after the title of Buddha, was an ascetic (\u015brama\u1e47a) and sage, on whose teachings Buddhism was founded. He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in the eastern part of Ancient India sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE.\u000aGautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the \u015brama\u1e47a movement common in his region. He later taught throughout other regions of eastern India such as Magadha and Kosala.\u000aGautama is the primary figure in Buddhism. He is recognized by Buddhists as an enlightened or divine teacher who attained full Buddhahood, and shared his insights to help sentient beings end rebirth and suffering. Accounts of his life, discourses, and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by oral tradition and first committed to writing about 400 years later.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historical Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama ==\u000a\u000aScholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most accept that he lived, taught and founded a monastic order during the Mahajanapada era during the reign of Bimbisara (c.\u2009558 \u2013 c.\u2009491 BCE), the ruler of the Magadha empire, and died during the early years of the reign of Ajasattu, who was the successor of Bimbisara, thus making him a younger contemporary of Mahavira, the Jain tirthankara. Apart from the Vedic Brahmins, the Buddha's lifetime coincided with the flourishing of influential \u015arama\u1e47a schools of thought like \u0100j\u012bvika, Jainism, and Ajñana. Brahmajala Sutta records sixty-two such schools of thought. It was also the age of influential thinkers like Mahavira (referred to as 'Nigantha Nataputta' in Pali Canon)), P\u016bra\u1e47a Kassapa, Makkhali Gos\u0101la, Ajita Kesakambal\u012b, Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana, and Sañjaya Bela\u1e6d\u1e6dhaputta, as recorded in Samaññaphala Sutta, whose viewpoints the Buddha most certainly must have been acquainted with. Indeed, Sariputta and Moggall\u0101na, two of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, were formerly the foremost disciples of Sañjaya Bela\u1e6d\u1e6dhaputta, the skeptic; and the Pali canon frequently depicts Buddha engaging in debate with the adherents of rival schools of thoughts. Thus, Buddha was just one of the many \u015brama\u1e47a philosophers of that time. There is also evidence to suggest that the two masters, Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, were indeed historical figures and they most probably taught Buddha two different forms of meditative techniques. While the general sequence of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" is widely accepted, there is less consensus on the veracity of many details contained in traditional biographies.\u000aThe times of Gautama's birth and death are uncertain. Most historians in the early 20th century dated his lifetime as circa 563 BCE to 483 BCE. More recently his death is dated later, between 411 and 400 BCE, while at a symposium on this question held in 1988, the majority of those who presented definite opinions gave dates within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's death. These alternative chronologies, however, have not yet been accepted by all historians.\u000aThe evidence of the early texts suggests that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama was born into the Shakya clan, a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the eastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE. It was either a small republic, or an oligarchy, and his father was an elected chieftain, or oligarch. According to the Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born in Lumbini, now in modern-day Nepal, and raised in the Shakya capital of Kapilvastu, which may have been either in what is present day Tilaurakot, Nepal or Piprahwa, India. He obtained his enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, gave his first sermon in Sarnath, and died in Kushinagar.\u000aNo written records about Gautama were found from his lifetime or some centuries thereafter. One Edict of Asoka, who reigned from circa 269 BCE to 232 BCE, commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to the Buddha's birthplace in Lumbini. Another one of his edicts mentions several Dhamma texts, establishing the existence of a written Buddhist tradition at least by the time of the Maurya era. These texts may be the precursor of the P\u0101li Canon.  The oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the Gandh\u0101ran Buddhist texts, reported to have been found in or around Ha\u1e0d\u1e0da near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan and now preserved in the British Library. They are written in the G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b language using the Kharosthi script on twenty-seven birch bark manuscripts and date from the first century BCE to the third century CE.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Traditional biographies ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Biographical sources ===\u000aThe sources for the life of Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama are a variety of different, and sometimes conflicting, traditional biographies. These include the Buddhacarita, Lalitavistara S\u016btra, Mah\u0101vastu, and the Nid\u0101nakath\u0101. Of these, the Buddhacarita is the earliest full biography, an epic poem written by the poet A\u015bvagho\u1e63a in the first century CE. The Lalitavistara S\u016btra is the next oldest biography, a Mah\u0101y\u0101na/Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da biography dating to the 3rd century CE. The Mah\u0101vastu from the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika Lokottarav\u0101da tradition is another major biography, composed incrementally until perhaps the 4th century CE. The Dharmaguptaka biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive, and is entitled the Abhini\u1e63krama\u1e47a S\u016btra, and various Chinese translations of this date between the 3rd and 6th century CE. The Nid\u0101nakath\u0101 is from the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka and was composed in the 5th century by Buddhagho\u1e63a.\u000aFrom canonical sources, the Jataka tales, the Mahapadana Sutta (DN 14), and the Achariyabhuta Sutta (MN 123) which include selective accounts that may be older, but are not full biographies. The J\u0101takas retell previous lives of Gautama as a bodhisattva, and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest Buddhist texts. The Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta and Achariyabhuta Sutta both recount miraculous events surrounding Gautama's birth, such as the bodhisattva's descent from the Tu\u1e63ita Heaven into his mother's womb.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Nature of traditional depictions ===\u000a\u000aIn the earliest Buddhists texts, the nik\u0101yas and \u0101gamas, the Buddha is not depicted as possessing omniscience (sabbaññu) nor is he depicted as being an eternal transcendent (lokottara) being. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, ideas of the Buddha's omniscience (along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography) are found only later, in the Mahayana sutras and later Pali commentaries or texts such as the Mah\u0101vastu. In the Sandaka Sutta, the Buddha's disciple Ananda outlines an argument against the claims of teachers who say they are all knowing  while in the Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta the Buddha himself states that he has never made a claim to being omniscient, instead he claimed to have the "higher knowledges" (abhijñ\u0101). The earliest biographical material from the Pali Nikayas focuses on the Buddha's life as a \u015brama\u1e47a, his search for enlightenment under various teachers such as Alara Kalama and his forty five year career as a teacher.\u000aTraditional biographies of Gautama generally include numerous miracles, omens, and supernatural events. The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. lokottara) and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the Mah\u0101vastu, over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supra-mundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such "in conformity with the world"; omniscience, and the ability to "suppress karma". Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a secular understanding of Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.\u000aAndrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:\u000a\u000aIt is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a mah\u0101puru\u1e63a, "superman"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a god; and in the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta he states that he could live for an aeon were he asked to do so.\u000a\u000aThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the Jain scriptures, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in Indian history for which significant accounts exist. British author Karen Armstrong writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure. Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of "birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death" must be true.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conception and birth ===\u000a\u000aThe Buddhist tradition regards Lumbini, in present-day Nepal to be the birthplace of the Buddha. He grew up in Kapilavastu. The exact site of ancient Kapilavastu is unknown. It may have been either Piprahwa, Uttar Pradesh, present-day India, or Tilaurakot, present-day Nepal. Both places belonged to the Sakya territory, and are located only 15 miles apart.\u000aGautama was born as a Kshatriya, the son of \u015auddhodana, "an elected chief of the Shakya clan", whose capital was Kapilavastu, and who were later annexed by the growing Kingdom of Kosala during the Buddha's lifetime. Gautama was the family name. His mother, Maya (M\u0101y\u0101dev\u012b), Suddhodana's wife, was a Koliyan princess. Legend has it that, on the night Siddhartha was conceived, Queen Maya dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side, and ten months later Siddhartha was born. As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilvastu for her father's kingdom to give birth. However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a sal tree.\u000aThe day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Theravada countries as Vesak. Buddha's Birthday is called Buddha Purnima in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (P\u0101li: Siddhattha), meaning "he who achieves his aim". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer Asita journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king (chakravartin) or a great sadhu. By traditional account, this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight Brahmin scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man. Kondañña, the youngest, and later to be the first arhat other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a Buddha.\u000aWhile later tradition and legend characterized \u015auddhodana as a hereditary monarch, the descendant of the Suryavansha (Solar dynasty) of Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku (P\u0101li: Okk\u0101ka), many scholars think that \u015auddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.\u000aEarly texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition. The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy, and seems to have been structured either as an oligarchy, or as a form of republic. The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the \u015bramanic Jain and Buddhist sanghas, where monarchies tended toward Vedic Brahmanism.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early life and marriage ===\u000a\u000aSiddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, Maha Pajapati. By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince, and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. Although more recent scholarship doubts this status, his father, said to be King \u015auddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human suffering.\u000aWhen he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named Ya\u015bodhar\u0101 (P\u0101li: Yasodhar\u0101). According to the traditional account, she gave birth to a son, named R\u0101hula. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Renunciation and ascetic life ===\u000a\u000aAt the age of 29 Siddhartha left his palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer Channa explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a diseased man, a decaying corpse, and an ascetic. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome aging, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.\u000aAccompanied by Channa and riding his horse Kanthaka, Gautama quit his palace for the life of a mendicant. It's said that, "the horse's hooves were muffled by the gods" to prevent guards from knowing of his departure.\u000aGautama initially went to Rajagaha and began his ascetic life by begging for alms in the street. After King Bimbisara's men recognised Siddhartha and the king learned of his quest, Bimbisara offered Siddhartha the throne. Siddhartha rejected the offer, but promised to visit his kingdom of Magadha first, upon attaining enlightenment.\u000aHe left Rajagaha and practised under two hermit teachers of yogic meditation. After mastering the teachings of Alara Kalama (Skr. \u0100r\u0101\u1e0da K\u0101l\u0101ma), he was asked by Kalama to succeed him. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice, and moved on to become a student of yoga with Udaka Ramaputta (Skr. Udraka R\u0101maputra). With him he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, and was again asked to succeed his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied, and again moved on.\u000aSiddhartha and a group of five companions led by Kaundinya are then said to have set out to take their austerities even further. They tried to find enlightenment through deprivation of worldly goods, including food, practising self-mortification. After nearly starving himself to death by restricting his food intake to around a leaf or nut per day, he collapsed in a river while bathing and almost drowned. Siddhartha was rescued by a village girl named Sujata and she gave him some payasam (a pudding made from milk and jaggery) after which Siddhartha got back some energy. Siddhartha began to reconsider his path. Then, he remembered a moment in childhood in which he had been watching his father start the season's ploughing. He attained a concentrated and focused state that was blissful and refreshing, the jh\u0101na.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Awakening ===\u000a\u000aAccording to the early Buddhist texts, after realizing that meditative dhyana was the right path to awakening, but that extreme asceticism didn't work, Gautama discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way\u2014a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification, or the Noble Eightfold Path, as described in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which is regarded as the first discourse of the Buddha. In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata. Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.\u000aFollowing this incident, Gautama was famously seated under a pipal tree\u2014now known as the Bodhi tree\u2014in Bodh Gaya, India, when he vowed never to arise until he had found the truth. Kaundinya and four other companions, believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined, left. After a reputed 49 days of meditation, at the age of 35, he is said to have attained Enlightenment, and became known as the Buddha or "Awakened One" ("Buddha" is also sometimes translated as "The Enlightened One").\u000aAccording to some sutras of the Pali canon, at the time of his awakening he realized complete insight into the Four Noble Truths, thereby attaining liberation from samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth, suffering and dying again. According to scholars, this story of the awakening and the stress on "liberating insight" is a later development in the Buddhist tradition, where the Buddha may have regarded the practice of dhyana as leading to Nirvana and moksha.\u000aNirvana is the extinguishing of the "fires" of desire, hatred, and ignorance, that keep the cycle of suffering and rebirth going. Nirvana is also regarded as the "end of the world", in that no personal identity or boundaries of the mind remain. In such a state, a being is said to possess the Ten Characteristics, belonging to every Buddha.\u000aAccording to a story in the \u0100y\u0101cana Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1) \u2014 a scripture found in the P\u0101li and other canons \u2014 immediately after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he should teach the Dharma to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, Brahm\u0101 Sahampati convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Formation of the sangha ===\u000a\u000aAfter his awakening, the Buddha met Taphussa and Bhallika \u2014 two merchant brothers from the city of Balkh in what is currently Afghanistan \u2014 who became his first lay disciples. It is said that each was given hairs from his head, which are now claimed to be enshrined as relics in the Shwe Dagon Temple in Rangoon, Burma. The Buddha intended to visit Asita, and his former teachers, Alara Kalama and Udaka Ramaputta, to explain his findings, but they had already died.\u000aHe then travelled to the Deer Park near Varanasi (Benares) in northern India, where he set in motion what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma by delivering his first sermon to the five companions with whom he had sought enlightenment. Together with him, they formed the first sa\u1e45gha: the company of Buddhist monks.\u000aAll five become arahants, and within the first two months, with the conversion of Yasa and fifty four of his friends, the number of such arahants is said to have grown to 60. The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, with their reputed 200, 300 and 500 disciples, respectively. This swelled the sangha to more than 1,000.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Travels and teaching ===\u000a\u000aFor the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the Gangetic Plain, in what is now Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and southern Nepal, teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to servants, murderers such as Angulimala, and cannibals such as Alavaka. Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it's likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, of which Pali may be a standardization.\u000aThe sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the V\u0101san\u0101 rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.\u000a\u000aThe first vassana was spent at Varanasi when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to Rajagaha, capital of Magadha, to visit King Bimbisara. During this visit, Sariputta and Maudgalyayana were converted by Assaji, one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, capital of Magadha.\u000aUpon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to Kapilavastu. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message, and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by Kaludayi, a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.\u000aNow two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:\u000a\u000a"Ours is the warrior lineage of Mahamassata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms."\u000a\u000aThe Buddha is said to have replied:\u000a\u000a"That is not the custom of your royal lineage. But it is the custom of my Buddha lineage. Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking alms."\u000a\u000aBuddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk. After this he is said to have become a sotapanna. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the sangha. The Buddha's cousins Ananda and Anuruddha became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son Rahula also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother Nanda also joined and became an arahant.\u000aOf the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, Maudgalyayana, Mahakasyapa, Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of Upali, Subhoti, Rahula, Mahakaccana and Punna.\u000aIn the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near Vesali when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.\u000a\u000aThe king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother Maha Pajapati, for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules (Vinaya) to follow.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mahaparinirvana ===\u000a\u000aAccording to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant \u0100nanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha. Mettanando and von Hinüber argue that the Buddha died of mesenteric infarction, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.\u000aThe precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms; the Theravada tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the Mahayana tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom. These may reflect the different traditional views on Buddhist vegetarianism and the precepts for monks and nuns.\u000aWaley suggests that Theravadin's would take suukaramaddava (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as pig-soft, to mean "soft flesh of a pig" or "pig's soft-food", that is, after Neumann, a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a truffle. He argues (also after Neumann) that as "(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical", as there are several plants known to have suukara- (pig) as part of their names, and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, suukaramaddava could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.\u000aAccording to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha died at Ku\u015bin\u0101ra (present-day Kushinagar, India), which became a pilgrimage center. Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of Ku\u015bin\u0101ra of the Malla kingdom. The Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king and the appropriate place for him to die.\u000aThe Buddha then asked all the attendant Bhikkhus to clarify any doubts or questions they had and cleared them all in a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: "All composite things (Sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra) are perishable. Strive for your own liberation with diligence" (Pali: 'vayadhamm\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101 appam\u0101dena samp\u0101deth\u0101'). His body was cremated and the relics were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present. For example, The Temple of the Tooth or "Dalada Maligawa" in Sri Lanka is the place where what some believe to be the relic of the right tooth of Buddha is kept at present.\u000a\u000aAccording to the P\u0101li historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, the D\u012bpava\u1e43sa and Mah\u0101va\u1e43sa, the coronation of Emperor A\u015boka (P\u0101li: Asoka) is 218 years after the death of the Buddha. According to two textual records in Chinese (\u5341\u516b\u90e8\u8ad6 and \u90e8\u57f7\u7570\u8ad6), the coronation of Emperor A\u015boka is 116 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Therav\u0101da record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Therav\u0101da countries is 544 or 545 BCE, because the reign of Emperor A\u015boka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates. In Burmese Buddhist tradition, the date of the Buddha's death is 13 May 544 BCE. whereas in Thai tradition it is 11 March 545 BCE.\u000aAt his death, the Buddha is famously believed to have told his disciples to follow no leader. Mahakasyapa was chosen by the sangha to be the chairman of the First Buddhist Council, with the two chief disciples Maudgalyayana and Sariputta having died before the Buddha.\u000a\u000aWhile in the Buddha's days he was addressed by the very respected titles Buddha, Sh\u0101kyamuni, Sh\u0101kyasimha, Bhante and Bho, he was known after his parinirvana as Arihant, Bhagav\u0101/Bhagavat/Bhagw\u0101n, Mah\u0101vira, Jina/Jinendra, S\u0101str, Sugata, and most popularly in scriptures as Tath\u0101gata.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Relics ===\u000a\u000aAfter his death, Buddha's cremation relics were divided amongst 8 royal families and his disciples; centuries later they would be enshrined by King Ashoka into 84,000 stupas. Many supernatural legends surround the history of alleged relics as they accompanied the spread of Buddhism and gave legitimacy to rulers.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Physical characteristics ==\u000a\u000aAn extensive and colorful physical description of the Buddha has been laid down in scriptures. A kshatriya by birth, he had military training in his upbringing, and by Shakyan tradition was required to pass tests to demonstrate his worthiness as a warrior in order to marry. He had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general. He is also believed by Buddhists to have "the 32 Signs of the Great Man".\u000aThe Brahmin Sonadanda described him as "handsome, good-looking, and pleasing to the eye, with a most beautiful complexion. He has a godlike form and countenance, he is by no means unattractive." (D, I:115)\u000a"It is wonderful, truly marvellous, how serene is the good Gotama's appearance, how clear and radiant his complexion, just as the golden jujube in autumn is clear and radiant, just as a palm-tree fruit just loosened from the stalk is clear and radiant, just as an adornment of red gold wrought in a crucible by a skilled goldsmith, deftly beaten and laid on a yellow-cloth shines, blazes and glitters, even so, the good Gotama's senses are calmed, his complexion is clear and radiant." (A, I:181)\u000aA disciple named Vakkali, who later became an arahant, was so obsessed by the Buddha's physical presence that the Buddha is said to have felt impelled to tell him to desist, and to have reminded him that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.\u000aAlthough there are no extant representations of the Buddha in human form until around the 1st century CE (see Buddhist art), descriptions of the physical characteristics of fully enlightened buddhas are attributed to the Buddha in the Digha Nikaya's Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta (D, I:142). In addition, the Buddha's physical appearance is described by Yasodhara to their son Rahula upon the Buddha's first post-Enlightenment return to his former princely palace in the non-canonical Pali devotional hymn, Naras\u012bha G\u0101th\u0101 ("The Lion of Men").\u000aAmong the 32 main characteristics it is mentioned that Buddha has blue eyes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Nine virtues ==\u000aRecollection of nine virtues attributed to the Buddha is a common Buddhist meditation and devotional practice called Buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti. The nine virtues are also among the 40 Buddhist meditation subjects. The nine virtues of the Buddha appear throughout the Tipitaka, and include:\u000aBuddho \u2013 Awakened\u000aSammasambuddho \u2013 Perfectly self-awakened\u000aVijja-carana-sampano \u2013 Endowed with higher knowledge and ideal conduct.\u000aSugato \u2013 Well-gone or Well-spoken.\u000aLokavidu \u2013 Wise in the knowledge of the many worlds.\u000aAnuttaro Purisa-damma-sarathi \u2013 Unexcelled trainer of untrained people.\u000aSatthadeva-Manussanam \u2013 Teacher of gods and humans.\u000aBhagavathi \u2013 The Blessed one\u000aAraham \u2013 Worthy of homage. An Arahant is "one with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Teachings ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Use of Brahmanical motifs ===\u000aIn the Pali Canon, the Buddha uses many Brahmanical devices. For example, in Samyutta Nikaya 111, Majjhima Nikaya 92 and Vinaya i 246 of the Pali Canon, the Buddha praises the Agnihotra as the foremost sacrifice and the Gayatri mantra as the foremost meter:\u000a\u000aaggihuttamukh\u0101 yaññ\u0101 s\u0101vitt\u012b chandaso mukham.\u000aSacrifices have the agnihotra as foremost; of meter the foremost is the S\u0101vitr\u012b.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Tracing the oldest teachings ===\u000aInformation of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin Pali Canon and other texts. The reliability of these sources, and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute. According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.\u000aAccording to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished:\u000a"Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out. According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers" and Richard Gombrich. Richard Gombrich: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius. By "the main edifice" I mean the collections of the main body of sermons, the four Nik\u0101yas, and of the main body of monastic rules."\u000a"Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"\u000a"Cautious optimism in this respect."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dhyana and insight ===\u000aA core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between dhyana and insight. Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Earliest Buddhism ===\u000a\u000aAccording to Tilmann Vetter, the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of dhy\u0101na, as a workable alternative to painful ascetic practices. Bronkhorst agrees that Dhy\u0101na was a Buddhist invention, whereas Norman notes that "the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices." Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.\u000aAccording to the Mah\u0101saccakasutta, from the fourth jhana the Buddha gained bodhi. Yet, it is not clear what he was awakened to. According to Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, "liberating insight" is a later addition to this text, and reflects a later development and understanding in early Buddhism. The mentioning of the four truths as constituting "liberating insight" introduces a logical problem, since the four truths depict a linear path of practice, the knowledge of which is in itself not depicted as being liberating:\u000a\u000a[T]hey do not teach that one is released by knowing the four noble truths, but by practicing the fourth noble truth, the eightfold path, which culminates in right samadhi.\u000a\u000aAlthough "Nibb\u0101na" (Sanskrit: Nirv\u0101na) is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, many other terms can be found throughout the Nikayas, which are not specified.\u000aAccording to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way". In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.\u000aAccording to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the four truths became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas. According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight". Gotama's teachings may have been personal, "adjusted to the need of each person."\u000aThe three marks of existence may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to his listeners.\u000aThe Brahma-vihara was in origin probably a brahmanic term; but its usage may have been common to the Sramana traditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Later developments ===\u000aIn time, "liberating insight" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition. The following teachings, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this "liberating insight":\u000aThe Four Noble Truths: that suffering is an ingrained part of existence; that the origin of suffering is craving for sensuality, acquisition of identity, and fear of annihilation; that suffering can be ended; and that following the Noble Eightfold Path is the means to accomplish this;\u000aThe Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;\u000aDependent origination: the mind creates suffering as a natural product of a complex process.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other religions ==\u000a\u000aBuddha's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and consequently [at least atheistic] Buddhism is generally viewed as a n\u0101stika school (heterodox, literally "It is not so") from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism.\u000aSome Hindus regard Gautama as the 9th avatar of Vishnu. The Buddha is also regarded as a prophet by the Shia Islam Ahmadiyya Muslims  and a Manifestation of God in the Bahá'í Faith. Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of Laozi.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Vietnam ===\u000aDisciples of the Cao \u0110ài religion worship the Buddha as a major religious teacher. His image can be found in both their Holy See and on the home altar. He is revealed during communication with Divine Beings as son of their Supreme Being (God the Father) together with other major religious teachers and founders like Jesus, Laozi, and Confucius.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Western world ===\u000aThe Christian Saint Josaphat is based on the Buddha. The name comes from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva via Arabic B\u016bdhasaf and Georgian Iodasaph. The only story in which St. Josaphat appears, Barlaam and Josaphat, is based on the life of the Buddha. Josaphat was included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November) \u2014 though not in the Roman Missal \u2014 and in the Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar (26 August).\u000aIn the ancient Gnostic sect of Manichaeism, the Buddha is listed among the prophets who preached the word of God before Mani.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Depiction in arts and media ==\u000aFilms\u000a\u000aLittle Buddha, a 1994 film by Bernardo Bertolucci\u000aPrem Sanyas, a 1925 silent film, directed by Franz Osten and Himansu Rai\u000aTelevision\u000aBuddha, a 2013 mythological drama on Zee TV\u000aLiterature\u000aThe Light of Asia, an 1879 epic poem by Edwin Arnold\u000aBuddha, a manga series that ran from 1972 to 1983 by Osamu Tezuka\u000aSiddhartha novel by Hermann Hesse, written in German in 1922\u000aLord of Light, a novel by Roger Zelazny depicts a man in a far future Earth Colony who takes on the name and teachings of the Budda\u000aMusic\u000aKaruna Nadee, a 2010 oratorio by Dinesh Subasinghe\u000aThe Light of Asia, an 1886 oratorio by Dudley Buck\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000aSubnotes\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Printed sources ===\u000aCitations\u000a\u000aBibliography\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Online sources ===\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aWorks by Buddha at Project Gutenberg\u000aWorks by or about Buddha at Internet Archive\u000aWorks by or about Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama at Internet Archive\u000aWorks by or about Shakyamuni at Internet Archive\u000aWorks by Gautama Buddha at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \u000a\u000aBuddha on In Our Time at the BBC.
