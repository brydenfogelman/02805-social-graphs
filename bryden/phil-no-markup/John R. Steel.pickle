He earned his Ph.D. in Logic & the Methodology of Science at Berkeley in 1977 under the joint supervision of John West Addison, Jr. and Stephen G. Simpson.\u000aIn 2015 the European Set Theory Society awarded him and Ronald Jensen the Hausdorff medal for their paper "K without a measurable".\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aHome page at Berkeley
