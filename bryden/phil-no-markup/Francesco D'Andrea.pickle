He was active in philosophical circles, including in the Accademia degli Investiganti, which sought to promote modern natural philosophy and the thought of Descartes. In 1688, he was named a judge on the Vicaria tribunal, and later served as a legal advisor to the Neapolitan crown.\u000aD'Andrea's legal writings focused on issues of constitutional law in the context of the Kingdom of Naples.
