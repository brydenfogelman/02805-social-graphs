VCesare Brandi (Siena, 8 April 1906 \u2013 Vignano, 19 January 1988) was an art critic and historian, specialist in conservation-restoration theory.\u000aIn 1939 he became the first director of the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (Central Institute for Restoration, now the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro) in Rome.\u000aHis main books on art interpretation are Le due vie (1966, Bari), and Teoria generale della critica (1974). Le due vie was presented and debated in Rome by Roland Barthes, Giulio Carlo Argan and Emilio Garroni. The philosopher he felt mostly closer to was Heidegger, although their positions didn't coincide; for this, he felt also closer to Derrida, particularly to his theorization of Différance.\u000aIn 1963 he published Teoria del Restauro, a landmark theoretical essay on restoration. His theory gave rise to 'trateggio,' a controversial technique for repainting missing or damaged sections of works of art.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u2018Cesare Brandi\u2019, dictionaryofarthistorians.org
