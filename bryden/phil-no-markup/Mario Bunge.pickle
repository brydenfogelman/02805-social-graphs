VMario Augusto Bunge (Spanish: [\u02c8bu\u014bxe]; born September 21, 1919) is an Argentine philosopher, philosopher of science and physicist mainly active in Canada.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aBunge began his studies at the National University of La Plata, graduating with a Ph.D. in physico-mathematical sciences in 1952. He was professor of theoretical physics and philosophy, 1956\u20131966, first at La Plata then at University of Buenos Aires. He was, until his recent retirement at age 90, the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at McGill University in Montreal, where he had been since 1966.\u000aMario Bunge has been distinguished with sixteen honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships by universities from both the Americas and Europe. Bunge is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1984\u2013 ) and of the Royal Society of Canada (1992\u2013 ). In 1982 he was awarded the Premio Príncipe de Asturias (Prince of Asturias Award), in 2009 the Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 2014 the Ludwig von Bertalanffy Award in Complexity Thinking.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aBunge is a prolific intellectual, having written more than 400 papers and 80 books, notably his monumental Treatise on Basic Philosophy in 8 volumes (1974\u20131989), a comprehensive and rigorous study of those philosophical aspects Bunge takes to be the core of modern philosophy: semantics, ontology, epistemology, philosophy of science and ethics. Here, Bunge develops a comprehensive scientific outlook which he then applies to the various natural and social sciences.\u000aHis thinking embodies global systemism, emergentism, rationalism, scientific realism, materialism and consequentialism. Bunge has repeatedly and explicitly denied being a logical positivist, and has written on metaphysics. In the political arena, Bunge has defined himself as a "left-wing liberal" and democratic socialist, in the tradition of John Stuart Mill and José Ingenieros.\u000aPopularly, he is known for his remarks considering psychoanalysis as an example of pseudoscience.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Impact on Culture ==\u000aBunge is also influential in art culture. Today there are bands that pay tribute to him.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000a1960. La ciencia, su método y su filosofía. Buenos Aires: Eudeba.
