(Vtransliteration
p1
VTransliteration is the conversion of a text from one script to another.\u000aFor instance, a Latin transliteration of the Greek phrase "\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1", usually translated as 'Hellenic Republic', is "Ell\u0113nik\u1e17 D\u0113mokratía".\u000aTransliteration is not concerned with representing the sounds of the original, only the characters, ideally accurately and unambiguously. Thus, in the above example, \u03bb\u03bb is transliterated as 'll', but pronounced /l/; \u0394 is transliterated as 'D', but pronounced 'ð'; and \u03b7 is transliterated as '\u0113', though it is pronounced /i/ (exactly like \u03b9) and is not long.\u000aConversely, transcription notes the sounds but not necessarily the spelling. So "\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1" could be transcribed as "elinikí ðimokratía", which does not specify which of the /i/ sounds are written as \u03b7 and which as \u03b9.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Definitions ==\u000aSystematic transliteration is a mapping from one system of writing into another, typically grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling.\u000aTransliteration is opposed to transcription, which maps the sounds of one language into a writing system. Still, most systems of transliteration map the letters of the source script to letters pronounced similarly in the target script, for some specific pair of source and target language. If the relations between letters and sounds are similar in both languages, a transliteration may be very close to a transcription. In practice, there are some mixed transliteration/transcription systems that transliterate a part of the original script and transcribe the rest.\u000aFor many script pairs, there is one or more standard transliteration systems. However, unsystematic transliteration is common.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Difference from transcription ==\u000aIn Modern Greek (and since the Roman Imperial period), the letters <\u03b7> <\u03b9> <\u03c5> and the letter combinations <\u03b5\u03b9> <o\u03b9> <\u03c5\u03b9> are pronounced [i] (except when pronounced as semivowels), and a modern transcription renders them all as <i>; but a transliteration distinguishes them, for example by transliterating to <\u0113> <i> <y> and <ei> <oi> <yi>. (As the ancient pronunciation of <\u03b7> was [\u025b\u02d0], it is often transliterated as an <e> with a macron, even for modern texts.) On the other hand, <\u03b5\u03c5> is sometimes pronounced [ev] and sometimes [ef], depending on the following sound. A transcription distinguishes them, but this is no requirement for a transliteration. The initial letter 'h' reflecting the historical rough breathing in words such as Ell\u0113nik\u0113 should logically be omitted in transcription from Koine Greek on, and from transliteration from 1982 on, but it is nonetheless frequently encountered.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Partial transliteration ==\u000aThere is also another type of transliteration that is not full, but partial or quasi. A source word can be transliterated by first identifying all the applicable prefix and suffix segments based on the letters in the source word. All of these segments, in combination constitute a list of potential partial transliterations. So a partial transliteration can include only prefix or only suffix segments. A partial transliteration will also include some unmapped letters of the source word, namely those letters between the end of the prefix and the beginning of the suffix. The partial transliteration can be \u201cfilled in\u201d by applying additional segment maps. Applying the segment maps can produce additional transliterations if more than one segment mapping applies to a particular combination of characters in the source word.\u000aSome examples or "partial transliterations" are words like "bishop" via Anglo-Saxon biscep from the Greek word "episkopos" and the word "deacon", which is partially transliterated from the Greek word "diakonos".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Challenges ==\u000aA simple example of difficulties in transliteration is the voiceless uvular plosive used in Arabic and other languages. It is pronounced approximately like English [k], except that the tongue makes contact not on the soft palate but on the uvula. Pronunciation varies between different languages, and different dialects of the same language. The consonant is sometimes transliterated into "g", sometimes "k", and sometimes "q" in English. Another example is the Russian letter "\u0425" (kha). It is pronounced as the voiceless velar fricative /x/, like the Scottish pronunciation of \u27e8ch\u27e9 in "loch". This sound is not present in most forms of English, and is often transliterated as "kh", as in Nikita Khrushchev. Many languages have phonemic sounds, such as click consonants, which are quite unlike any phoneme in the language into which they are being transliterated.\u000aSome languages and scripts present particular difficulties to transcribers. These are discussed on separate pages.\u000aAncient Near East\u000aTransliterating cuneiform languages\u000aTransliteration of Ancient Egyptian (see also Egyptian hieroglyphs)\u000ahieroglyphic Luwian\u000a\u000aArmenian language\u000aAvestan\u000aBrahmic family\u000aDevanagari: see Devanagari transliteration\u000aPali\u000aTocharian\u000aMalayalam: see Romanization of Malayalam\u000a\u000aChinese language\u000aTranscription into Chinese characters\u000aromanization of Chinese\u000aCyrillization of Chinese\u000a\u000aClick languages of Africa\u000aKhoisan languages\u000aBantu languages\u000a\u000aEnglish language\u000aHebraization of English\u000a\u000aGreek language\u000aRomanization of Greek\u000aGreek alphabet\u000aLinear B\u000aGreeklish\u000a\u000aJapanese language\u000aRomanization of Japanese\u000aCyrillization of Japanese\u000a\u000aKorean language\u000aRomanization of Korean\u000a\u000aPersian language\u000aPersian alphabet\u000aCyrillic alphabet\u000aRomanization of Persian\u000aPersian chat alphabet\u000a\u000aSemitic languages\u000aUgaritic alphabet\u000aHebrew alphabet\u000aRomanization of Hebrew\u000a\u000aArabic alphabet\u000aRomanization of Arabic\u000aArabic chat alphabet\u000a\u000aSlavic languages written in the Cyrillic or Glagolitic alphabets\u000aRomanization of Belarusian\u000aRomanization of Bulgarian\u000aRomanization of Russian\u000aRomanization of Macedonian\u000aRomanization of Serbian\u000aRomanization of Ukrainian\u000aVolapuk encoding\u000a\u000aThai language\u000aRomanization of Thai\u000a\u000a\u000a== Adopted ==\u000aBuckwalter transliteration\u000aDevanagari transliteration\u000aHans Wehr transliteration\u000aInternational Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\u000aScientific transliteration of Cyrillic\u000aTransliteration of Ancient Egyptian\u000aTransliterations of Manchu\u000aWylie transliteration\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aInternational Components for Unicode\u000aLatin script\u000aList of ISO transliterations\u000aOrthographic transcription\u000aPhonemic orthography\u000aPhonetic transcription\u000aRomanization\u000aSubstitution cipher\u000aTranscription (linguistics)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a\u000aInternational Components for Unicode transliteration services ICU User Guide: Transforms\u000aTransliteration history \u2013 history of the transliteration of Slavic languages into Latin alphabets.\u000aTransliteration of Non-Latin scripts \u2013 Collection of transliteration tables for many non-Latin scripts maintained by Thomas T.
