VGeorge Sotiros Pappas (born 1942) is a professor of philosophy at Ohio State University. Pappas specializes in epistemology, the history of early modern philosophy, philosophy of religion, and metaphysics. He is of Greek and English origin.\u000aHe is the author of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Internalist versus Externalist conceptions of epistemic justification.\u000aHe was co-editor (with Marshall Swain) of Essays on Knowledge and Justification (1978), regarded as a key anthology of essays relating to the Gettier problem and used as a core text in undergraduate epistemology courses.\u000aGeorge Pappas is an editorial consultant of Berkeley Studies.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Studies in Berkeley's philosophy ==\u000aGeorge S. Pappas is known to be a leading Berkeley scholar; his essay \u201cBerkeley and Scepticism\u201d was in 1993 awarded the International Berkeley Prize. Professor Pappas is a regular participant of International Berkeley Conferences. At one such conference, celebrating the 300th anniversary of George Berkeley\u2019s birth, Mr. Pappas propounded a new approach to the relationship between Berkeley\u2019s anti-abstractionism and "esse est percipi" principle. On Pappas reading, Berkeley\u2019s two theses \u2014 that there are no abstract ideas and that sensible objects must be perceived in order to exist \u2014 entail one another.\u000a\u000aPappas\u2019 formulation of the relationship between these two propositions is ingenious and merits his verdict that it is a \u2018very exciting result\u2019 \u2026 So far as I know, his thesis is original. Some writers, to be sure, have some close to suggesting that the first proposition is a necessary condition for the truth of the second, but I cannot think of a commentator who holds that it is both a necessary and sufficient condition.\u000a\u000aPappas' interpretation of Berkeley's \u2018esse is percipi\u2019 thesis has sparked much discussion. In 1989, the Garland Publishing Company brought out a 15-volume collection of major works on Berkeley; Pappas' paper \u201cAbstract ideas and the 'esse is percipi' thesis\u201d was included in the third volume, as it was considered to be a significant contribution to Berkeley scholarship.\u000aPappas developed his treatment of Berkeley\u2019s \u201cesse est percipi\u201d principle to repudiate the "inherence interpretation of Berkeley", upon which Edwin E. Allaire, among others, elaborated\u000a\u000a\u201cThat account is put forward to answer an extremely perplexing question in the history of philosophy: Why did Berkeley embrace idealism, i. e., why did he hold that esse est percipi, that to be is to be perceived? (Hausman 1984, pp. 421\u20132)\u000a\u000aAfter emerging in the early 1960s, the \u201cinherence account\u201d attracted numerous proponents and became an influential element of contemporary Berkeley scholarship. In his paper \u201cIdeas, minds, and Berkeley\u201d Pappas revealed some discrepancies between fountain-head evidences and Allaire\u2019s approach to a reconstruction of Berkeley\u2019s idealism. Pappas' critical examination of the \u201cinherence account\u201d is greatly appreciated by Berkeley scholars. Pappas\u2019 penetrating remarks compelled Edwin B. Allaire to revise and improve his conception. Even those who share Allaire\u2019s account of Berkeley\u2019s idealism acknowledge Pappas\u2019 article to be \u201can excellent review and critique of the IA [inherence account].\u201d\u000aIn 2000 George Pappas published his monograph Berkeley's thought in which some parts were based on earlier papers of his. While writings by A. A. Luce or Geoffrey Warnock are long out dated, the book Berkeley's thought written by Dr Pappas is often included in lists of recommended literature on Berkeley\u2019s philosophy.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Publications ==\u000aPappas, George S.
