VSimon Critchley (born 27 February 1960) is an English philosopher. He writes about the history of philosophy, political theory, religion, ethics, aesthetics, literature and theatre. He studied philosophy and has held visiting professorship at numerous universities. He has authored many books, and his work has been acknowledged. He argues that religious disappointment raises the question of meaning and has to, as he sees it, deal with the problem of nihilism; political disappointment provokes the question of justice and raises the need for a coherent ethics.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life and education ==\u000aCritchley was born on 27 February 1960 in Hertfordshire, England. He studied philosophy and received a BA degree from the University of Essex in 1985 and a PhD in 1988. He obtained his M.Phil. at the University of Nice in 1987.

Since 2004 Critchley has been professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research. He held the chair in philosophy at The New School from 2008\u20132011 and became the Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy in 2011.\u000aHe has held visiting professorships at numerous universities, including Sydney (2000), Notre Dame (2002), Cardozo Law School (2005) and at the University of Oslo (2006). In 2009 he was appointed a part-time professor of philosophy at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, where he runs a summer school and teaches in philosophy and liberal arts. Critchley is also a professor of philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected works ==\u000aCritchley\u2019s early work includes The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and Levinas (Blackwell, 1992) and Very Little... Almost Nothing (Routledge, 1997), which focuses on the relation between philosophy and literature and the problem of nihilism.
