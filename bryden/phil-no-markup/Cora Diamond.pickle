She is the editor of Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics: Cambridge 1939, a collection of lectures assembled from the notes of Wittgenstein's students Norman Malcolm, Rush Rhees, Yorick Smythies, and R.G.

Conant, among others.\u000aDiamond received her BA from Swarthmore College in 1957 and her BPhil from St Hugh's College, Oxford in 1961.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAmerican philosophy\u000aList of American philosophers\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aDiamond's home page at UVa\u000aAn interview with Diamond from 2000 (pdf)\u000aEating Meat and Eating People (pdf)
