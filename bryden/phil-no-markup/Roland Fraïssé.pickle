VRoland Fraïssé (French: [\u0281\u0254l\u0251\u0303 f\u0281ajse]; 12 March 1920 \u2013 30 March 2008) was a French mathematical logician. He received his doctoral degree from the University of Paris in 1953. In his thesis, Fraïssé used the back-and-forth method to determine whether two model-theoretic structures were elementarily equivalent. This method of determining elementary equivalence was later formulated as the Ehrenfeucht\u2013Fraïssé game. Fraïssé worked primarily in relation theory. Another of his important works was the Fraïssé construction of a Fraïssé limit of finite structures. He also introduced the notion of compensor in the theory of posets.\u000aMost of his career was spent as Professor at the University of Provence in Marseille, France.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000aSur quelques classifications des systèmes de relations, thesis, University of Paris, 1953; published in Publications Scientifiques de l'Université d'Alger, series A 1 (1954), 35\u2013182.\u000aCours de logique mathématique, Paris: Gauthier-Villars Éditeur, 1967; second edition, 3 vols., 1971\u20131975; tr. into English and ed. by David Louvish as Course of Mathematical Logic, 2 vols., Dordrecht: Reidel, 1973\u20131974.\u000aTheory of relations, tr. into English by P.
