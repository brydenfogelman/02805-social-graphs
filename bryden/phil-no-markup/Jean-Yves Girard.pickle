VJean-Yves Girard (born 1947) is a French logician working in proof theory. He is the research director (emeritus) at the mathematical institute of Luminy.\u000aHe obtained the CNRS Silver medal in 1983 and is a member of the French Academy of Sciences.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aJean-Yves Girard is an alumnus of the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud.\u000aHe made a name for himself in the 1970s with his proof of strong normalization in a system of second-order logic called System F. This result gave a new proof of Takeuti's conjecture, which was proven a few years earlier by William W. Tait, Moto-o Takahashi and Dag Prawitz. For this purpose, he introduced the notion of reducibility candidate ("candidat de réducibilité"). He is also credited with the discovery of linear logic; the geometry of interaction; ludics; and the mustard watch.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000aErnest Nagel; James R.
