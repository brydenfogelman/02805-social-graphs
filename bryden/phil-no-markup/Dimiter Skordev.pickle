Chairman of the department in 1972-2000. Doyen and pioneer of mathematical logic research in Bulgaria who developed a Bulgarian school in the theory of computability, namely the algebraic (or axiomatic) recursion theory.\u000aSkordev's field of scientific interests include computability and complexity in analysis, mathematical logic, generalized recursion theory, and theory of programs and computation.\u000aSkordev has more than 45 years of lecturing experience in calculus, mathematical logic, logic programming, discrete mathematics, and computer science. He authored about 90 scientific publications including two monographs, and was one of the authors of the new Bulgarian phonetic keyboard layout proposed (but rejected) to become a state standard in 2006.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aDimiter Skordev\u000aHistorical notes on the development of mathematical logic in Sofia
