VAlexander (Alekos) Sotirios Kechris (Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b5\u03c7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2; born March 23, 1946) is a descriptive set theorist and ergodic theorist at California Institute of Technology. He has made major contributions to the theory of Borel equivalence relations and the theory of automorphism groups of uncountable structures.\u000aKechris earned his Ph.D. in 1972 under the direction of Yiannis N. Moschovakis, with a dissertation titled Projective Ordinals and Countable Analytic Sets.\u000aIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected publications ==\u000aA.
