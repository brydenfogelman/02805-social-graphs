De La Torre (born October 6, 1958) is a professor of Social Ethics and Latinx Studies at Iliff School of Theology, a scholar-activist, author, and an ordained Southern Baptist minister.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aBorn in Cuba months before the Castro Revolution, De La Torre and his family migrated to the United States as refugees when he was an infant. For a while the U.S. government considered him and his family as "illegal aliens". On June 6, 1960, De La Torre received an order from Immigration and Naturalization Service to "self-deport." He attended Blessed Sacrament School in Queens, New York and was baptized and confirmed by the Catholic Church. Simultaneously, his parents were priest/priestess of the religion Santería. He refers to himself as a Southern Baptist, Roman Catholic child of Ellegúa. He left Queens, moving to Miami, Florida in his teens.\u000aAt nineteen years of age he began a real estate company in Miami called Championship Realty, Century 21; becoming at the time the youngest real estate broker in the State of Florida. The office grew to over 100 sales agents. During this time he obtained a Masters in Public Administration from American University in Washington, DC. Eventually he was elected president of the Miami Board of Realtors. He was also active in local politics, becoming the founding president of the West Dade Young Republicans. In 1988 he was a candidate for the Florida House of Representatives, District 115, but lost to Mario Diaz-Balart.\u000aIn his early twenties he became a "born-again" Christian, joining University Baptist Church in Coral Gables, Florida. De La Torre dissolved the thirteen-year-old real estate company in 1992 to attend Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in order to obtain a Masters in Divinity and enter the ministry. During his seminary training he served as pastor at a rural congregation, Goshen Baptist Church in Glen Dean, Kentucky.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Scholarship ==\u000aDe La Torre continued his theological training and obtained a doctorate from Temple University in social ethics in 1999.

In 2005 he wrote a column for the local newspaper, The Holland Sentinel, titled "When the Bible is Used for Hatred." The article was a satirical piece commenting on Focus on the Family's James Dobson outing of SpongeBob SquarePants. Dobson responded to the article.\u000aA controversy over these articles ensued. A few months afterwards, De La Torre was forced to resign his tenure and took the position of associate professor for social ethics at Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colorado. He became a full professor in 2010.\u000aSince obtaining his doctorate in 1999, De La Torre has authored numerous articles and books, including several books that have won national awards, specifically: Reading the Bible from the Margins, (Orbis, 2002); Santería: The Beliefs and Rituals of a Growing Religion in America (Wm.
