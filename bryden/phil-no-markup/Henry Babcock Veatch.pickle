He opposed such modern and contemporary developments as the "transcendental turn" and the "linguistic turn." A staunch advocate of plain speaking and "Hoosier" common sense, in philosophy and elsewhere, he argued on behalf of realist metaphysics and practical ethics.\u000aVeatch's most widely read book was Rational Man: A Modern Interpretation of Aristotelian Ethics (1962) which explicitly offered a rationalist counterpoint to William Barrett's well-known study in existential philosophy, Irrational Man (1958).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Major works ==\u000aConcerning the Ontological Status of Logical Forms (1948)\u000aAristotelian and Mathematical Logic (1950)\u000aIn Defense of the Syllogism (1950)\u000aMetaphysics and the Paradoxes (1952)\u000aIntentional Logic: A Logic Based on Philosophical Realism (1952)\u000aRealism and Nominalism Revisited (1954)\u000aLogic as a Human Instrument (1959, with Francis Parker)\u000aRational Man: A Modern Interpretation of Aristotelian Ethics (1962)\u000aThe Truths of Metaphysics (1964)\u000aNon-cognitivism in Ethics: A modest proposal for its diagnosis and cure (1966)\u000aTwo Logics: the Conflict between Classical and Neo-Analytic Philosophy (1969)\u000aFor an Ontology of Morals: A Critique of Contemporary Ethical Theory (1971)\u000aAristotle: A Contemporary Appreciation (1974)\u000aHuman Rights: Fact or Fancy (1985)\u000aSwimming Against the Current in Contemporary Philosophy (1990)\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAmerican philosophy\u000aList of American philosophers\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==
