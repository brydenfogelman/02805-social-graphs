VWilhelm Friedrich Ackermann (29 March 1896 \u2013 24 December 1962) was a German mathematician best known for the Ackermann function, an important example in the theory of computation.\u000aAckermann was born in Herscheid municipality, Germany, and was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Göttingen in 1925 for his thesis Begründung des "tertium non datur" mittels der Hilbertschen Theorie der Widerspruchsfreiheit, which was a consistency proof of arithmetic apparently without full Peano induction (although it did use e.g. induction over the length of proofs). From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in Burgsteinfurt, and then at Lüdenscheid until 1961. He was also a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (Academy of Sciences) in Göttingen, and was an honorary professor at the University of Münster.\u000aIn 1928, Ackermann helped David Hilbert turn his 1917 \u2013 22 lectures on introductory mathematical logic into a text, Principles of Mathematical Logic. This text contained the first exposition ever of first-order logic, and posed the problem of its completeness and decidability (Entscheidungsproblem). Ackermann went on to construct consistency proofs for set theory (1937), full arithmetic (1940), type-free logic (1952), and a new axiomatization of set theory (1956).\u000aAlthough Ackermann did not choose a university career and rather continued as a high school teacher, he was continually engaged in research and published many contributions to the foundations of mathematics until the end of his life. He died in Lüdenscheid, Germany.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aAckermann coding\u000aAckermann ordinal\u000aAckermann set theory\u000aAckermann function\u000aInverse Ackermann function\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a1928.
