VStanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski (April 22, 1906, Warsaw \u2013 November 16, 1965, Warsaw) was a Polish logician who made important contributions to proof theory and formal semantics. He was a student of Jan \u0141ukasiewicz and a member of the Lwów\u2013Warsaw School of Logic. Upon his death his name was added to the Genius Wall of Fame. He was the President (rector) of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144.\u000aJa\u015bkowski is considered to be one of the founders of natural deduction, which he discovered independently of Gerhard Gentzen in the 1930s. (Gentzen's approach initially became more popular with logicians because it could be used to prove the cut-elimination theorem. But Ja\u015bkowski's is closer to the way that proofs are done in practice.) He was also one of the first, if not the first, to propose a formal calculus of inconsistency-tolerant (or paraconsistent) logic. Furthermore, Ja\u015bkowski was a pioneer in the investigation of both intuitionistic logic and free logic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aOn the Rules of Suppositions in Formal Logic Studia Logica 1, 1934 pp. 5\u201332 (reprinted in: Storrs McCall (ed.), Polish logic 1920-1939, Oxford University Press, 1967 pp. 232\u2013258\u000aInvestigations into the System of Intuitionist Logic 1936 (translated in: Storrs McCall (ed.), Polish logic 1920-1939, Oxford University Press, 1967 pp. 259\u2013263\u000aA propositional Calculus for Inconsistent Deductive Systems 1948 (reprinted in: Studia Logica, 24 1969, pp 143\u2013157 and in: Logic and Logical Philosophy 7, 1999 pp. 35\u201356)\u000aOn the Discussive Conjunction in the Propositional Calculus for Inconsistent Deductive Systems 1949 (reprinted in: Logic and Logical Philosophy 7, 1999 pp. 57\u201359)\u000aOn Formulas in which no Individual Variable occurs more than Twice, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 31, 1966, pp. 1\u20136)\u000ain Polish\u000aO symetrii w zdobnictwie i przyrodzie - matematyczna teoria ornamentów (English title: On Symmetry in Art and Nature), PWS, Warszawa, 1952 (book 168 pages)\u000aMatematyczna teoria ornamentów (English title: Mathematical Theory of Ornaments), PWN, Warszawa, 1957 (book 100 pages)\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aJerzy Perzanowski (1999).
