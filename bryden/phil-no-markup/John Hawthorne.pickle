VJohn Hawthorne is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southern California. He is recognized as a leading contemporary contributor to metaphysics and epistemology.\u000aHis 2006 collection Metaphysical Essays offers original treatments of fundamental topics in philosophy, including identity, ontology, vagueness, and causation, which one reviewer called "essential reading for anyone currently engaged in analytic metaphysics". In his book Knowledge and Lotteries, Hawthorne defends a view in epistemology according to which the presence of knowledge is dependent on the subject's interests (he calls this view 'Subject-Sensitive Invariantism'). Unlike contextualism, Hawthorne's view does not require that the meaning of the word "know" changes from one context of ascription to another. His view is thus a variety of invariantism. However, whether a subject has knowledge depends to a surprising extent on features of the subject's context, including practical concerns. This position can be classed as a form of pragmatism. The American philosopher Jason Stanley holds a similar view.\u000aHawthorne has also written on philosophy of language and philosophical logic, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, and on Leibniz.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Education ==\u000aHawthorne earned his Ph.D. from Syracuse University, where he studied with William Alston and Jonathan F. Bennett. From 2006-2015, he was the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He has also taught at the University of New South Wales, Arizona State University, Syracuse University, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and Princeton University.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000aThe Reference Book (with David Manley, Oxford University Press, 2012)\u000aRelativism and Monadic Truth (with Herman Cappelen, Oxford University Press 2010)\u000aMetaphysical Essays (Oxford University Press, 2006)\u000aKnowledge and Lotteries (Oxford University Press, 2004)\u000aSubstance and Individuation in Leibniz (with J.
