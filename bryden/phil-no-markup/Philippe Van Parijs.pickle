Essays for Philippe Van Parijs (Axel Gosseries & Yannick Vanderborght eds., Presses universitaires de Louvain, 2012) was published on the occasion of his 60th birthday.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aIn Real Freedom for All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism? (1995) he argues for both the justice and feasibility of a basic income for every citizen. Van Parijs asserts that it promotes the achievement of a real freedom to make choices. For example, he purports that one cannot really choose to stay at home to raise children or start a business if one cannot afford to. As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of income redistribution.\u000aAnother part of Van Parijs' work is about linguistic justice. In order to address the injustice arising from the privilege enjoyed by English as a global lingua franca, he discusses a wide range of measures such as a language tax which would be paid by English-speaking countries, a ban on the dubbing of films, and the enforcement of a linguistic territoriality principle that would protect weaker languages.\u000aVan Parijs's work is sometimes associated with the September Group of analytic Marxism, though he is not himself a committed Marxist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aPersonal homepage\u000a"The Need for Basic Income", interview with Chris Bertram, Imprints, vol. 1, no. 3 (March 1997)\u000aNo conditions attached, interview by the magazine Europe & Me, July 2012
