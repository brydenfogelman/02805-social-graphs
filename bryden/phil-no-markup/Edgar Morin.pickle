VEdgar Morin (French: [m\u0254\u0281\u025b\u0303]; born Edgar Nahoum on 8 July 1921) is a French philosopher and sociologist who has been internationally recognized for his work on complexity and "complex thought," and his scholarly contributions to such diverse fields as media studies, politics, sociology, visual anthropology, ecology, education, systems biology, and beyond. He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aAt the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of Salonica (Thessaloniki) to Marseille and later to Paris, where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish (Sefardi) origin.\u000aWhen the Germans invaded France in 1940, Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance. As a member of the French Resistance he adopted the pseudonym Morin, which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the French Communist Party in 1941.\u000aIn 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in Landau, where he served as a Lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.\u000aIn 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in Le Nouvel Observateur. In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS).\u000aMorin founded and directed the magazine Arguments (1954\u20131962). In 1959 his book Autocritique was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist party focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.\u000aIn 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Mexico. He returned to France where he published L'Esprit du Temps', a work on popular culture.\u000aThat same year, French sociologist Georges Friedmann brought him and Roland Barthes together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name-changes, became the Edgar Morin Centre of the EHESS, Paris.\u000aAlso in 1960 he co-authored the film Chronique d'un été with Jean Rouch an early example of cinéma vérité and direct cinema.\u000aBeginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in Plozévet.\u000aIn 1968, Morin replaced Henri Lefebvre at the University of Nanterre. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for Le Monde that tried to understand what he called "The Student Commune." He followed the student revolt closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called "The Revolution without a Face," as well as co-authoring Mai 68: La brèche with Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude Lefort.\u000aIn 1969 Morin spent a year at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.\u000aIn 1983 he published De la nature de l\u2019URSS, which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the Perestroika of Mikhail Gorbachev.\u000aIn 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium. In this year, he also had a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Work ==\u000aIn addition to being the UNESCO Chair of Complex Thought, Morin is known as a founder of transdisciplinarity and is the holder of a diverse array of honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from no fewer than 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo León, Université de Laval à Québec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro))\u000aThe University of Messina in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), the prestigious French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy. In addition, a university was established recently in Mexico based on his work, Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin.\u000aHe did not embrace the French postmodern or poststructuralist movements and instead pursued his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault and Derrida, and he did not slide into the heredities of traditional academic disciplines in the 1980s and 1990s. His work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has graced the cover of multiple publications including Sciences Humaines and a special issue of Le Monde.\u000aAccording to Alfonso Montuori in "Edgar Morin: A partial introduction"\u000a\u000a"The 5 volume Method is perhaps Morin\u2019s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin\u2019s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works (selection) ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Books ===\u000a1951, L\u2019Homme et la mort\u000a1956, Le cinéma ou l'homme imaginaire\u000a1957, Les Stars\u000a1962, L'Esprit du temps\u000a1969, La Rumeur d\u2019Orléans\u000a1967, Commune en France: La Métamorphose de Plodemet\u000aLa Méthode (6 volumes)\u000a1977, La Nature de la nature\u000a1980, La Vie de la vie\u000a1986, La Connaissance de la connaissance\u000a1991, Les Idées\u000a2001, L\u2019Humanité de l\u2019humanité\u000a2004, L'Éthique complexe\u000a\u000a1970, Journal de Californie\u000a1973, Le paradigme perdu: la nature humaine\u000a1981, Pour sortir du siècle XX\u000a1982, Science avec conscience\u000a1983, De la nature de l\u2019URSS\u000a1988, Penser L'Europe\u000a1990, Introduction à la pensée complexe\u000a1993, Terre-patrie\u000a1994, Mes démons\u000a1994, La Complexité humaine\u000a1997, Comprendre la complexité dans les organisations de soins\u000a1999, L\u2019Intelligence de la complexité\u000a1999, Relier les connaissances\u000a1999, La Tête bien faite\u000a2000, Les Sept savoirs nécessaires à l'éducation du futur\u000a2001, Journal de Plozévet, Bretagne\u000a2002, Pour une politique de civilisation\u000a2002, Dialogue sur la connaissance.
