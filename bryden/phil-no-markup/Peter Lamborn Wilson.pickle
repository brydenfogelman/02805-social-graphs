VPeter Lamborn Wilson (pseudonym Hakim Bey; born 1945) is an American anarchist author, primarily known for advocating the concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Life ==\u000aWilson is the son of Douglas Emory Wilson, an editor at Harvard University Press and Ralph Waldo Emerson scholar, and Margaret Packwood. His parents divorced when he was thirteen.\u000aWhile undertaking a classics major at Columbia University, Wilson met Warren Tartaglia, then introducing Islam to students as the leader of a group called the Noble Moors. Attracted by the philosophy, Wilson was initiated into the group, but later joined a group of breakaway members who founded the Moorish Orthodox Church. The Church maintained a presence at the League for Spiritual Discovery, the cult established by Timothy Leary, and it is alleged Wilson would visit it for supplies of LSD. Leary's sponsor, Mellon fortune heir Billy Hitchcock, cut his ties, and Leary headed to Algiers.\u000aAppalled by the social and political climate, Wilson had also decided to leave America, and shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 he flew to Lebanon. In the words of Michael Muhammad Knight, "The emerging postcolonial world was crowded with American hippies blowing their trust funds on mystical quests\u2026and [Wilson] was one of them."\u000aWilson travelled to India with the intention of studying Sufism, but became fascinated by Tantra, tracking down Ganesh Baba. He spent a month in a Kathmandu missionary hospital being treated for hepatitis, and practised meditation techniques in a cave above the east bank of the Ganges. He also allegedly ingested significant quantities of cannabis.\u000aWilson travelled on to Pakistan. There he lived in several places, mixing with princes, Sufis, and gutter dwellers, and moving from teahouses to opium dens. In Quetta he found "a total disregard of all government", with people reliant on family, clans or tribes, which appealed to the anarchist in him.\u000aWilson then moved to Iran. It was here that he developed his scholarship. He translated classical Persian texts with French scholar Henry Corbin, and also worked as a journalist at the Tehran Journal. In 1974, Farah Pahlavi Empress of Iran, commissioned her personal secretary, scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr, to establish the Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy. Nasr offered Wilson the position of director of its English language publications, and editorship of its journal Sophia Perennis. This Wilson edited from 1975 until 1978.\u000aFollowing the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Wilson lived in New York, sharing a brownstone townhouse with William Burroughs, with whom he bonded over their shared interests. Burroughs acknowledged Wilson for providing material on Hassan-i Sabbah which he used for his novel The Western Lands.\u000aWilson currently lives in upstate New York. A family trust fund enables him to live in a state he terms "independently poor". He has been described as "a subcultural monument".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hakim Bey ==\u000aWilson's occasional pen name of Hakim Bey is derived from il-Hakim, the alchemist-king, with 'Bey' a further nod to Moorish Science. Wilson's two personas, as himself and Bey are facilitated by his publishers who provide separate author biographies even when both appear in the same publication.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Writings ==\u000aIn addition to his writings on ontological anarchy (termed lifestyle anarchism by detractors such as Murray Bookchin) and Temporary Autonomous Zones, Wilson has written essays on other topics such as Tong traditions, the utopian Charles Fourier, the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, alleged connections between Sufism and ancient Celtic culture, technology and Luddism, Amanita muscaria use in ancient Ireland, and sacred pederasty in the Sufi tradition.\u000aWilson's freeform poetry, as Hakim Bey, has appeared in Exquisite Corpse, the Panthology and Acolyte Reader anthologies, Gayme, P.A.N., NAMBLA Bulletin, Ganymede, and various samizdat zines. Many of the poems were collected in an unpublished volume DogStar, praised by Burroughs and Ginsberg. Currently his works can be found regularly in publications like Fifth Estate and the NYC-based First of the Month.\u000aHe has also published at least one novel, The Chronicles of Qamar: Crowstone.\u000aParticularly because of his TAZ work, Wilson has often been embraced by rave subculture, as ravers have identified the experience and occasions of raves as part of the tradition of "Temporary Autonomous Zones" that Bey outlines, particularly the "free party" or teknival scene. Wilson has been supportive of the rave connection, while remarking in an interview, "The ravers were among my biggest readers... I wish they would rethink all this techno stuff \u2014 they didn\u2019t get that part of my writing."\u000aMore recently, he has commented on the Occupy Movement in an interview with David Levi Strauss of The Brooklyn Rail:\u000a\u000aI was beginning to feel that there would never be another American uprising, that the energy was gone, and I have some reasons to think that might be true. I like to point out that the crime rate in America has been declining for a long time, and in my opinion it\u2019s because Americans don\u2019t even have enough gumption to commit crimes anymore: the creative aspect of crime has fallen into decay. As for the uprising that takes a principled stand against violence, hats off to them, I admire the idealism, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to accomplish much.\u000a\u000aIn another interview with David Levi Strauss and Christopher Bamford in The Brooklyn Rail, Bey has discussed his views on what he calls "Green Hermeticism":\u000a\u000aWe all agreed that there is not a sufficient spiritual focus for the environmental movement. And without a spiritual focus, a movement like this doesn\u2019t generate the kind of emotional energy that it needs to battle against global capitalism\u2014that for which there is no other reality, according to most people. It should be a rallying call of the spirit for the environmental movement, or for as many parts of that movement as could be open to it.\u000a\u000aWilson has even taken up commentary on the ontology of quantum physics, interpreting Nick Herbert's Quantum Reality in terms of the social paradigms from which quantum mechanics may draw its metaphors.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable theories ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ontological anarchy ===\u000aIn the compilation of essays called "Immediatism" Wilson explains his particular conception of anarchism and anarchy which he calls "ontological anarchy". In the same compilation he deals with his view of the relationships of individuals with the exterior world as perceived by the senses and a theory of liberation which he calls "immediatism".\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Temporary Autonomous Zones ===\u000aWilson has written articles on three different types of what he calls "autonomous zones". Regarding his concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ) he said in an interview that\u000a\u000athe real genesis was my connection to the communal movement in America, my experiences in the 1960s in places like Timothy Leary's commune in Millbrook...Usually only the religious ones last longer than a generation\u2014and usually at the expense of becoming quite authoritarian, and probably dismal and boring as well. I've noticed that the exciting ones tend to disappear, and as I began to further study this phenomenon, I found that they tend to disappear in a year or a year and a half.\u000a\u000aIn an article on obsessive love, Wilson posited a utopia based on generosity as well as obsession, and wrote:\u000a\u000aI have dreamed this (I remember it suddenly, as if it were literally a dream) \u2014 and it has taken on a tantalizing reality and filtered into my life \u2014 in certain Temporary Autonomous Zones \u2014 an "impossible" time and space ....and on this brief hint, all my theory is based.\u000a\u000aAs such, it may be said that it is part of the eternal vision of an arcadia where desires are fulfilled without reference to the world, and the search for a means of realising it.\u000aThe concept of TAZ was presented in a long elaboration in the book TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Criticism and controversy ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lifestyle anarchism ===\u000aIn Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm, Murray Bookchin included Wilson's work (as Bey) in what he called "lifestyle anarchism", which he criticized Wilson's writing for tendencies towards mysticism, occultism, and irrationalism. Wilson did not respond publicly. Bob Black wrote a rejoinder to Bookchin in Anarchy after Leftism.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Works ==\u000aThe Winter Calligraphy of Ustad Selim, & Other Poems (1975) (Ipswich, England) ISBN 0-903880-05-9\u000aScience and Technology in Islam (1976) (with Leonard Harrow)\u000aTraditional Modes of Contemplation & Action (1977) (editor, with Yusuf Ibish)\u000aNasir-I Khusraw: 40 Poems from the Divan (1977) (translator and editor, with Gholam Reza Aavani) ISBN 0-87773-730-4\u000aDIVAN (1978) (poems, London/Tehran)\u000aKings of Love: The Poetry and History of the Nimatullahi Sufi Order of Iran (1978) (translator and editor, with Nasrollah Pourjavady; Tehran)\u000aAngels (1980, 1994) ISBN 0-500-11017-4 (abridged edition: ISBN 0-500-81044-3)\u000aWeaver of Tales: Persian Picture Rugs (1980) (with Karl Schlamminger)\u000aLoving Boys: Semiotext(e) Special (1980) (editor as Hakim Bey; Semiotext(e) (New York))\u000aDivine Flashes (1982) (by Fakhruddin 'Iraqi, translated and introduced with William C.
