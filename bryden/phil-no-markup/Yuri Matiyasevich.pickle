He is best known for his negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem (Matiyasevich's theorem), presented in his doctoral thesis, at LOMI (the Leningrad Department of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aIn 1962\u20131963, Matiyasevich studied at Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239;\u000aIn 1963\u20131964, he studied at Kolmogorov School;\u000aIn 1964\u20131969, Matiyasevich studied at Mathematics & Mechanics Faculty of Leningrad State University. As a winner of IMO Yuri Matiyasevich was accepted without exams to LSU, skipping the last year of high school studies.\u000aIn 1966, he presented a talk at International Congress of Mathematicians held in Moscow. He was a second-year undergraduate student at that time.\u000aIn 1969\u20131970, he pursued Ph.D. studies at Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics under supervision of Sergey Maslov.\u000aIn 1970, he received his Ph.D. degree at LOMI.\u000aIn 1970\u20131974, he was a researcher at LOMI.\u000aIn 1972, he obtained a second doctoral degree (called "doktor nauk" in Soviet Union).\u000aIn 1974\u20131980, he was a senior researcher at LOMI.\u000aSince 1980, Yuri Matiyasevich has been the head of Laboratory of mathematical logic at LOMI.\u000aSince 1995, he has been a professor of Saint-Petersburg State University, initially at the chair of software engineering, later at the chair of algebra and number theory.\u000aIn 1997, he was elected as a corresponding member of Russian Academy of Sciences.\u000aSince 1998, Yuri Matiyasevich has been a vice-president of St. Petersburg Mathematical Society.\u000aSince 2002, he has been a head of St.Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad.\u000aSince 2003, Matiyasevich has been a co-director of annual German\u2013Russian student school JASS.\u000aIn 2008, he was elected as a full member of Russian Academy of Sciences.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Awards and honors ==\u000a1964: Gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad held in Moscow.\u000a1970: "Young mathematician prize" of the Leningrad Mathematical Society.\u000a1980: Markov Prize of Academy of Sciences of the USSR.\u000a1996: Honorary Degree, Université d'Auvergne.\u000a1998: He received Humboldt Research Award to Outstanding Scholars.\u000a2003: Honorary Degree, Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC).\u000a2007: Member of the Bayern Academy of Sciences.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notable facts ==\u000aA polynomial related to colorings of triangulation of sphere was named after Matiyasevich; see The Matiyasevich polynomial, four colour theorem and weight systems.\u000aHe was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the Association for Symbolic Logic; and also of the editorial boards for the journals Discrete Mathematics and Applications and Computer Instruments in Education.\u000aNotable students include: Eldar Musayev, Maxim Vsemirnov, Alexei Pastor, Dmitri Karpov.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Selected works ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Book ===\u000aYuri Matiyasevich Hilbert's 10th Problem, Foreword by Martin Davis and Hilary Putnam, The MIT Press, 1993.
