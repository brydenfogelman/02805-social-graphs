VShadworth Hollway Hodgson (1832-1912) was an English philosopher.\u000aHe worked independently, without academic affiliation. He was acknowledged by William James  as a forerunner of Pragmatism, although he viewed his work as a completion of Kant's project. Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the "Scratch Eight." Hodgson regarded the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the Metaphysical Society.\u000aHe was the first president of the Aristotelian Society and held that post from 1880 to 1894.\u000aHis principal work was The Metaphysic of Experience (1898) which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of empiricism in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.\u000aAttention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by Wolfe Mays in a British Phenomenology journal in the 1970s.\u000aThe volumes of Hodgson's principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aInternet Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Hodgson\u000aPhilosophy of Reflection at openlibrary.org\u000aThe metaphysic of experience University of Wisconsin - Madison scan\u000aWm James on Hodgson
